3102001,2013001,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/lastories.html,LA Stories â€” Writing on the Job, Income & Employment,"Los Angeles suffers from some of the highest rates of unemployment in the nation, and is also home to the nationâ€™s largest population of storytellers. Coincidence? We hope not! 5812 Design Lab proposes to unpack these facts in the context of LA through the production of a book titled â€œWriting on the Job,â€ launching the â€œLA Storiesâ€ series of books with topical, engaging stories on Los Angeles. This initial volume will revolved around the theme of jobs. What is the landscape of employment in Los Angeles? How is the everyperson faring in todayâ€™s world? What might a future world look like for jobs in LA? What are the unknown, overlooked, and strange stories that havenâ€™t been told? By engaging with poets, fiction and nonfiction authors, screenwriters and playwrights, journalists, and writers of all stripes, we hope to achieve several goals.


<br><br>


First, we will provide an alternative medium to the talking heads that the mainstream media provides through storytelling in new scopes, from an intimate story of a family going through economic hardship, to the big picture vision that a scifi novella can provide but that nonfiction accounts often overlook. We believe that this approach offers new insight into the wellworn ground of economic hardship that we have all experienced over the past several years. The book will be directly distributed free of charge to local libraries, schools, and similar public institutions so it can be disseminated throughout the city, and can provide a cause for communitybuilding book launch events throughout LA.


<br><br>


Second, we believe that storytelling is, in fact, a radical means to create real change. So often, our reality is dictated by the stories we hear and tell, and to change those stories with intention offers an escape from this selffulfilling cycle. Storytelling offers a way for people from different cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds to relate to one another, to understand one another, and to create positive social change. So we believe that beyond mere media, our collection of stories will spark real change for employment and income in Los Angeles.


<br><br>


Third, we believe that by partnering with storytellers, one of the largest and most underemployed groups in Los Angeles, we will be able to offer real and direct support through a grant given to each writer contained in the volume, as well as through editorial support and name recognition. We hope that LA Stories will continue from the success of this initial volume, becoming an LA institution that supports, fosters, and promotes writers in this city. LA has amazing human capital in this area but it will take a project like LA Stories: Writing on the Job to galvanize this group, and to create a community that can project the individual storytellers beyond competition to shared success.","5812 Design Lab is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization formed and registered in the State of California. In 2009, three friends at UCLA who were going into architecture, law, and business sought to use the power of good design in order create positive social change. They embarked on a journey that led them somewhere between anthropology, journalism, and design and this unique approach has continued as the organization now focuses on placebased, social research and media production that reveals the overlooked, the misunderstood, and the opaque.


<br><br>


Our organizations achievements are intimate, personal, and real: we engage directly with disenfranchised communities to make their stories heard. We are strong believers in the power of storytelling, and the achievements we are most proud of include a multimedia journalistic exploration of migrant workers around the 2008 World Expo in Shanghai, another exploration of an amazing community of people that live in buses in Venice, and a public awareness campaign for Los Angeles that encourages people to meet their neighbors.


<br><br>


We have also partnered with a number of individuals and institutions in order to achieve our goals, including designers, storytellers, researchers, and cool folks like the people at metaLAB at Harvard. They developed a web application called Zeega that we are currently working with to tell the story of Hmong communities in California, among other things.","We will collaborate directly with about fifty storytellers: poets, fiction and nonfiction authors, screenwriters and playwrights, journalists, and writers of all stripes. We will work with existing and upandcoming institutions in Los Angeles in order to find the best and most diverse set of writers to work directly on this jobsthemed edition. Some of those institutions may include the Los Angeles Review of Books, UCLA and USC, 826LA, the Last Bookstore, and other similar organizations.","We will measure success one two fronts: First, we aim to create a beautiful, welldesigned, riveting, pleasurable book that can be enjoyed by people around the world, by Angelenos, and at no cost to local public institutions. We will measure success through a rigorous editorial process for book production that will gauge responses and respond to those responses as we move forward. This will include responses from collaborators as we produce the book, from outside reviewers prior to production, and from the general public after the book is produced. This knowledge will build over time as we use the success from this initial volume to create the next LA Stories edition. 


<br><br>


Second, we aim to foster a literary community in Los Angeles that is galvanized around the book series, and is in partnership with the variety of wonderful storytelling institutions around the city. We will measure success on this front by engaging in a meaningful way with writers, and by seeing them succeed on the world stage. We imagine that this project can be the catalyst the propels Los Angeles into the imagination of the world as the preeminent contemporary literary city, and that this success will map directly onto better employment and income for that largest and most underemployed job group in LA, storytellers.","Our project will directly benefit Los Angeles in three ways. First, it will provide an alternative medium through which we can understand our city and, in particular, understand its landscape of employment and income. By understanding this landscape, we can begin to understand not only better understand the problems that our city faces, but more importantly we can begin to know the right questions to ask as we move out of the recession and into a vibrant, productive city for the twentyfirst century. This understanding will be directly encouraged through the free distribution of the volume to schools, libraries, and other public intuitions, providing these organizations an opportunity for communitybuilding events, and directly providing them with a new resource.





Second, it will spark positive change through new mutual understanding, shared connections and experiences, and the perception of potential futures. Storytelling is the catalyst for change not only with income and employment, but also with a shared rapport across the entire city, and across its many neighborhoods and communities.





And third, it will provide employment and income to the largest and most underemployed group in Los Angeles: storytellers. By partnering with poets, fiction and nonfiction authors, screenwriters and playwrights, journalists, and writers of all stripes, we will foster a community out of what is currently a fragmented yet incredibly potentialfilled group, and we will promote a new generation of literary greatness in Los Angeles.


","Success in 2050 would look like this: Los Angeles would be known around the world as the preeminent city for contemporary literary culture. But more importantly, it would be known as a city that fosters creativity and keeps talent because of its supportive culture. It wouldnâ€™t follow the conventional rules of high or low cultureâ€”just that culture would be produced, from kids in schools, to authors with books, to screenwriters collaborating on a spec script. It would be a city where people understand one anotherâ€”their neighbors, the people groups that might be defined as â€œother,â€ and themselves. It would be a city where there is a vibrant economy with jobs and healthy incomes for allâ€”and that the creative economy of storytellers would be the engine that drives this growth. Success for us, in 2050, would be the realization of a Los Angeles that is even more itself, that is home to the kind of culture that cannot be found anywhere else, of a Los Angeles where you would want to live, work, and create."
3102002,2013002,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/826LA.html,1000 Mentors for Students: Build a Greater City of Angels with 826LA!, Education,"<p>Imagine Los Angeles in the year 2050 when we all play a part in educating our cityâ€™s youngest citizens. Volunteering is as common as going to the gym. Adults feel fulfilled because they are connecting with others. School children are thriving because they have a community of role models who serve as mentors. Los Angeles is flourishing because everyone lends a hand.</p>





<p>In this vision of Los Angeles, education reaches beyond the classroom. Children have a wealth of teachers because adults volunteer a few hours of their time each week. With so many caring adults cheering them on, students are more focused and excited to learn.</p>





<p>To make our vision of L.A. in 2050 a reality, 826LA will inspire over 1,000 Angelinos to make volunteering part of their lives in 2013. By sharing their talents and their time, these volunteers will help students across Los Angeles to make great leaps in learning. Studies show that students who receive oneonone attention from adults improve their academic outcomes, behavior, and selfesteem. All of these attributes are crucial for the future parents, workers, and leaders of our city.</p>





<p>This idea will not only improve the existing problems in Los Angelesâ€™ education system, it will encourage a culture of compassion in our city. As volunteer Kelly told 826LA, â€œIt feels good to give yourself to something else.â€ By sharing their experiences with their friends and families, these 1,000 volunteers will encourage even more people to volunteer to lead a workshop, to coach a soccer game, or to help a child with their homework. Pretty soon, everyone in L.A. will be doing it, and weâ€™ll all be the better for it, too.  </p>","<p>Since opening our doors in 2005, 826LA has served more than 30,000 students from across Los Angeles County. Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000 volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This new Mar Vista center increases 826LAâ€™s capacity significantly, providing 2,625 squarefeet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30% more students each day through AfterSchool Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>





<p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last yeara 23% increase from the previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LAâ€™s programs build selfesteem, teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>





<p> 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>


<p> 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>


<p> 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during an 826LA workshop;</p>


<p> 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving tutoring at 826LA.</p>





<p>Other notable achievements include:</p>


<p>â€¢ In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LAâ€™s dedication to the community;</p>


<p>â€¢ 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Supervisor Eric Garcetti for our work in the Echo Park community in March 2010;</p>


<p>â€¢ 826LA was named a â€œNonprofit to Followâ€ by Philanthropy magazine in 2012;</p>


<p>â€¢ On April 9, 2013, 826LA will be honored during the Mayors Day of Recognition for National Service at City Hall by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for our work with the Corporation for National and Community Service and Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA). </p><p>Thanks in part to recruitment, training, and retention practices strengthened by AmeriCorps VISTA members, hours contributed by volunteers at 826LA increased by 40% last year!</p>","826LA will collaborate with AmeriCorps VISTA; local colleges and universities including Cal State LA, Cal State Northridge, USC, and UCLA; and its volunteer corps of over 3,000 individuals in order to successfully implement this project. To recruit volunteers, 826LA will collaborate with LA Works as part of their California Volunteers Service Enterprise Initiative.","To evaluate this project, 826LA will measure its success towards reaching the following goals:





1) Recruit, register, and train at least 1,000 volunteer mentors in 2013;


2) Share volunteer stories through 826LA's website, blog, events, and external communications in order to promote volunteering in Los Angeles;


3) A minimum of 85% of students participating in 826LAâ€™s inschool programs will report that the adults they worked with cared about their success in school.


","Los Angeles students attend some of the most overcrowded schools in the United States. With so many students in their classrooms, teachers are unable to offer the oneonone time that is crucial for young people. 826LA seeks to give students the individual attention they need to become effective learners, confident leaders, and engaged citizens. 826LAâ€™s project will do this by inspiring over 1,000 citizens to get involved in our community and mentor local students. Even a few hours of volunteer time can have a huge impact on a child: studies show that with 3540 hours of tutoring, a student can increase his or her reading by an entire grade level!





Beyond the educational boon to students, this project will benefit the whole city by encouraging a culture of compassion. The impact of helping others is significant: studies show that volunteering reduces stress and alleviates depression. The impact of receiving help can be transformative, too. Students will grow up knowing that they are an important part of a community that cares about them. Volunteers become mentors to the children they work with, and, by modeling good citizenship, they will teach children that giving back is just part of what we do in Los Angeles. 





Our vision of a connected future starts today. The more we volunteer in 2013, the more we perpetuate this cycle of giving. And by 2050, todayâ€™s students will become tomorrowâ€™s mentors for a new generation of Angelinos. 


","<p>If 826LA is successful in shaping the future of the city, every student in Los Angeles will receive the oneonone help they need to succeed. Individual attention helps students build leadership skills that are essential for 21st century life, including focus, strong communication, decisiveness, selfrespect, and compassion. Volunteers will make it possible for every student to receive individual attention regardless of their socioeconomic status. Talent, experience, and kindness abound in the City of Angels, and by volunteering just a few hours a week, Angelinos can share this wealth with young people. </p>





<p>Itâ€™s projected that there will be more than 39 million people in Los Angeles County in 2050â€”thatâ€™s a lot of volunteers! By making volunteering part of our lives, we will give our students a diverse group of role models. Students will have opportunities to explore filmmaking from film professionals; to visit science labs; to discover other cultures; and to practice their Englishlanguage skills with their neighbors.</p> 





<p>By 2050, citywide volunteering will create a more united Los Angeles. Generous adults not only provide the oneonone attention that students need, but also show them that they are part of a community that cares. Itâ€™s important that young people find the inspiration and guidance that they are seeking; and see first hand what the work of volunteers can do for others, and ultimately, for themselves. As 826LA volunteer Vicente explains:</p>





<p>""I [volunteer] because I can relate to the students. I grew up this way. I struggled with English writing and English speaking. I know the importance of receiving positive reinforcement, and that's what students get when they come to 826LA. I volunteer because my heart is in helping students."" </p>





<p>By giving our attention and volunteering our time, everyone will contribute to the education of our children in 2050. Our studentsâ€”and all of Los Angelesâ€”will benefit from this culturally rich, engaged, and united city. </p>"
3102003,2013003,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/NEVERBUILT.html,Never Built: Los Angeles,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p> Never Built Los Angeles is a rare and unprecedented exhibition:  A gripping collection of civic projects that never came to be yet teach us new ways to think about the cityâ€™s future.  <p/>





<p> The show assembles for the first time original drawings, new and old models, large scale installations, videos, and interactive media to portray visionary works that had the potential to reshape Los Angeles. From buildings and civic plans, to parks and freeways, the show reveals exquisite ideas and the dreams behind them.  No other show, focusing on this unique and unexplored history of Los Angeles, has ever before been mounted.  <p/>





<p> On public view for the first time will be such sweeping proposals as the Olmsted and Bartholomew â€œPlan for the Los Angeles Region,â€ which if it had happened would have turned the entire coastline of Los Angeles into a public park, and crisscrossed the basin with thousands of acres of new parks and landscaped parkways.  Never before on display will be Frank Lloyd Wrightâ€™s handdrawn images of his â€œDoheny Ranch,â€ which would have turned the slopes of Beverly Hills into a collection of oneofakind Wright houses clustered in a landscape of dramatic terraces and ravines.  Visionary architect John Lautnerâ€™s Griffith Park Nature Center,  also buried for decades in an archive, will be among the more than 30 groundbreaking works never built and almost never seen. <p/>





<p> Great cities rise around these kinds of ambitions, usually written in sticks and stone, and steel and glass. Then there is Los Angeles, always the exception. The city is a mecca for architects, home to two Pritzker Prize winners (Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne) and a roll call of modern architectureâ€™s most famous talents. The entertainment hub of the United States, if not the world, it is a magnet for ingenuity, individuality, and imaginative ideas. Yet Los Angeles largely lacks the grand gestures of urban innovation. The gap between Los Angelesâ€™s genius for design and its public output is what Never Built Los Angeles hopes to span.  The exhibit is a lesson plan, based on a 100year backlog of unbuilt proposals.  By putting on view a catalogue of virtuoso drawings and renderings that, on a visceral level ignite the imagination, an unmistakable picture of a city that might have been â€“ and still could be â€“ emerges. Never Built treats this hidden past as something not complete but still unfolding. So, this is less an exhibition than a way of seeing the future of Los Angeles. <p/>





<p> Typically architecture exhibitions explore the subject from a very narrow perspective; an academic and aesthetic exercise catered largely toward experts in the field. Our show is meant to demonstrate the relevance of the built environment to every citizen of our city and well beyond. It begins with anyone who is interested in Los Angeles, in the turbulent arc of urban development, and in the widest possibilities of the imagination. The projects will have a far reaching appeal to anyone who cares about Los Angeles and who has ever dreamed of something different: from a floating airport to giant skyscrapers to massive swaths of connected parkland. <p/>





<p> The show and its accompanying book will become standards for the deeper study and understanding of Los Angeles. Not just for academics and architects, but for students and tourists and urban dwellers. The audience isn't just a local one, it's both national and international, not only because of the ingenious, alluring proposals, but because Los Angelesa cultural nexus that defies all the rules of urban placemaking never fails to capture peoples' imaginations. <p/>","<p> The A+D Architecture and Design Museum > Los Angeles was founded in 2001. A+D is the only cultural institution in the United States showcasing continuous programs on architecture and design. Through exhibits, symposia, multidisciplinary projects, educational and community programming, A+D is a showcase for the work of important regional, national and international designers, providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism, and design. <p/>





<p> A+D has collaborated with important institutions such as the The Getty Center, AIA, SCIArc, the LA Forum as well as emerging and established architects. The museum has produced over 30 world class exhibits and received Awards of Merit for education programming from The American Architectural Foundation. It's also received multiyear grants from the Department of Cultural Affairs; explored the frontiers of design through concerts incorporating cutting edge computer graphics and electronic sound; and hosted panels moderated by a diverse group including L.A. Times Architecture Critic Christopher Hawthorne, City Planner Gail Goldberg, journalist Frances Anderton, actor/pundit Harry Shearer and Councilman Bernard Parks. <p/>





<p> A+D has been awarded back to back grants from the Getty Foundation for Pacific Standard Time (2011) and Pacfiic Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. (2012).  For PST, the museum presented â€œEames Words,â€ an exhibition that highlighted the ideas, rather than the creations, of the pioneering designers Charles and Ray Eames.  For Pacific Standard Time Presents, the upcoming 2013 show, the museum has created â€œWindshield Perspective,â€ an examination of the Los Angeles urban landscape as seen through the cityâ€™s unexplored and unrepresented boulevards. <p/>





<p> A+D hosts exhibit openings and events that are wellattended and garner attention and good will.  These events are an integral part of the Museumâ€™s purpose: comprehensive programming that incorporates academic and professional development with public outreach that is social and educational: Exhibitions of progressive architecture and design; topical lectures and seminars; student and professional design charrettes; education programs; architecture, design, urban tours; film screenings; book launches; internship opportunities; collaborations with community foundations focusing on atrisk youth; collaborations with cultural and educational institutions, locally and worldwide. <p/>


","<p> Exhibition collaborators: Clive Wilkinson Architects, All Coast Construction, Olson Visual, LUNA Graphics, Shimahara Illustration, Buro Happold, Machineous, The Model Shop, The Lapis Press, Metropolis Books. <p/>





<p> Participating institutions: UCLA, USC, UCSB, Getty Research Institute, SCIArc, LAX Flight Path Learning Center, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Library & Archive, Huntington Library. <p/>





<p> Exhibition Partners: City of Los Angeles, American Institute of Architects/LA, American Planning Association, California Historical Society. <p/>


","<p> There are a number of keys to the success of Never Built.  Museum attendance will be one yardstick, of course. We're hoping that a huge amount of people come to the show and get inspired to change the city around them. We're also hoping that it's a very diverse audience: from children to the elderly, and along every line of race and class. <p/>





<p> We hope the show's themes will spread far beyond those coming to the show. Never Built has already begun to achieve that, garnering considerable press  from Australian radio to Forbes to KCET.  By putting the images of past ideas out for a global audience to see, Never Built has already fired peoples' imaginations. To further promote our message, we're organizing a number of forums  together with USC, the California Historical Association, the American Institute of Architects, and The American Planning Associationâ€”assuring that the question of how Los Angeles can imaginatively tackle its pressing urban needs, will become front and center in the public discourse. <p/>


 


<p> The final metric of success is seeing the culture in the city actually change. That too is already starting to happen. The American Institute of Architects now uses the exhibit as a case study for why the city needs to be more invested in design, and people every day tell us how they're inspired by the show to make sure the next round of visionary projects in the city don't become Never Built. <p/>


","<p> The stories surrounding these projects reveal a reluctant city whose institutions and infrastructureâ€”from a fractured power base to riskaverse developers to reluctant neighbors â€”have often undermined visionary work. Our goal is to change this culture, shedding light on the city's many missed opportunities so that visionary, creative, innovative ideas in the largescale pubic realm will once again be embraced here. Furthermore, much of Los Angeles is ugly and poorly planned. Another aim is to end the complacency about this fact. We want to connect the inherent appeal of unrealized designs to the daily experience of the built world. We want people in Los Angeles and elsewhere to regard beauty and livability as essential rights in their lives. <p/>


","<p> Success in 2050 would be a city with a culture that embraces innovation and a public realm that is equal in accomlishment to its private one.  The areas that Never Built highlights â€“ such as mass transit, park space, river restoration, the city skyline, civic buildings â€“ will have become wellplanned rather than mere afterthoughts.  For example, the city would have efficient, effective mass transit, with stations that are magnificently designed.  A nondescription locale like the Cornfields, just north of downtown, would have been long ago made over into a thriving parkland accessible to all of the cityâ€™s residents. Stunning and effectively planned public buildings would be designed by a broad crosssection of the talented architects in the city, not just by large, wellconnected firms. <p/>





<p> The cityâ€™s bureaucracy would have embraced the bold and the adventurous instead of continually deepsixing them in a mountain of doubt, redtape, footdragging, or worse, disdain.  The cityâ€™s political apparatus, as well, would have been reformed sufficiently to promote the best in city planning and civic design, rather than remain almost powerless to achieve these aims, as it is today.  Developersâ€™ and citizensâ€™ attitudes, too, would have changed to embrace the essential importance of design in building a better, more livable and thrilling city.<p/>"
3102004,2013004,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/AccessJustice.html,Advancing Justice through Legal Social Enterprises, Income & Employment,"ADVANCE builds a â€œTeach for Americaâ€ for legal reform that produces socially responsible lawyers committed to restoring justice and access to legal services. 





An experiential training program to transform how attorneys practice law in L.A., CA, ADVANCE helps millions gain unprecedented access to legal services and lawyers build satisfying careers committed to justice. We train law graduates to become socially responsible attorneys who:





1) deliver legal services through a social enterprise model;


2) make positive changes to a lawyerâ€™s work-life balance; and


3) restore integrity, trust, and access in the justice system for all.





**The Problem**





The outdated practice of law is a major cause of social problems. The justice gap between low to moderate income people and legal services is widespread, and grows as courts and legal nonprofits face budget cuts. In L.A., half of its 10 million residents come to court without a lawyer.  Meanwhile, new law grads remain unemployed or enter a dissatisfying profession that is reluctant to help advance legal access.





Currently, legal self-help, nonprofit, and pro bono services have failed to close the justice gap. Public Counsel, Equal Justice Works, Legal Aid, and justice corps provide direct legal services to the poor but lack sustaining forms of revenue and fail to serve a large percentage of the population. Solo practice incubators train lawyers in traditional forms of law practice that ignore social enterprise values. Others, such as DOJâ€™s Access to Justice, are vulnerable to budget cuts and struggle to attract probono lawyers. Likewise, traditional firms only promote probono assistance and social responsibility as an aside.





**ADVANCE--The Solution**





Our model is the first legal training program that equips lawyers to build careers committed to closing the justice gap and approaches the legal practice as a social enterprise. Based on Harvardâ€™s shared value concept, it dismantles the old law firm model and returns lawyers to the business of service and addressing societal needs and challenges.  In the end, ADVANCE not only helps to solve the justice gap by providing access to legal services for the majority of Angelenos, it also helps provide jobs for the nearly 50% of unemployed law school graduates who want to help their community but have no means to do so.  In addition, by addressing these two issues facing the legal system, ADVANCE will help alleviate the overcrowding and lack of resources facing Los Angeles court systems.





**The Idea**





A hybrid that places social responsibility at the core of legal services, we create a social enterprise law firm model that trains lawyers to provide affordable and innovative legal services to low and moderate income people. 





Consisting of a B corp law firm and training program, new law graduates will enter a 2-year, salaried position to learn how to practice law that advances social responsibility, healing and restored justice. The program includes: trainings; workshops; leadership courses; law practice management courses; mentoring and coaching; online resources; and the creation of easy-access legal â€œminute clinicsâ€ at locations convenient to target populations. At the end, trainees will be equipped to offer holistic legal services in restorative justice, collaborative law, conflict resolution, mediation, and civil and criminal law. Trainees will also learn how to start and manage a law firm that reconnects legal business success with social progress.





Having access to legal representation should never be limited to the rich.   Angelenos with low or moderate incomes, or who are unemployed, equally deserve legal representation.  ADVANCE delivers justice for this population that has long been left behind.  With ADVANCE, the impossible begins to become possible --  a model for justice provided to all.  


","ADVANCE is still in its idea stages; however, as mentioned, we have been selected as a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which would fund our organization for the next two years.  In addition, one of the organization's founders has seen how her work as a lawyer and social entrepreneur implementing a law firm model identical to ADVANCE's has made positive and lasting changes to low and moderate income people navigating the justice system in L.A. But her experience has been met with challenges when trying to address the needs of a large population. This led her to see potential in creating a training program so legal professionals like her can help people the law is meant to serve.





","We plan to work with private and public nonprofits, such as the CA Bar, American Bar Association, Department of Justice, Pro Bono Institute, Taproot Foundation and Public Interest Law Foundation, to garner support for our idea.  In addition, we are collaborating with legal experts, scholars, and entrepreneurs across the U.S. that are committed to solving the problems ADVANCE addresses and that promote innovative legal practices such as integrative law and holistic law.    Lastly, ADVANCE is a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which  has provided more than $31 million in start-up funding to leaders in a variety of sectors to implement bold ideas aimed at affecting social change. ","In the first year, we will train 3 new law graduates and serve 500 clients. By year 5, we plan to have 50 socially responsible lawyers graduate from our training program, with 30,000 people served annually.





We also plan to recruit 5 law experts each year for five years to staff the training program. By year 5, we plan to provide training, coaching and mentoring in 6 legal areas: bankruptcy, immigration, consumer law, family law, business law, and civil defense.





Our impact will be measured annually by:





1) # of people served;


2) # of social enterprise law firms launched by alumni of our training program;


3) % reduction of self-represented litigants in the justice system; and


4) data recording clientsâ€™ changing attitudes towards the legal system and attorneys.





In 10 years, we hope to:





1) assist 45% of the 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court;





2) create 40% of the legal jobs for new law graduates;





3) reduce by 30% the number of cases clogging the court system; and





4) increase by 50% the level of job satisfaction and work-life balance among lawyers.","ADVANCE will serve as a vanguard for the legal profession: inspiring, training, and producing cutting-edge, socially responsible lawyers committed to closing the justice gap in Los Angeles.  We help deliver affordable legal services to millions of people, and empower law graduates to become social entrepreneurs and practice law centered in restoring justice.  





We focus on three groups affected by the justice system: 1) recent law school graduates; 2) low and moderate income people; and 3) local court systems.  





In 10 years, we hope to build a revolution in law that:





1) assists 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court;





2) creates a majority of legal jobs for new law graduates;





3) reduces the number of cases clogging the court system; 





and





4) increases the level of job satisfaction and work-life balance among lawyers.","Looking back at our measurables, in 2050, we hope that every woman and man in Los Angeles will have a lawyer, no matter their social or economic backgrounds.  Access to justice will no longer be a luxury.  100% of the 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court will have legal representation, provided to them by new law graduates who will be equipped and able to serve their community.  The court systems will no longer face overcrowding and case overload issues.  And lawyers will return to the role they were meant to serve -- stewards of justice."
3102005,2013005,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SafeStreetsinWatts.html,Advancement Project: Safe Streets for Watts Students, Public Safety,"<p>Advancement Projectâ€™s Urban Peace program believes that all children have the right to walk to and from school without the fear of gang intimidation or violence. However, in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, families and students are fearful to travel outside of their homes to attend school, play in the local parks, and frequent neighborhood stores. Children living in public housing developments are unable walk to and from school safely because of harassment and intimidation by competing gangs who are actively recruiting in and near schools. Local parks and gyms are usually unsafe and often claimed by local gangs, so some of the few recreational spaces for lowincome families to engage in physical activity are not being utilized.  Urban Peaceâ€™s Community Safety Scorecard: City of Los Angeles 2011 reveals that the Watts community ranks as one of the top 10 most dangerous zip codes in Los Angeles with an â€œFâ€ ranking for safety. </p>


<p>Thankfully, Urban Peace is now turning the tide in Watts, creating a safe environment for children to walk to school, ride their bikes, and for families to visit local parks. Our Safe Routes to School initiative will use innovative strategies to reduce crime, violence, and bullying along popular school travel routes.  This initiative will unite community member volunteers, educators, local law enforcement officials and public housing officials to ensure that students can walk safely to school.  The goal of our Safe Routes to School effort will be that students and families will be safe traveling to school, in school, and home from school.</p>


<p>Through Safe Routes to School, our initiative will reduce chronic absenteeism that results from safety concerns and improve student access to safe after school alternatives.  As part of Urban Peaceâ€™s comprehensive violence reduction strategy in Watts, the Safe Routes to School initiative will build on Urban Peaceâ€™s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership, a historic joint effort that has created unprecedented partnerships between public housing officials, law enforcement officers, and community members around a comprehensive violence reduction strategy.</p>


<p>Our efforts will directly improve student safety, as well as increase opportunities for children and families to safely travel through their neighborhood.  Take Blanca, a gifted science student living in Watts public housing who hopes to become a doctor one day.  She has supportive parents and works diligently to complete her homework each night.  However, as soon as she steps out of her front door to travel to school, she remembers the gang shootings she witnessed last year on her block.  Many of her friends suffer PTSD symptoms from witnessing chronic violence.</p>


<p>Blanca is halfway through eighth grade, and she is already intimidated by the gang members that try to recruit her at the park, and is even more fearful to face them on a daily basis on her walk to school.  The school Blanca needs to pursue her dreams seems simply too risky and too dangerous for her to attend.  However, the Safe Routes to School initiative envisions eliminating the fear and intimidation that students like Blanca, and 3,000 like her in Watts face.</p>


<p>When the Safe Routes to School initiative is implemented during the 201314 school year, Blancaâ€™s walk to school will be transformed. Instead of having to avoid gang violence, Blanca will see a friendly neighborhood mother asking her how her test went last week.  On a corner that she was once too afraid to cross, Blanca will instead pass a familiar police officer working with a trusted community gang intervention worker, both working to ensure students' safety.</p>  


<p>Upon arriving at school, Blanca will be greeted by a trained teacher and gang intervention worker who have taught her strategies to avoid joining a gang and encouraged her to pursue her dreams to become a doctor. Her teachers will have received violence prevention training and will listen and respond to her campus safety concerns including bullying and intimidation from her peers with appropriate and timely interventions. Because of the support of so many community members, Blanca will now have the confidence to stay after school to attend a study group and her family will feel safe when playing a soccer game at a local park in the evening.</p>


<p>As a result of our efforts, children like Blanca will not only have the freedom to attend and succeed in school without fears of gang intimidation and violence, but the entire safety of their community will also be improved.  Leveraging our ongoing efforts to improve community safety through our leadership of the Watts Community Safety Partnership, we are confident that the integration of a Safe Routes to School initiative will reduce violent crimes to historically low levels in the Watts community and create safe public spaces for Watts families to engage in physical activities.</p>","<p>As a result of Urban Peaceâ€™s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership in Watts, violent crime has dropped by 53% to 75% within each of the three Watts housing developments over that past year.  Law enforcement officials are thrilled by the reduced crime statistics, citing that there has not been a single homicide in the Watts housing developments since August 2011.  Community members have reported that residents are now feeling more safe to travel and frequent stores within their community, and there have been notable decreases in youth gang membership and activity.  While we are proud of our work in Watts, the Urban Peace program has also had a profound effect in improving community safety throughout Los Angeles.</p>





<p>Over the past 12 years, Urban Peace has established unprecedented partnerships between gang intervention workers and law enforcement throughout Los Angeles, resulting in the lowest crime rates since the 1960â€™s. Since 2006, gang related crimes have been reduced by 32% and the number of shots fired within Los Angles has decreased from 3,288 to 1,723, representing a 52% reduction.  Overall, the crime rate is at a historical low in both the City and the County of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck credits Urban Peaceâ€™s work with contributing to this historic decline.  Former LAPD Chief William Bratton hails our success: â€œThe Advancement Project has been a force of nature. They have changed the way things are done in Los Angeles on gangs.â€  </p>





<p>Similarly, Advancement Projectâ€™s Urban Peace Academy, the only publicly supported training program for gang intervention workers, has trained over 1,200 violence intervention workers and 500 police officers to work together towards violence reduction. Recently, our training of community intervention workers that operate the Los Angeles Summer Night Lights program contributed to a 35% drop in gang related homicides last summer in and around the parks where the program operates.  Similarly, throughout Los Angelesâ€™ GRYD zones, where our Urban Peace Academy law enforcement and gang intervention graduates operate,  there has been a 30% reduction in gang related crime and 42% reduction in shots fired.  As crime rates continue to drop, the Urban Peace program is gaining national attention and requests for our innovative technical assistance have come from Seattle, Memphis, and Sacramento.</p>","Urban Peace will work with a variety of public and private stakeholders to implement the Safe Routes to School initiative over the next year.  These partners include the LAPD and HACLA, as well as the City of Los Angeles Office of Gang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD).  In addition, we will engage community stakeholders who will act as volunteers to monitor crime hotspots at peak school arrival and dismissal times, train gang intervention workers to assist in our efforts, and partner with local schools to help implement violence prevention strategies.","<p>The goal of our Safe Routes to School initiative is to improve community safety so that more students are walking to school safely and families can access public spaces for physical activity.  Urban Peace will actively collect and analyze data throughout our Safe Routes to School initiative to determine its impact on increasing safety within the Watts community over a five year period.  We believe success will be demonstrated through decreased levels of gang violence, as well as an increase in the number of students attending school, and families engaging in physical activity.  </p>





<p>To measure our effect in decreasing violence, we will leverage our long standing relationship with the LAPD to access their crime statistics and analyze our progress annually.  We will also collect school attendance and truancy data from local schools to see if our Safe Routes to School strategy is increasing the number of students walking and biking to school, as well as decreasing the number of students missing school because of gang activity they have experienced when traveling to school.</p>","Advancement Projectâ€™s Safe Routes to School initiative will greatly benefit the Los Angeles community by increasing public safety in one the cityâ€™s most violent and poor neighborhoods. We expect that our Safe Routes to School initiative will not only lead to increased student safety in and around schools, but also increased school attendance and decreased dropout rates over five years. Our Safe Routes to School effort will compliment Urban Peaceâ€™s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership in Watts, where we provide technical assistance to the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) and the LAPD to implement a historic and joint community safety plan.  








Through the Community Safety Partnership, Urban Peace has instructed 45 LAPD law enforcement officers stationed in Watts for five years to implement community policing best practices.  We have also trained 15 emerging Latino residents to become leaders of this community safety effort. The Urban Peace Academy is also training a cadre of community intervention and Safe Routes to School workers in Spring and Fall 2013 as part of the City of Los Angeles Office of Gang Reduction and Youth Developmentâ€™s regional strategy.  








After just one year after our leadership of the Community Safety Partnership, the results of our efforts have been nothing short of extraordinary, with violent crime rates in Watts at the lowest levels in recent history.  Because our Community Safety Partnership will act as a foundation for our Safe Routes to School initiative, we are confident that our efforts will have a profound effect on not only improving safety in and around schools, but also in improving overall community safety and health.  When residents feel safe enough to travel in their community, we expect that Watts youth and families will engage in increased physical activity by walking and biking to school, leading to increased school attendance, as well as lowered obesity and diabetes rates.


","<p>In 2050, Urban Peace envisions that Los Angeles has evolved from the gang capital of the country to one of the nationâ€™s safest large cities. We believe Watts can become as safe of a neighborhood as Bel Air.  While this future may seem like an unrealistic goal, we believe that if law enforcement and community members continue to work in partnership to implement a comprehensive violence reduction strategy, gang violence can be eradicated even in Los Angelesâ€™ poorest communities.  Our hope is all residents, regardless of income level or the socioeconomic status of their neighborhood, feel safe from violence and crime.  </p>





<p>We also believe that our efforts to successfully transform the Watts community and implement a Safe Routes to School initiative within an urban neighborhood will eventually act as a model for other Los Angeles communities seeking to increase the number children walking to school.  Using our evaluation tools, we will uplift the lessons learned from our initiative to demonstrate how multisector partners can work together effectively to improve safety levels, as well as encourage families to walk and bicycle to neighborhood schools and parks.  By expanding our successful community violence reduction strategy   and Safe Routes to School model throughout Los Angeles, we hope to ensure that all communities have the health, safety, and opportunity they need to thrive.</p>"
3102006,2013006,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SharedHousing.html,Shared Housing Helps Los Angeles Become a National Model!, Housing,"In addition to rising healthcare costs and lower public benefits for vulnerable populations, the most taxing cost burden on older adults is housing.  Today, approximately 13 million older Americas cannot afford their housing costs. Many are forced to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and buying groceries or medicine.  





In response, ALA is leading a national effort to expand its shared housing program so that all individuals in need have access to safe and supportive housing options as they age.  Although particularly beneficial for seniors on fixed incomes and those risking isolation, the shared housing movement goes beyond addressing the needs of any single user group.  Shared housing provides opportunities for anyone interested in fostering social connections and remaining integrated in their community while accessing affordable housing.  When a program is delivered by an experienced housing or social service agency, the model is also well suited for supporting veterans, single mothers and other vulnerable individuals. 





Shared housing is a simple idea. One individual, typically a homeowner, offers accommodation to another in exchange for rent, help around the house or light caregiving support.  Home â€œshareesâ€ have access to a blend of private and communal space.  Even when the primary motivation for sharing is financial, many individuals enjoy the added benefits of companionship and shared responsibilities that come with cooperative living.





ALA is positioned to build upon our four decades of experience to scale our shared housing program for the benefit of more individuals and entire communities.  To attract a wider audience of home sharers, ALA will create a compelling and engaging viral and social media campaign that emphasizes the benefits of shared housing.  The campaign will stimulate interest among potential sharers and spark conversations about how communities can use shared housing to achieve their affordable housing goals.   





ALA staff, in partnership with the Enterprise Community Foundation, will continue to train and educate other agencies who will help support the increased demand for services.


","In the 35 years since ALA was founded, we have helped more than 30,000 seniors in their search for safe, stable housing that preserves their dignity and independence and keeps them engaged in their communities.  





Our most significant achievement to date is partnering with the National Shared Housing Resource Center to lead the revival of the shared housing movement by rebuilding the Centerâ€™s capacity and launching a national campaign to strengthen existing programs. 





Through a collaborative sixmonth process ALA worked with stakeholders from around the country to develop the Strategic Guide on Scaling Shared Housing, which highlights the exciting work happening in the field and identifies the new opportunities for growth. For example, New York City used shared housing as a disaster response solution in the wake of super storm Sandy.  





With the support of Enterprise Community Partners and the Archstone Foundation, ALA hosted a Shared Housing Symposium that convened leaders from Illinois, Vermont, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Michigan and California to launch the Strategic Guide and discuss ideas for reinvigorating this decadesold movement.

The National Shared Housing Resource Center wrote about ALA's Shared Housing Symposium here:


http://nationalsharedhousing.org/sharedhousingsymposiuminlosangeles/","ALA will enlist the participation of organizations like SHARE!, New Directions, and CoAbode, as well as other housing coalitions interested in offering shared housing services in their communities and participating in the public education campaign.  





ALAâ€™s award winning board member, Renee Fraser of Fraser Communications, will work with ALA and its partners to create a compelling and impactful communications strategy.  With Fraser Communicationsâ€™ expertise, for every dollar ALA spends, we will get an extra dollar or more of media for free. 





At the national level, ALA works closely with the National Shared Housing Resource Center, which has the infrastructure necessary to spread lessons learned in LA to a network of programs.  


","The project will measure success using client metrics and social engagement.  ALA and its partners will track outputs such as unique visits to agency websites and the volume of calls before, during and after initiation of the project.  To evaluate increased awareness and a shift in attitude toward shared housing, ALA will use the number of new program enrollees as a measureable outcome.  Engagement metrics will measure the means by which the message is reaching a broader audience (social media, public relations activity, advertising or other).  Measures will also look at the quantity and profile of individuals who are responding to shared housing campaignrelated content.","LAâ€™s future as a thriving metropolis relies on providing a housing supply that supports individual stability, keeps people connected to the places where they live, and makes communities more vibrant, diverse and supportive.   Shared housing does this by capturing the inventory of available units, rather than relying solely on the production of new units.  





A staggering 73% of lowincome homeowners and 93% of lowincome renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing. By pursuing shared housing as a strategy to address affordability challenges, the project will close the gap between inadequate income and the high cost of housing.  In 2012, individuals enrolled in ALAâ€™s shared housing program reduced their rents costs by an average of 50%.





Moreover, Los Angeles sets trends for the rest of the nation.  With a strong shared housing program, we have the opportunity to become a national model for integration  rather than marginalization  of vulnerable populations.


","Safe, affordable, emotionally uplifting homes are the cornerstone of a strong community. By 2050, Los Angeles has the potential to become a thriving network of neighborhoods where people can access a variety of housing types that match their current situation.  Success would also include widespread understanding of the benefits of shared living as a way to meet peopleâ€™s unique needs at every stage of their life.  





Societyâ€™s notion of housing and independence is closely associated with privacy and security.  Increased adoption of shared housing faces real and perceived boundaries.  Success is dependent upon effectively training other agencies to deliver quality shared housing services, which will help counter negative misconceptions about shared housing.  





The Shared Housing campaign will help inspire interest and participation in the flexibility and benefits of home sharing while at the same time encouraging individuals and communities to become more compassionate towards and supportive of the vulnerable populations among us.

3102007,2013007,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BLAST.html,Alliance CollegeReady Public Schools  BLAST, Education,"When Alliance CollegeReady Public Schools (Alliance) was founded, we set out to prove that it is possible to run a system of highperforming public schools that consistently prepares all students for success in college.  Our intention is to serve as a model for other public schools and districts and to significantly increase access to a highquality education that prepares all students for success in college and life regardless of their background or where they live.  Today Alliance operates 21 highperforming public charter middle and high schools, educating 9,500 lowincome from Los Angelesâ€™ most underserved neighborhoods.   Since our founding, 95% of Alliance graduates have gone to college.   





Despite our success, Alliance recognizes that we are making the best of an antiquated model.  While technology has changed our world profoundly, K12 public schools remain largely untouched by the technological revolution outside the classroom.  Classes are still structured largely on the late 19th century industrial model where students learn to read, write, calculate, and memorize in preparation for a factorylike environment.  Learning is largely passive, with one curriculum directed at all students regardless of individual student comprehension and achievement levels.  When students reach college, most of their education is facilitated by technology. They are expected to work with technology in a selfdirected manner and solve complex problems using a variety of sources and strategies.  When they reach the workforce, those expectations only increase.   





By integrating technology into the Alliance's already successful curriculum, Alliance developed the Blended Learning for Alliance School Transformation (BLAST) model to increase student academic achievement, increase personalization and relevancy in student learning, and provide students with 21st century learning tools.  In BLAST classrooms, students receive a laptop and rotate through learning stations in small groups during twohour blocks for core academic subjects.  Learning stations include 1) teacher lead instruction with no more than 16 students at one time 2) individualized, interactive online instruction with content that adapts to and accelerates based on each studentâ€™s level of proficiency, and 3) structured, collaborative projects in which students use technology to solve realworld problems.  This unique rotational model provides a highly personalized environment that maximizes student time with teachers; empowers students to master content at their own pace; provides realtime data that gives teachers and students immediate feedback and allows students to monitor their own progress; and enables students to delve into projects that stimulate critical thinking.  In addition, through distance learning classes, students are able to benefit from lessons with the best teachers within and outside of Allianceâ€™s network, and take online, interactive electives not offered at their home school.  BLAST schools use supplemental digital content aligned to state and common core standards, which allows students to fill gaps in past learning, or accelerate ahead of their peers if they are ready.  The highly individualized nature of the model assures that no student is left behind and no student is held back.





Originally piloted in fall 2010 at two Alliance high schools in South LA and Watts, the BLAST model has grown to serve 3,750 students at four Alliance high schools and three middle schools.  Alliance plans to grow and strengthen this program over the next five years, opening all new Alliance schools with the BLAST model. 





Alliance has created a professional development program to provide teachers and principals the support they need to become highly effective educators in BLAST schools.  A Summer Institute provides indepth training for new BLAST principals and teachers and includes subjects such as the use of instructional technology, lesson planning in the rotational model, and how to use realtime data to strengthen instruction and classroom management.  In addition, teachers attend quarterly daylong BLAST teacher trainings and weekly planning meetings where they share best practices and solve problems. 





Built on the solid foundation of Allianceâ€™s rigorous collegepreparatory curriculum, BLAST schools significantly increase student ownership of their education and make learning far more personal, motivating, and relevant to the world in which they live, which will ultimately improve student academic performance, high school graduation rates, and college attendance and completion for thousands of students in Los Angeles.   


","Alliance CollegeReady Public Schools has grown to become the largest charter management organization operating in LAUSD, educating 9,500 lowincome students at 21 highperforming public middle and high schools.  If Alliance were a standalone district, we would be larger than 75% of the school districts in California.  Alliance has a consistent and exemplary track record of educating students at high levels.  More than 92% of incoming Alliance 9th graders graduate in four years (vs. 65% for LAUSD and 78% for the state).  One hundred percent of Alliance graduates pass the AG college prep courses required by California fouryear public universities and more than 95% of our graduates have gone to college.  Average daily attendance at Alliance schools is 95%.  Alliance schools consistently outperform neighboring schools on California achievement tests and four schools have been named California Distinguished Schools.  In the past six years, Alliancewide California Academic Performance Index (API) scores surpass those of neighborhood schools by nearly 100 points, LASUD by 62 points and the state by 18 points.  In 2012, six Alliance high schools were ranked in the top 3% of all high schools nationwide by U.S. News & World Report, and Alliance GertzRessler High School was the only school in LAUSD to be named a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.  By consistently achieving academic success across a network of 21 schools, Alliance proves that quality education does not have to be the exception; it can be the rule.  ","Alliance works with Education Elements, a key business partner in the development and refinement of BLAST and the professional development program for BLAST teachers and school leaders.  Alliance also works with online learning vendors to recommend improvement to learning software.  Other key partners include the Innosight Institute, NewSchools Venture Fundâ€™s College Achievement Network, the Broad Foundation, Computers for Youth, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation who will release an indepth evaluation on one of the early BLAST high schools in fall 2013.  Alliance also participates in a Professional Learning Community with blended learning school leaders from other charters and traditional public schools. ","Alliance will evaluate BLAST using a number of measures and methodology.  We measure student academic performance based on the percent of students scoring proficient or advanced on California State Standards Tests (and will continue to do so using the Common Core standards when California transitions to those standards in 2015).  We also look at the number of students graduating high school in four years, and attending and graduating from college.  Measures of college preparedness include number of students taking and passing AP classes, number of students passing the Cal State University Early Assessment Program, and performance on SAT and ACT college entrance exams.  To discern teacher, principal, and student satisfaction and identify areas for needed improvement in BLAST schools, we conduct regular surveys with faculty, students, and families.  We also partner with outside evaluators to provide objective thirdparty feedback on what is working and what needs to improve the BLAST model.  Specific key measures of success for each BLAST school are: 


â€¢	After three years, students in BLAST schools will match or


        surpass Alliancewide averages on state standardized tests. 


â€¢	After three years, BLAST schools will achieve a school ranking of 


        8 on the state Academic Performance Index (API) and surpass 


       Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) targets as mandated by the U.S.      


       Department of Education.  


â€¢	Ninetyfive percent of incoming 9th graders will graduate in four


        years. 


â€¢	Ninety percent of graduates will go to college. 


â€¢	Ninety percent of alumni will graduate from college in 6 years. 


â€¢	After four years, Alliance BLAST schools will be selfsustaining on 


        public funding.    


","With just the current BLAST schools, Alliance will provide a highquality, 21st century collegepreparatory education for more than 3,750 lowincome students annually in Los Angelesâ€™ most underserved communities.  Additionally, Alliance plans to grow the number of new BLAST schools by 10 over the next five years, ultimately educating 9,000 lowincome students in Los Angeles annually.   





Districtwide, LAUSD high schools graduate only 65% of their students and only 22% of those graduate with the required â€œAGâ€ college preparatory classes needed to attend a fouryear public university in California.  In contrast, Alliance schools graduate 92% of their students in four years and send 95% of graduates to college.  It is estimated that a high school graduate will earn nearly $400,000 more over his or her lifetime than a high school dropout, and a college graduate will earn nearly $1.6M more.  In addition, high school dropouts are eight times more likely to be incarcerated, 50% less likely to vote, and are underqualified for 90% of jobs.  Twothirds of dropouts will use public welfare benefits at some point in their lives.  The benefit to Los Angeles is the increased earnings and increased tax revenue generated for each Alliance high school and college graduate, and the savings from public assistance and incarceration costs.  Alliance BLAST graduates also increase the pool of potential employees, entrepreneurs, and business leaders in the digital economy that makes up an increasingly large piece of Los Angelesâ€™ economic growth.  As importantly, Alliance high school and college graduates provide community stability and civic involvement in their neighborhoods, city, and state.   





Beyond Alliance BLAST schools, our goal is to serve as a model for other schools and districts and to share our lessons and best practices,  therefore helping improve academic performance, high school graduation, and college completion rates for thousands more Los Angeles public school students outside the Alliance.   Allianceâ€™s early success with BLAST has drawn a significant level of interest from many in the broader public education community.  Alliance hosts regular observation visits at BLAST schools for school leaders, district officials, researchers, and policy makers, and Alliance staff are called on regularly to speak at education and policy conferences.  Alliance has also held preliminary discussions with two local university schools of education to discuss potential joint residency and teaching programs to prepare new teachers for the effective use of educational technology.  


","In 2050, 100% of students in Los Angeles would graduate from high school ready for college or meaningful employment.  All students, regardless of their parentsâ€™ income or where they live, would have access to highquality, public neighborhood schools that motivate students to be active learners and engaged participants in their own education.  All students would be college eligible, taking and passing necessary classes to attend a fouryear public university so that every student had the opportunity to attend college if they wanted to do so (and not have that choice decided for them through low expectations of their schools).  Seventyfive percent of students would go to college, and 100% of those would graduate.  Teachers in our public schools would be treated as highly esteemed, professional knowledgeworkers.  They would be recruited from the ranks of our highestperforming college students, provided consistent and relevant training and ongoing professional development, and compensated based on performance and at significantly higher levels.  Our public universities would again be the envy of the world and would be growing to meet the demands of the highlyeducated students graduating from Los Angeles and California high schools.  As a result, Los Angeles would be a national and international hub of economic growth and trade, entrepreneurship, and innovation.   "
3102008,2013008,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ABCParentEngagement.html,Padres Creando Exito: Effective educators in every classroom every school  , Education,"The Alliance for a Better Community (ABC) is proposing to elevate the public dialogue regarding equity and access to high quality instruction delivered by highly effective educators to all students in every classroom, every school. By partnering with the parents and families, students, teachers and administrators served by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), ABC will implement an education and awareness campaign, with a particular focus on media, to discuss and define the critical role parents and families must play in identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators.  





Public education in Los Angeles and California is fundamentally failing our children. For decades it has underserved and tracked students of color into separate academic and vocational programs, thereby perpetuating the inequities of race, gender and socioeconomic status in our society. ABC believes that in order for schools to provide the quality education children deserve and need, parents and families must serve as meaningful partners at the school and district levels. 





To increase student learning, excellent teachers are needed in every classroom. Research has found teachers to be the most important schoolrelated factor in student achievement.  According to a report on the LAUSD, the National Center on Teacher Quality found that, â€œof the 11,000 LAUSD teachers evaluated in the 20092010 school year, 79 percent met the standard in all 27 indicators, signaling that they did not need any improvement. Contrast teachersâ€™ apparent extraordinary level of performance with student performance: only 41% of students scored proficient on the state language arts exam and only 39% scored proficient in mathematics.â€ There are specific educational disparities that inequitably impact Latinos and African Americans in Los Angeles; one of those is the caliber of teachers in their classrooms. In a report by Education TrustWest, it was found that effective teachers are not equally distributed in LAUSD. Teachers in the top 25 percent are less likely to instruct lowerincome students of color. These teachers are also more likely to leave the district's highest need schools.  This is critically important since a teacher has more impact on student learning than any other factor controlled by school systems, including class size, school size, the quality of afterschool programs and even which school a student attends. Because a high percentage of a schoolâ€™s impact is attributable to teachers, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial achievement gains that are sustained over time. (Met Project, 2011). 





ABC is working collaboratively with its partners to advocate for policies and practices that identify, support and retain effective educators in highneed schools across LAUSD and integrate parents and families in the discussion and decisionmaking. Public dialogue around the topic has traditionally been led by District and union leaders and education pundits who are currently shaping how this issue is framed by the mainstream media and understood by those on the sideline watching the debate.  ABC is proposing to elevate the voices of those not typically heard, the: PARENTS and FAMILIES who have students in the District; STUDENTS who have been through the public school system and can testify to the impact that effective educators have had on their academic successes, and; TEACHERS in the classroom that understand the importance of the debate because they care about their students and families. ABC will launch a public education and awareness campaign, through the use of media, that elevates the critical role these stakeholders share in including the parents and families in the educator effectiveness dialogue to benefit student educational outcomes.  





Some of the key activities will include: convening at least 3 focus groups comprised of teachers, parents and students to discuss how parents and families can contribute to the development of policies and public conversations; developing at least 2 videos and 5 online profiles of parents, teachers and students providing testimonials about the importance of family voices in this public dialogue; developing key recommendations for how parents and families can be engaged in this conversation at their local schools and at the District; developing a document that outlines key principles for engaging parents in educator effectiveness that can be distributed amongst parent groups; and coordinating an official kickoff launch with the produced videos, profiles and information tools that will help inform ongoing and future discussions about how to best identify, support and retain effective teachers. 


","College Preparatory Curriculum: ABC coconvened the Communities for Educational Equity, a network of more than 20 organizations that mobilized thousands of parents, students, and stakeholders to advocate for LAUSD to adopt a policy that provides the AG college preparatory curriculum to all students.  The policy was adopted in 2005.





Pilot Schools and Zones of Choice:  In response to the poor academic outcomes produced at local schools, ABC incited and supported the District in its efforts to bring new, innovative models of learning to MidCity, Belmontarea students.  Today, these students are provided school choice through a novel program called the Belmont Zone of Choice.  Incoming 9th grade students choose among 19 careerthemed options housed within four campuses.





Linked Learning: ABC is committed to developing high quality college and career education opportunities via the Linked Learning approach to instruction.  Efforts include the successful passage of LAUSDs Linked Learning Resolution and the authoring of The BottomUp Approach: How Youth & Parent Organizing Strengthen Linked Learning Pathways to Both College and Career. ABC is also an evaluator for the Linked Learning Statewide Certification Review Team. 


 	


Afterschool Programs: ABC authored the report, â€œMaximizing After School Opportunities for English Learnersâ€ which outlined policy recommendations for improving the academic outcomes of ELs through after school programs.  As a result of the report, then Assembly member Torlakson authored AB 2178 which allows after school program operators to obtain student academic data from school districts in order to improve programming and service delivery to students and Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 2178 into law.  





Donâ€™t Hold Us Back Coalition: ABC was a leading member of this partnership comprised of a group of civil rights, parent and community organizations that believe every child deserves a quality public school education that prepares them for college and 21st century careers.. Our key demands to the LAUSD and the local teachers union included lifting the cap on teacherled school structures; providing multiple measure evaluations to teachers; and assigning teachers to schools based on student need and not ""mustplace"" hiring practices. As the spokesperson for the coalition, ABC used its platform in interviews with every major LA Spanish and English language newspaper and local media outlets, to describe how together, 100 parents and community members were mobilized, 26 organizations signed on to our efforts, close to 1,000 signed our petition, and as a result LAUSDUTLA passed the Local Schools Stabilization and Empowerment Initiative of 2011. Since the coalitionâ€™s efforts wrapped up in December 2011, ABC shared its efforts with teacher groups, community organizations, parent groups and researchers nationwide to promote the replication of this type of effort. ","ABC will work with teacher and student led organizations that have also identified educator effectiveness as a core priority, in order to highlight diverse voices in this public dialogue. ABC will partner with Teach Plus, a teacherled organization focused on developing the capacity of teachers; and Students for Education Reform (SFER), a student led group with local chapters across Southern California  who have also identified â€œgreat leaders, great teachersâ€ as important to the success of students.  TeachPlus and SFER have been approached to help identify teacher and student voices, respectively, that can speak to the importance of having an effective educator in every classroom and the important role of parents to ensure this happens.","To effectively measure its progress, ABC will set benchmarks for each of its major campaign activities and collect and document the following: number of coalition meetings; number of meetings with key LAUSD staff to discuss  policy language on the inclusion of parents and student voice in the identification and retention of educators; number of elected officials that sign on in support of our campaign; number of parents that participate in parent empowerment  trainings; number of media stories generated; number of community meetings/events hosted; number of informational brochures distributed; number of public actions taken by coalition, community and parents; number of visits to ABC website and ABC YouTube page that will host the parent, student and teacher videos and online profiles; number of â€œlikesâ€, retweets, and shares on the various social media sites that the video and online profiles will be shared through; number of visits to the online sites that have seen the videos and online profiles; and number of policies passed via District bulletins, resolutions, or state legislation that correspond to the messages being delivered by the public awareness campaign that highlight parent, teacher and student voices. Tools developed to collect this information may include: stakeholder surveys and interviews, media tracking, media content and framing analysis, policy tracking, and some public polling.  Additionally, to track ABCâ€™s effectiveness and meet program outcomes, ABCâ€™s Senior Policy Manager and Parent Organizer will meet with ABCâ€™s Associate Director in biweekly meetings to assess progress and to identify best practices and opportunities for improvement. During these meetings, ABCâ€™s Associate Director will use indicators listed above to determine efficacy and timeliness of program outcomes. ","Los Angeles stands to benefit from this project because the academic and social (human capital) development of our students is being shaped by more than 32,000 teachers that instruct over 667,250 students ever year in our public schools.  Research shows that 58% of a schoolâ€™s impact on student achievement is attributable to principal and teacher effectiveness. As a result, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial gains in student achievement that are sustained over time. Research has also shown that parents are a significant influence in the academic success of their children. Although studies often point to poverty as a significant predictor of low academic achievement, when parents and families are given the skills and tools necessary to create a nurturing learning environment, lowincome families and children can defy the odds (DavisKeane, 2007). Additionally, when parents are given decision making roles and considered equal partners in their childâ€™s education, they can become informed and effective advocates for their childâ€™s education.  





As the second largest school District in the nation, LAUSD is taking a step forward and leading the debate as it currently examines how it can best support its teacher and administrator workforce. We currently have a window of opportunity to engage in this discussion and most importantly to help shape it, so that we ensure that parents and families are seen as crucial partners and part of the solution to arriving at meaningful ways of identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators for their children. By launching a public education and awareness campaign around the importance of having an effective educator in every classroom, every school and offering tools and recommendations on parentsâ€™ roles in this issue, we will build critical links between policy development and ontheground teacher, student and parent realities, by broadening public accountability to include consumers. 





Ultimately, Los Angeles will benefit from having educators that are: 


	identified as highly effective to minimize inequitable access to quality teachers by lowincome and underrepresented families; 


	supported in their profession by receiving highquality, relevant professional development and resources to improve their craft, and; 


	retained in the classroom so that students have consistent and stable learning environments and teachers are rewarded for their positive contributions to student outcomes. 


","In the year 2050, education in Los Angeles will once again be amongst the top rated in the country. Groups from other school districts in the nation will be visiting LAUSD to learn about the effective teaching taking place in all of its classrooms.  Parents, teachers and students will continue to be welcomed contributors to the public dialogue about effective teaching, student achievement, and the importance of building a school community that responds to the needs of each one of these stakeholders.





The LAUSD will see parents are critical partners in the educator effectiveness conversation, and as such will design culturally and linguistically relevant tools that inform parents and families as well as obtain parental feedback on key school reform efforts.  In line with these changes, parent surveys will be used as one of the multiple indicators in teacher evaluations. Information regarding educator effectiveness will be readily available to parents so that they can be better advocates for their children and the teachers in their schools.  Teachers will not feel attacked or challenged when parents speak about educator effectiveness, because they will all be using similar language to describe their ambitions for the success of students. 





In addition, each student will have access to high quality instruction that will result in the elimination of the achievement gap, elimination of inequitable effective teacher distribution, reduced dropout rates, engaged students that are being challenged with rigorous and relevant instruction, and an increase in students being prepared for college and meaningful careers in a highly competitive economy. Educators that are struggling in the classroom will be able to receive helpful feedback from their performance evaluations and strong professional development and supports that improve their teaching.  Likewise, educators that are effectively teaching their students will be rewarded with transparent and unbiased feedback on their performance, as well as compensation based on their contributions to student outcomes and their school community.  





In 2050, teachers, parents and students will be regularly featured by the media, District and union leaders and educational pundits that want to add to the public dialogue about educational issues that matter to everyone and can be relatable by anyone. "
3102009,2013009,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/lagreenteensummit.html,LA Green Teen Summit: 2050 and Beyond, Social Connectedness,"<p>ACE knows that LA teens are motivated and passionate about their city. Weâ€™ve seen it in the work weâ€™ve been doing in LA high schools for the past four years, delivering climate science education and action programs to students. Most recently, we saw it when our students joined the Forward on Climate Rally on March 17th, 2013, gaining the attention of the public, the media, and the White House.</p>





<p>LAâ€™s game changers are in our high schools. This generation is more mobile and better connected than ever before, with new technology and social networking revolutionizing their potential to share ideas, build a movement and drive significant and sustainable change.</p>





<p>We want to bring all that energy, commitment and innovation together, in one room, and engage LAâ€™s youth in leading the changes we need to see in our city.</p>





<p>Over 200 high school seniors drawn from schools across LA, will be invited to participate in an LA Green Teen Summit, networking with their peers and connecting their shared passion to lead the movement against climate change and a vision of their cityâ€™s future â€“ environmentally and economically sustainable and thriving.</p>





<p>ACE will organize and deliver the two-day event, which will include seminars and training sessions co-facilitated by key individuals from partner organizations, as well as plenary presentations and Q&A. Students will have the opportunity to take part in education experiences as well as skills sessions, where they will learn team working, leadership and campaign skills, such as effective lobbying and public speaking.</p>





<p>ACEâ€™s team in LA will leverage their unparalleled reach into high schools across the city, through relationships with teachers, administrators and school districts, to invite teens together for the Green Teen Summit.</p>





<p>The Summit may be scheduled to coincide with PowerShift 2013, drawing from and in solidarity with the event in Pittsburgh, PA on October 18-21. http://www.wearepowershift.org/</p>





<p>ACE Educators in LA will bring campaign organizing expertise, building from student leadership training and mentoring that they have been delivering over the past 3 years.</p>





<p>With the support of ACE trainings and mentorship, ACEâ€™s green teen leaders have crafted a mission and message for â€œWaste Free Schoolsâ€ in LA,  that they will be delivering to City Hall via a peaceful, student-led rally at the CicLAvia event on April 21, 2013. http://www.ciclavia.org/</p>","<p>Since 2008, ACE has reached more than 1.5 million teens in over 2,000 schools across the country. Over 35,000 students in environmental action teams, have completed over 1,500 climate-saving projects in their schools and communities. Nearly 2,000 young people have attended ACE Leadership Trainings and we have elevated the voice of 9 Youth Reps â€“ the most dedicated, passionate youth climate leaders nationwide.</p>





<p>The video showing the impact of Santa Monica High Schoolâ€™s â€œTeam Marineâ€ is one example of the kind of student action and leadership that ACE supports and inspires. ACE took our multimedia assembly there in 2010 and our Educators have been working with Team Marine ever since. They have a highly engaged faculty sponsor, they won ACEâ€™s â€œStar Warsâ€ campaign a few years back, they took on our Biggest Loser Energy Challenge, and they used an ACE starter grant towards building an electric car:</p>

<p>Also, in January 2012, Kavi Reddy, an ACE Youth Advisory Board member, was the keynote speaker at SMUD's (Sacramento Municipal Utility District's) Youth Energy Summit. In 2011, in April 2011, ACE youth went to the White House to speak with Secretary of Energy Stephen Chu, and U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, about scaling energy-efficiency in U.S. public schools. ACE's programs provide both a foundation of knowledge in climate science, as well as the resources and support to turn that knowledge into action.</p>





<p>In the school year 2011-12, we both reached our 1 millionth student and received the EPA Region 1 (New England) Merit Award for outstanding contributions to preserving and protecting the environment, alongside renowned advocates like Gary Hirshberg, President and CEO of Stonyfield Farms.</p>





<p>In addition to this prestigious award, ACE was named Climate Change Communicator of the Year by George Mason Universityâ€™s Center for Climate Change Communication and received the 2011 Breathe California Clean Air Award for Public Awareness and Education.</p>","Partners from organizations such as Rock the Vote, Climate Resolve, Sierra Club Beyond Coal, and 350.org will be engaged to co-facilitate the summit with ACE Educators, delivering skills sessions in their areas of expertise, such as messaging, public speaking, organizing, and lobbying skills. ACE has existing relationships with groups and individuals from these and other, LA-based organizations, who will be invited to deliver seminar-style training sessions for students.","<p>Using Salesforce, ACE maintains a robust macrometrics system, tracking efficiency and output of our educator force nationwide as well as our activities in schools and with partner organizations. For instance, we track the impact of our education, action and leadership programs, including number of participating students, carbon-cutting projects completed, CO2 reduction achieved through projects, sustainability commitments pledged, and youth leaders trained.</p>





<p>This year, new metrics reflect ACEâ€™s strategic focus on deeper, more sustainable outcomes and measuring the true impact of our programs, including youth voice stories, level of teacher engagement, and student influence in each of ACEâ€™s regions and nationally.</p>





<p>In 2011, ACE implemented a behavior change survey, a national evaluation effort designed to better track program impact on students served. Working in close collaboration with survey experts at the Yale School of the Environment and Stanford Universityâ€™s Human-Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute, ACE surveyed its impact on science literacy, student behavior, and student attitudes related to climate. Summary results showed that:</p>





<p>Before the ACE Assembly, only 34% of students passed a basic climate science test.


After the ACE Assembly:</p>





<p>==>	59% of students passed the climate science knowledge test.


==>	We saw a 35% decrease in students categorized as Disengaged, Doubtful, or Dismissive.


==>	We saw a 40% increase in students categorized as Concerned or Alarmed. 


==>	48% of students felt more confident in their ability to help start a project to reduce their schoolâ€™s carbon footprint.


==>	The intention to ask parents or friends to reduce their footprints increased in 60% of students.</p>





<p>In fall 2012, ACE published the results of our national student survey effort and presented at prestigious research conferences including the AGU (American Geophysical Union) Fall Meeting, BECC (Behavior, Energy and Climate Change) Conference, and Culture, Politics, and Climate Change International Conference.</p>





<p>ACE plans to continue and expand our survey effort, building valuable data against which we can rigorously evaluate the impact of our programs. ACE also plans to begin a new evaluation project, tracking individual students over longer periods of time to identify their retention of knowledge and behavior change as well as their influence on parents' and household energy behaviors.</p>





<p>We will build on this firm foundation of survey and evaluation expertise to capture and report on the specific outcomes and results from ACEâ€™s LA2050 program.</p>","Over the course of the LA Green Teen Summit, these young leaders will identify the â€œhot topicâ€ for LA that they want to focus on in the coming semester. This might be greening their local community, starting with elevating the rate of waste recovery on their school campus, through to carbon reduction initiatives in support of LAâ€™s goals to reduce its emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. 





Following the Summit, ACE will support the students in taking action on the key issue that they identified as critical for immediate priority. Taking the skills that they learned, youth leaders will come together in smaller teams to tackle the issue in their local communities, share their ideas for citywide action and campaign for the initiatives that they want to see implemented.





ACE will offer mentoring and guidance, connecting teens to relevant partners and helping them to arrange meetings with district authorities, local politicians, and civic leaders.





Student leaders will be connected to each other at the Summit and beyond, through online interactions and offline actions that they will take together, supported by ACE. 





In December, the teens will come together again for a half-day Town Hall meeting with key representatives from the city of LA and local media. Selected student leaders, supported by their peers, will address the panel of guests and lobby for the changes that they want to see in their city. The city representatives will be given the opportunity to respond with a facilitated Q&A session.





The event will be set up and publicized well in advance, providing an opportunity for the city authorities to hear the collective voice of youth speak about what they want to see happen now â€“ and over the next 10, 20, 30 years â€“ to ensure a thriving, sustainable future for LA.","<p>ACE has a vision for LA and the nation, in which a generation of informed and connected American youth realizes its potential to act, innovate and influence others as an organized force to successfully confront the climate crisis. Through a strategy that emphasizes individual commitment and collective impact, we believe young people can catalyze public sector leadership, inspire worldview change, and drive economic transformation to mitigate the causes and consequences of climate change.</p>





<p>The climate crisis is the greatest threat humanity has seen and our time to solve this crisis is limited. The emerging generation of young leaders needs to be equipped to lead large-scale breakthroughs that will chart a fundamentally different course. The missing ingredient is a coordinated effort to educate, connect and inspire this generation to rewrite the future.</p>





<p>ACEâ€™s mission is to educate young people, to fundamentally shift the attitude and behavior of a generation and build the will to solve the climate crisis now. We want to see innovations, policies and practices led and implemented by an alliance of young, connected and diverse change-agents for the climate.</p>"
3102010,2013010,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FamilySchoolInteract.html,Parent and Child Training Program , Public Safety,"Roosevelt High School is quite possibly one the largest high school in the country with a student body of approximately 5,000 students.  It is located in the Boyle Heights area of the City of Los Angeles.  The school is known for having violent incidents on campus and students report that they often do not feel safe at school.  Boyle Heights is also home to many gangs.  While there are local programs such as the Gang Reduction and Youth Development Program that have made some progress, the teens continue to be exposed to various risk factors that might lead to gang affiliation including but not limited to poor parental supervision, negative peer influences, substance use, tagging crews and underlying mental health issue which often are undiagnosed.  With the increase in violence and gun violence in schools in this country, this project proposes to provide a 20-week group family sessions in an effort to preventing future violence.  


The Parent and Child Training Program will raise parentâ€™s awareness of risk factors, warning signs and behaviors that might indicate more serious issues. This program falls under the Prevention and Early Intervention model by providing parents and youth with coping skills as a way of prevention potential incarcerations, school failure or dropout, prolonged suffering, legal problems and removal of children from their homes. These 20-week sessions will be provided to both parents and their children simultaneously.  Parents and Youth will meet at the School Site and then break into their two groups which will be lead by their respective group facilitators. At the end of each group discussion a meal will be provided where parents and youth will engage together in a family activity aimed at promoting family bonding, modeling the use of appropriate relational skills and reinforcing concepts introduced during instructional groups. A violence reduction and behavioral modification curriculum will be used to assist youth to identify the roots of violence, how to prevent violent outbursts, increasing their awareness of the connections between alcohol/drugs and violence and ultimately develop better interpersonal and problem solving skills. In other words, teens will discuss a range of topics aimed at increasing their analytical skills, ability to integrate what they learn in real life and learn how to work collaboratively. Simultaneously, a diverse set of problem-solving skills and interventions will be introduced, modeled and role-played with parents. Group instruction will also make way for parents to share their personal struggles, parenting styles and interventions.


 This Projectsâ€™ outcomes include but are not limited to: Projected Outcomes: 


â€¢    Improvement in the quality of the parent-child relationship


â€¢    Improvement in parenting skills, including positive discipline


â€¢    Improvement in parent's attitude about parenting 


â€¢    Improvement in the youthâ€™s behavior at home, at school and with peers


â€¢    Improvement in parentsâ€™ self esteem and confidence over their parenting skills


â€¢    Reduction in risk of child abuse


This program will be open for Students from Roosevelt High school and their parents/caregivers. This project is aligned with the ongoing development of a â€œSuper Highwayâ€ of services between Roosevelt High School and The Wellness Center at the Historic General Hospital currently being developed by Supervisor Gloria Molinaâ€™s office. Alma Family Services will connect students and their families (when appropriate) to additional services provided at the Wellness Center set to open between May and July, 2013. Alma Family Services will be able to screen project participantsâ€™ needs and link these individuals/families to the various organizations providing services at the Wellness Center. Safety discussions and interventions will be related to the improvement of the school climate at Roosevelt High School as well as the Boyle Heights community at large. 


","Alma Family Services was established in 1975 in East Los Angeles by parents to provide, along with other purposes, a comprehensive range of multilingual community based services for those with special needs including emotional, physical and/or developmental delay and their families. 





â€¢	Alma Family Servicesâ€™ mission speaks to our commitment to improve the quality of life for members of our communities. This often means advocating for at risk children and families.  Almaâ€™s dedication goes beyond providing culturally competent services and supports and integrates our history of helping to develop and support healthy communities through collaborative community relationships. Almaâ€™s approach is strength-based, community centered and child and family focused.  Individuals and families are understood to be multi-dimensional with strengths as well unique needs. 


â€¢	School-Based/Linked Services:  Alma Family Services has been providing school-based Prevention and Early Intervention services for over ten (10) years.  School-based counseling, individual and family psychotherapy, groups and case management services are being provided at many school within several school districts including Montebello Unified School District (MUSD), El Rancho Unified School District and the Los Angeles Unified School Districts.  


â€¢	Gang Reduction Youth Development (GRYD) Program:  Alma Family Services has been operating a gang prevention program through a contract with the City of Los Angeles since 2009 or four (4) years.  The GRYD program includes an array of services such as a comprehensive case management, parenting classes, individual and family counseling, leadership development, youth mentoring, violence prevention training, substance use/abuse awareness and gang-prevention training.





Alma Family Services has been recognized at the State, County and City Level for its commitment in delivering high quality services. 


","LAUSD, Roosevelt High School, The Wellness Center at the Historic General Hospital agency partners and the Department of Mental Health (DMH). ","Alma will measure progress towards goals of this project through participant surveys, track attendance and closely monitor and document each activity of the project to assure that objectives and deliverables are completed according to plan. At enrollment, each student and parent will be interviewed by a case manager who will collaboratively identify goals to be met at the end of the project. 2-3 Behavioral goals will be identify for each student and each parents regarding their academic/social functioning as well as the parent-child relationship. Goals will be reviewed with students and parents individually after 10 weeks and once again at the end of the project.  Students will be linked to academic enrichment and recreational activities as way to utilize pro-social skills introduced by this project. Studentâ€™s school attendance and report cards will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the program. Case Manager will also collaborate others involved with the student/family such as the school counselor, probation officer and DCFS social worker (if applicable) in order to identify target risk factors that must be further address beyond the group instruction.  Surveys will be provided to case workers involved with student/family if applicable. ","â€¢	This project can be replicated throughout Los Angeles once proven effective at Roosevelt High School. Alma Family Servicesâ€™ knowledge and track record using different Evidence Based Practices and other Prevention and Early Intervention models has led to significant reduction of risk factors that might lead to violent behavior. Implementation of this program will directly affect Roosevelt High School and the community at large by addressing the roots of violence. Several studies have indicated that violence leads to truancy, lower educational attainment and thus lower level jobs. Also, the psychoemotional and financial cost of violence in schools to poorer families is high, affecting their ability to escape the poverty trap. This project aims at reducing youthâ€™s arrests for crimes including vandalism, trespassing, and tagging. Primary and secondary prevention programs have the potential to generate systemic change. Students will be encouraged to practice cooperation and show responsibility towards their own school and community. Family engagement is critical to promote student achievement. Successful students are more likely to become productive citizens and contribute with their community, the City and County of Los Angeles. ","Each school in Los Angeles should implement programs aimed at promoting family engagement, improving school readiness and reducing risk factors that might lead to violence. Our hope is that increasing parental participation in their childrenâ€™s social and academic lives can become a priority for our schools. It is true that schools alone cannot meet all their studentâ€™s needs, specially the needs of students with psycho-emotional issues and/or families dealing with multiple stressors. By facilitating parentsâ€™ access to existing networks of service providers, schools will be able to empower these caregivers to take charge of their childrenâ€™s overall functioning and development. That begins with educating parents on the importance of supporting their children and becoming more involved with the school, community and the different systems of care capable of contributing to studentsâ€™ success. Educators, parents and community members will be able to build a common understanding of each personâ€™s role in helping students meet academic and social expectations and help students meet their goals.

3102011,2013011,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/EarlyDetection.html,Changing the Course of the Alzheimerâ€™s Epidemic in L.A. County:  Early Detection Counts Campaign, Health,"<p>Los Angeles County is sorely underprepared for the aging of our regionâ€™s population.  The number of older adults in this area is growing dramatically and this has ramifications for our health care system, our families, our schools, and our businesses. Never before have so many lived such long lives.  Over the past 100 years, our society has addressed many root causes of early mortality â€“ infectious diseases like polio and TB have declined dramatically. More recently, weâ€™ve seen a dramatic fall in mortality rates from chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. A diagnosis of cancer of AIDS is no longer a death notice.  Weâ€™ve learned ways to decrease risk for diabetes and heart disease and to better manage their care.  Now we are seeing the rise of the scourge of the 21st Century, and that is Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias. </p> 





<p>Currently, in Los Angeles County there are 165,000 people living with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and more with related disorders.  By 2050, this number is expected to triple.  Our region will have more people living with Alzheimerâ€™s disease than the entire current population of the cities of Sacramento or Long Beach.  Due to poorer health care access and rapidly aging populations, the numbers of local Latinos and Asians with cognitive impairment is going to increase even more quickly.  Yet, we know that fewer than 25% of people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or a related dementia ever get a diagnosis and if a disease isnâ€™t recognized, it cannot be treated.  These conditions are the silent epidemic of the new century.</p>  





<p>If this epidemic is not checked and care is not improved, then:</p>


<p>â€¢	Cognitive impairment will complicate the care of all other chronic conditions, putting a tremendous financial burden on hospitals, on public programs like Medicare and MediCal and on families.</p>


<p>â€¢	Caregiving families will be forced to make stark sacrifices, financially and emotionally, to care for their loved ones.</p>


<p>â€¢	Children in these families will not receive the attention and resources they need to thrive as families dedicate time and money to keep impaired loved ones at home.</p>


<p>â€¢	Families will be forced to provide complex care on their own as there will be insufficient health care and community care providers to meet the epidemic level of need.</p>





<p>However, all is not bleak.  Due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) there are opportunities to address this emerging epidemic through our reorganized health care system.  This year, for the first time, the federal government has begun to mandate an Annual Wellness Visit for all Americans.  A required part of this medical visit will be a screen for cognitive impairment.  If implemented successfully, this new benefit will result in the systematic and early identification of people with cognitive impairment.  It will also mean that cognitively impaired people will be referred for diagnosis so that reversible forms of dementia can be identified and treated.  For those diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or a related condition, it will mean that minimally, their other coexisting conditions (like diabetes and heart disease) will be cared for more appropriately, cutting unnecessary patient suffering, family burden, and health care costs.  As more effective treatments for Alzheimerâ€™s come to market, earlier detection will mean that these treatments reach patients earlier in the disease, when they can have a more significant effect.</p>  





<p>To impact the health of Angelenos in this first half of the 21st Century, the Alzheimerâ€™s Association, California Southland Chapter proposes to leverage the new Annual Wellness Visits mandated through the ACA to reach L.A.â€™s physicians and other health care providers with information and tools about: </p>


<p>1.	How to screen their patients for cognitive impairment;</p>


<p>2.	How to manage these conditions both medically and through family support.</p>


<p>Collaborating with local health care provider associations and health care organizations, the Association will disseminate a brief onepage document that can be distributed as a centerfold in medical providersâ€™ newsletters, posted on their websites, or distributed by health insurers.  Following up on this written communication, the Alzheimerâ€™s Association will develop a cadre of volunteers to make office calls and visits to reinforce the importance of early detection and emphasize the availability of training and resources to support providers, patients and caregivers.</p>


","<p>Founded by concerned family caregivers in 1980 and incorporated in 1981, the Alzheimerâ€™s Association, California Southland Chapter is an independent affiliate of the national voluntary health organization.  The Alzheimer's Association, California Southland Chapter is a pioneer in the development of innovative programs and services specific to the needs of a diverse population effected by dementia. Access to care has been a longterm investment of effort by out organization.  In 1992, the California Southland Chapter was the lead and originator of the nationâ€™s first program serving Latinos with dementia, El Portal.  This program received numerous national awards including the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Community Health Leadership Award.  El Portal has been replicated in numerous locations throughout the state and beyond.  It has also been replicated in African American, Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese communities.  The Chapterâ€™s program for Asian Americans with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and their caregivers was awarded the 2006 Met Life Foundation/National Center for Caregiving award for innovation in education and Alzheimerâ€™s disease and the 2011 Rosalynn and Arthur Gilbert Foundationâ€™s Caregiving Legacy Award.</p>





<p>The challenge of delivering quality health care to people with dementia has also been addressed successfully by this chapter of the Association. These efforts have also led to national recognition. For example, a quality improvement project with Kaiser Permanente was awarded the American Society on Agingâ€™s 2001 Award for Quality and Innovation in Managed Care and Aging.  Our consumer activation project, Partnering with Your Doctor, was honored with the Archstone FoundationAmerican Public Health Associationâ€™s 2003 Award for Excellence in Program Innovation and adopted for national replication by the Alzheimerâ€™s Association.  It was also adopted in parts of Great Britain.  The local chapter of the Alzheimerâ€™s Association has led three statewide efforts to create and disseminate an evidencebased practice guideline that teaches primary care providers about quality postdiagnostic care for people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. This California Guideline for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Management became the stimulant for numerous quality improvement projects in health care organizations throughout California including Kaiser Permanente, Scripps Health Care, UC San Diego Health Care and SCAN Health Plan.  This chapter also played a leadership role in the development of the State of Californiaâ€™s Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Plan which was released in 2011.</p>


","The Alzheimerâ€™s Association, California Southland Chapter has forged awardwinning collaborations with several L.A. health care systems and with organizations that serve families in our ethnically diverse area.  For the Early Detection Counts Campaign, the Association will seek to partner with  health care organizations like these to increase awareness and provider skills:  L.A. County Medical Association, Community Clinics Association of L.A. County, Los Angeles County Osteopathic Medical Association, Angeles Independent Physicians Association, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, SCAN Health Plan, Care 1st Health Plan, Molina HP, Care 1st, the County hospitals (Olive View, Rancho & County USC) and the California Association of Physician Groups.","<p>Evaluation of the project will take place on three levels: </p>


<p>1.	First there will be a formative evaluation using a virtual focus group of health care providers to provide feedback on the one page document that will be used to educate providers about the Annual Wellness Visit, screening for cognitive impairment, and supports for patients and caregiving families.  This portion of the evaluation will be used to develop the final tool for dissemination.</p>


<p>2.	Second, there will be a process evaluation to determine whether the numerical goals of the project have been achieved. These include:</p>


<p>a.	Partnership with at least 10 health care associations or organizations for dissemination of the early detection tool.</p>


<p>b.	Reaching 80% of all health care professionals in the region through a communication campaign conducted through partnerships with health care associations and organizations.</p>


<p>c.	Recruitment of a corps 10 of volunteers to call or visit provider offices and reinforce campaign messaging,  </p>


<p>3.  Third, there will be an evaluation of impact.  A crosssection of the health care providers contacted will be surveyed to determine if they feel better equipped to screen patients for cognitive impairment.</p>


","<p>Due to health care reform, there is an opportunity now for transformational change in medical care.  This change provides a chance to alter the course of the Alzheimerâ€™s epidemic; to change how people with cognitive impairment are viewed and treated; and to change the quality of life of the people who care for them.  Intervention now can save our region millions of dollars in unnecessary costs for hospitalizations and nursing home care.   It can remove a predictable threat to the solvency of our public health care system.  </p>


<p>Changing the course of the epidemic in L.A. Countyâ€“ Currently, the numbers of people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias are poised to skyrocket. Among Latinos and Asians, the increases will be most dramatic. Yet, due to nihilism and lack of accurate information, health care providers are not recognizing the disease and do not diagnose or treat the great majority of cases.  These individuals are doubly victimized by their conditions.  They suffer the relentless loss of their minds, and are frequently misunderstood and mistreated, by their families and by health care providers.  This project will dramatically increase the detection of dementing diseases by our regionâ€™s health care providers and result in improved treatment and care.</p>


<p>Saving our health care system â€“ Unrecognized cognitive impairment is expensive.  It creates barriers to the management of comorbid health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  It leads to poor management of the needs of the patient.  It drives up expenditures for Medicare, MediCal and private insurance.  Several research studies have demonstrated that better detection, treatment and care management can lead to lower expenditures for emergency room visits, hospital stays, and doctor visits.  Better care and access to community supports may also reduce expensive and unnecessary stays in nursing homes.  This level of care can cost $90,000 or more per year and is born by families and the MediCal program.  Better managed care will reduce costs to the private and public health care systems resulting in economic benefit to the government, employers and individual households.</p>


<p>Changing the lives of families  Early detection means that families and patients will gain access to better quality health care and supports.  L.A.â€™s caregiving families will suffer less burden and depression.  They will be better shielded from financial devastation because recognition of dementing conditions will help with their management and with the management of comorbid conditions like diabetes and heart disease.  Better understanding of cognitive impairment will allow families more opportunity to plan for the future and get appropriate care.  This is turn will lead to reduced absenteeism both at work for adults and in school for children in households dealing with the overwhelming burden of caregiving.  </p>


","<p>As a result of an investment in the Early Detection Counts campaign there will be a change in the course of the Alzheimerâ€™s epidemic in Los Angeles County. Our vision is a community in which:</p>


<p>â€¢	Individuals with cognitive impairment will be screened and if appropriate, sent for a diagnostic workup.</p>


<p>â€¢	All diagnosed people with a dementing disease will have access to treatment for the disease and high quality management of comorbid illnesses.</p>


<p>â€¢	People living with dementia and their families will be connected to community services for support, disease education, and care planning to optimize their lives.</p>


<p>â€¢	People living with dementia will receive appropriate communitybased care and not receive inappropriate institutional care in hospitals or nursing homes.</p>


<p>â€¢	MediCal dollars will be preserved rather than squandered inappropriately.</p>

3102012,2013012,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/PrepareLA.html,PrepareLA â€“ Building Resilience through Community and Volunteer Engagement, Social Connectedness,"PrepareLA is an innovative campaign designed by the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region to engage individuals and communities in taking preparedness action so that they are better equipped to respond to emergencies and disasters. As part of this effort, the Red Cross is mobilizing volunteers, educating residents, raising public awareness, and leveraging community partnerships to help drive resilience throughout Los Angeles County. 





For decades, the Red Cross has worked to increase emergency preparedness, but despite our efforts, the number of prepared Angelenos remains acutely small: a County of Los Angeles Public Health survey shows that a mere 6 percent of households reported being â€œcompletely preparedâ€ for a disaster. At the same time, the number of large disasters in the United States continues to rise, and with Los Angeles being a densely populated urban area prone to wildfires and earthquakes, the necessity of preparing for a major disaster is more evident than ever.





In light of this situation, the Red Cross has devised a new way to increase not only preparedness but also resilience in the communities we serve. PrepareLA tackles preparedness and resilience at the individual, organizational, AND community level. This is important for two reasons: 1) social scientists have shown that one of the ways in which people become more motivated to take preparedness actions is to hear about them from many different angles (in the media, at work, at their place of worship, at school, in the grocery store) and when they see other people taking preparedness actions; and 2) together, a community is able to manage challenges that go beyond what any unaffiliated group of individuals can accomplish. The PrepareLA campaign was created on the principle that resilience is driven in large part on the relationships and trust that are built among the various sectors of a community. 





While PrepareLA includes goals to build capacity in the areas of mass care, human resources, and communications, it places much of its focus on increasing community engagement. It is our goal that each of Los Angeles Countyâ€™s 272 communities will be prepared for a largescale disaster. This includes trained volunteers, individuals who are educated on lifesaving skills such as CPR and first aid, and emergency plans that have been designed by community members based on their own risk and resource assessments. In order to achieve this, we have created innovative preparedness strategies:





The COMMUNITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM recruits community leaders to serve as liaisons with the Red Cross and promote preparedness in their neighborhoods. These communitycentric volunteers, who reside and work in the area, help bridge the gap between community needs and Red Cross services. Our threeyear goal is to have each of the 272 Los Angeles communities represented by an Ambassador who will help create awareness and movement toward community preparedness. Community Ambassadors receive training and are provided with materials to assist in their role, including a Community Scorecard. This scorecard is used to track the success of the Ambassadorsâ€™ efforts in their communities toward three of our core PrepareLA goals: (1) increasing community engagement through preparedness education and outreach, (2) volunteer recruitment, and (3) strengthening feeding and sheltering capacity. Community Ambassadors meet quarterly as a group to discuss strategies, recent accomplishments and challenges, and how they can work together to leverage and share community resources.





The FAITHBASED PROGRAM aims to connect the Red Cross with faith organizations to introduce PrepareLA and promote services that foster community resilience. We are inviting all faith organizations in the region to become official Red Cross Affiliates that will serve the community through outreach, preparedness, volunteering, and sheltering & feeding partnerships. These collaborations are critical as we know that in the event of a disaster many people naturally turn to the faith community. As part of the campaign, we have hired a FaithBased Coordinator to serve as the link between the Red Cross and the faith community and develop new relationships and strengthen existing ones.





PrepareLA will directly impact Social Connectedness in Los Angeles by providing a platform where residents can come together to volunteer and make a difference in the life of their communities. By encouraging everyone to take preparedness action both at the individual and community levels, PrepareLA inspires us to interact with our neighbors and be active participants of society. The importance of this initiative has already caught the attention of several other Red Cross regions in Southern California and prompted them to join our efforts, and PrepareLA is now part of a larger PrepareSoCal campaign.","Here in the Los Angeles region, the Red Cross responds on average to one emergency every day, ranging from singlehome fires to wildfires affecting hundreds of families. This past fiscal year alone, we responded to 328 emergencies and assisted 457 families, opening 10 shelters and activating feeding canteens more than 15 times. This is only possible through our dedicated staff and volunteers taking the required training, being oncall, and working as a team to support the communities we serve. It is this preparation that allows us not only to respond to emergencies here but also support national operations such as Superstorm Sandy. To date, we have deployed four Emergency Response Vehicles and more than 160 staff and volunteers from Los Angeles to the East Coast. In addition to supporting relief operations, deployment also helps our local volunteers to get the handson experience they will need when a large disaster occurs here at home.





Additionally, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region was very successful in launching the PrepareLA campaign last year. The combination of a public awareness campaign and new Community Ambassador and FaithBased programs have already started to create a wordofmouth, multiplying effect that has resulted in a 66% increase in the number of individuals participating in free preparedness education presentations. While two years ago our volunteers were cold calling community and faithbased organizations and schools to offer these free services and were being largely turned down, now we are facing the challenge of keeping up with the increased demand.





Other major accomplishments during fiscal year 2012 include:





o Conducting free Preparedness Education presentations to 24,871 individuals (almost half of these presentations were directed towards vulnerable populations including 34% youth and 6% seniors); 


o Providing 27% of Preparedness Education presentations to individuals in languages other than English, including: Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog, and Thai;


o  Making 321,411 impressions at community events;


o Enlisting 14 Community Ambassadors to represent 23% of Los Angeles communities;


o Securing 35 FaithBased affiliates, whose partnerships drove over 15% of our Preparedness Education requests;


o Engaging 1,595 Youth and Young Adult Volunteers via 52 Red Cross Youth Clubs;


o Increasing the number of trained and readytodeploy Disaster Volunteers to 1,611;


o Augmenting our sheltering capacity from 210,000 to 258,149 spaces;


o Completing 144 new shelter surveys, which provide us with critical information regarding how many individuals will be allowed at each shelter site in an emergency; and


o Adding the capacity to serve an additional 150,000 meals a day through new agreements, which will enable us to serve nearly 2 million meals a day in the event of a catastrophic disaster.


","While responsibility for the overall PrepareLA strategy and implementation lies within the Red Cross, we will only be able to achieve our goals with support from and continuous collaboration with local community groups and other organizations. Examples include our partnerships with Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Map Your Neighborhood, and the Community Police Advisory Board, among many others. ","Overall PrepareLA goals are projected to be met over three years.





From July 1 to December 31, 2013, we expect to achieve the following measurable outcomes through our Community and Volunteer Engagement efforts:





1) Identify and recruit Community Ambassadors to represent an additional 25 communities in Los Angeles County and provide them with ongoing training;


2) Establish partnerships with 5 new FaithBased Affiliates;


3) Recruit at least 500 new Red Cross volunteers;


4) Conduct preparedness education presentations for 15,400 individuals (including youth, seniors, nonEnglish speakers, and individuals with functional needs); and 


5) Make 172,500 impressions through Community Outreach events (impressions are calculated based on the number of individuals who attend a community event where the Red Cross has an informational booth).





To measure progress, an internal management execution document tracks PrepareLA goals and objectives and outlines the methodology used to achieve each of them. Leadership staff project target numbers at the beginning of each fiscal year and develop execution plans detailing the activities and steps necessary to reach each goal. In each area, program staff are charged with developing tools for managing activities and monitoring progress. Data is compiled on a quarterly basis and measured toward PrepareLA overall goals. 





Additionally, progress against all goals is continuously measured by our local executive staff and monitored by two distinct committees:





PrepareLA Staff Committee â€“ Leadership staff is responsible for executing and evaluating campaign goals; providing updates on and adjustments to overall plan; developing quarterly reports to share with the PrepareLA Executive Committee, Board, and stakeholders.





PrepareLA Executive Committee â€“ Board members and key staff provide oversight of campaign progress. This includes fundraising, communications, community preparedness, and disaster response. This committee assesses campaign performance against campaign objectives and timelines; assists with high level messaging and stakeholder/partner outreach; represents donor perspective in strategic and major campaign decisions; and informs the full Board of PrepareLA progress.


","In recent years, we have seen an increase in major disasters across the globeâ€”Hurricane Katrina, earthquakes in Chile and Haiti, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and most recently Superstorm Sandy. However, while the number of disasters has increased steadily from the 1970s to today, the reported loss of life has been decreasing, demonstrating that early warnings, preparedness, and planning can save lives. 





The Los Angeles region is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes. Sadly, the majority of our communities and residents are woefully underprepared. If a magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikesâ€”as the U.S. Geological Survey predicts is overdueâ€”the loss of lives and infrastructure damage could be devastating. This is why we must engage our local communities now and start creating a culture of preparedness and resilience.





PrepareLA will significantly benefit Los Angeles by:


o Creating public awareness through multiple media outlets that provide comprehensive and continual disaster preparedness education;


o Promoting volunteerism and opportunities for civic engagement;


o Conducting free preparedness education presentations for residents (including youth, seniors, nonEnglish speakers, and individuals with functional needs);


o Developing multilingual, multicultural collateral materials to promote preparedness efforts; and


o Offering free first aid and CPR classes to lowincome and underserved communities.





An example of how PrepareLA is already increasing teamwork between the Red Cross and different community segments is our partnership with Faithful Central Bible Church in Inglewood. Our relationship began four years ago when the church signed an agreement with the Red Cross to serve as a shelter site in the event of a disaster. In 2012, our Coordinator invited the church to deepen the collaboration and become a Red Cross FaithBased Affiliate. Since then we have worked with them to host a series of outreach events and CPR/first aid trainings for church members and the community at large. This partnership has been particularly fruitful as it has connected the Red Cross with a large number of individuals in a densely populated, lowincome area.





With support from individuals, organizations, businesses and government agencies, we hope to be able to maintain and expand these types of partnerships and increase the number of Angelenos who have taken the necessary preparedness steps to be ready for an emergency. As we all know, disasters can strike at any time, without warning. While we cannot control the timing, we can work to ensure that we are as prepared as we can possibly be. If a high magnitude earthquake hits the Los Angeles region before the community is prepared, damage and loss will be far greater than if tools, partnerships, and materials are in place. An investment in community education and capacity building now will help reduce the impact of a catastrophic disaster, and will save lives.","In an ideal future, the Los Angeles of 2050 would be a region where everyone dedicates time to participate in and better their communities. Neighbors would know each other and be connected to local organizations and community groups. And volunteering wouldnâ€™t be a second thought, something that only a few idealists and seniors do. Children would learn the value of humanitarianism and civic engagement early on, and high school and college students would take advantage of volunteer opportunities not only to build their resume but also to make a difference in the lives of others. This experience would in turn give young people â€œa sense of purpose and a reason to remain in school and strive to learn,â€ as research by the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund already demonstrates. And all adults and retirees would volunteer their time to teach preparedness education and respond to emergencies in the region. 





All Angelenos would have the knowledge and skills necessary to help themselves and each other prepare for and respond to lifethreatening emergencies. And in the event of a catastrophic earthquake, Los Angeles would not only be able to survive and withstand the damage but also quickly bounce back. This would be possible because the community would already have the connections, skills, and resources to draw upon after a disaster.





There are still 37 years to go before 2050, but the Red Cross is working aggressively to effect change in the immediate future and start moving the needle toward a more connected, engaged, and resilient Los Angeles. We hope you will join us.

3102013,2013013,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/fundthisproject.html,LA v2.0: Transforming LA into a World Class Place to Live, Housing,"Our goal is nothing less than to lay the foundation so we will transform Los Angeles into a world class city and region by 2050, by tackling the biggest obstacle to meeting the housing problems LA2050 lays out. 


<br><br>


 


The reality is that we cannot solve the regionâ€™s housing challenges without first addressing that sibling of land use issues: transportation. An adequate rail transportation system â€“ like most other large cities have  is the means to an end here for making it politically possible to build the ample, denser housing needed to increase affordability and meet current and future needs. The biggest challenge to building the housing supply that will meet demand and lower costs, and to making areas with affordable housing accessible, is our traffic and lack of adequate mobility options, which causes citizens to block new housing construction.


<br><br>


Our LA2050 project will propose, legitimize, and build a movement for a fullybuilt out, fast rail transit system in Los Angeles County: fast, ubiquitous subway lines that connect housing, jobs centers, and major destinations; and frequent, expanded commuter rail to connect more affordable housing areas. New York City has it. London has it. Tokyo has it. Paris has it. Chicago has it. Los Angeles doesnâ€™t, and weâ€™ll never be a world class livable city until we do. And we certainly will never be able to meet our housing challenges until we do.


<br><br>


We wonâ€™t just propose a vision; we will legitimize it and build a movement of supporters. 


<br><br>


To do so,. this year we will host an international distinguished speaker series bringing top global thinkers & doers to LA to inject global thinking into the civic conversation in LA, and to speak to the impact that other citiesâ€™ fully builtout rail systems have had on livability. Modeled on an expanded version of the Dutch Embassy's 2011 ThinkBikeLA weekend, which resulted in green bike lanes in LA, we will invite speakers of the caliber of Boris Johnson (Mayor of London), Tyler BrÃ»lÃ© (founder of Monocle & Wallpaper, Financial Times columnist, known for Monocleâ€™s Global Quality of Life report), and Bruce Katz (director of Brookingsâ€™ Metropolitan Policy Program). Beyond our own events, we will invite the LA Mayor and other civic elites to host additional receptions, highlevel meetings, or workshops to maximize the visitors' influence.


<br>


We also propose to make infographics & a video to build momentum for our vision and to highlight other cities that have coordinated and met their housing and transportation challenges, to inspire Angelenos that we can do so, too. (We have already have an Emmy/Peabody award winning documentary producer who wants to do a longer, multiyear documentary project for us (funding permitting); this YouTube video could either be a short 23 min. documentarystyle video, or an independently produced viral video similar to â€œDid You Know?â€ (http://youtu.be/PHmwZ96_Gos).


<br><br>


We will make presentations on our LA2050 vision  and how to fund it to make it happen  to major business, civic, labor, environmental, and land use groups and leaders, signing up endorsers and building a coalition of supporters. We will work through the media to attract signatories from the broader legions of frustrated commuters, and we will do other efforts advancing our mission. 


<br><br>


INDICATOR


There are three primary reasons that a fully built out rail transportation system impacts the Housing Indicator: 





<br><br>


1) despite housing shortage â€“ and the according increase in housing costs, the lack of a fully built out rail system causes traffic gridlock, blocking new housing construction from being approved due to community concerns about traffic impacts of new development. (Our groupâ€™s president used to staff the Land Use Committee at a major business group and saw this firsthand.)


<br><br>





2) areas that do have (more) affordable housing in the suburbs and exurbs lack subways or adequate commuter rail linkages, unlike counterparts in other cities.


<br><br>





3) Angelenos have less money to spend on housing due to high transportation costs. Unlike in other cities, transit often isnâ€™t a practical option. The average Angeleno could save $900 per commuter per month by taking transit and giving up a car (http://bit.ly/XFWdVk), money that could go towards housing expenses. 


<br><br>





But perhaps the issue is best illustrated by this anecdote from a LA Times article by Christopher Hawthorne: ""Ron Galarze, who works in the epicure department at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills ...takes the bus to the store from his home in Whittier, a trip that takes between 90 minutes and 2 1/2 hours each way."" Housing & transportation issues are intimately linked.


<br><br>


By building a comprehensive rail transit system, we will be able to remake LA, with dense housing developments along transit lines and near job centers. We canand mustâ€“remake LA into a livable, world class city.","Before we tout our own horn, we should note you don't have to take our word for it about our achievements. Some of Los Angeles' most prominent leaders and foundations have given major donations  and in each case, major followon donations  to us, including business leaders Elon Musk (of Tesla & SpaceX fame), the David Bohnett Foundation, and Robert A. Day (of Trust Company of the West). They've found our achievements worthy of repeated funding, and we appreciate the Goldhirsh Foundation's consideration of joining the ranks of our funding partners. 


<br><br>


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS<br>


* Laying the groundwork for $40 billion in transportation funding: our CEO Summit at the City Club on Bunker Hill brought together prominent business leaders to get everyone together on the need to dramatically increase the momentum for change.  The next day's LA Times announced the support by business leaders for a sales tax for transportation, and the LA Business Journal featured a dedicated editorial praising the event and the newfound sense of possibility.  Speakers included David Fleming (recent Chair of the LA Chamber, and Chair of BizFed), Bob Lowe (Chairman/CEO of Lowe Enterprises), Pam O'Connor (Metro Board Chair), among others; event partners included Metro, the LA Chamber, and BizFed.


<br><br>


* Programs attracting key elected officials and policymakers.  Our events have attracted leaders from the LA City Council & Mayor's Office, Santa Monica City Council, Assembly, Senate, Metro Board, etc.

(Our efforts under the names Angelenos Against Gridlock, and our predecessor efforts under the name Building LA's Future are covered herein.)","Our past event partners include the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Metro, FAST, and BizFed, and weâ€™ve collaborated with civic elites and organizations in DC & LA too numerous to fit into the space here (email us for details). After LA2050 green lights our new project, we will reach out to potential collaborators such as: The new LA Mayor & groups like the Mayor's Council on Innovation & Industry ( PDF: http://bit.ly/15R8kCc), and local housing/transportation advocates like ULI, LAANE, Move LA, the LA Chamber, etc; national/international experts; GOOD/CORPS: if GOOD might consider probono advice on infographics/messaging, we'd love to widely distribute our own leaflets on this issue. (LOVED GOOD's work for Starbucks.)","Given that our project seeks to lay the stage for the transformation of Los Angeles in the long term, we have developed the following metrics to assist with evaluation in the shorter term:


<br><br>


REACH: 


* Through the Media: the quality and quantity of media coverage of our vision for LA and of the projects in this proposal <br>


* Key influencers: what civic elites and key influencers and policymakers have we reached with our efforts? <br> 


* Presentations/meetings: what groups have we made presentations to or met with? <br>


* Event attendance: how many people have attended our events? what types of audience members have we reached  have we reached a broad spectrum of people (business leaders, housing/transportation advocates, advocates for working families and the poor, policymakers, etc.)<br>


* Distribution of materials: how have our outreach materials been distributed? how many people have they reached?


<br><br>


Ultimate goal is for denser housing (as opposed to endless sprawl) in LA made possible by a fully builtout transit system.





<br><br>


VISION<br>


* Are we thinking big enough? Are we pushing LA to break the status quo?<br>








<br><br>


SUPPORTERS/SIGNATORIES:<br>


* What groups/organizations/prominent leaders sign on to our vision for LA? (Conversely, are we attracting naysayers  a sign and gaining attention?)<br>


* How many citizens have signed on to our vision for LA?","Let's face it. Life right now in the Los Angeles region is a dysfunctional mess. Millions of us suffer every day through the infamous reality of how difficult it is to slog from farflung housing to jobs, without the adequate commuter options that other cities around the world have, but we have never managed to achieve.  With high demand versus available supply, some choose to move to more affordable suburbs and exurbs â€“ but then contribute to the traffic problem (given the lack of adequate transit options), contributing to the gridlock that blocks new housing from being built closer to job centers and bringing down costs in the first place.





Revolutionizing access to housing by transforming Angelenos commuting options will transform the daily experience for commuting Angelenos, open up a revolutionary number of new, denser housing options constructed near rail stations and near job centers, and reduce costs for transportation bared by working families, freeing up income to be able to afford housing in the first place. 





With a functioning transportation system anchored by fast, frequent, subway, light rail, and commuter rail options  plus bikefriendly and walkable neighborhoods, community fears about developments' traffic impacts won't stop transitfriendly housing from being developed. And LA will be able to build the housing density around job centers needed to meet our housing challenges, making housing more affordable as supply increases to meet demand. 





Meanwhile, existing areas with more affordable options  from the San Fernando Valley to traditionally lowerincome areas across the region, will gain better access to jobs. 





And Angelenos with the newfound practical option of ditching their car and commuting by fast, efficient transit options, will see huge savings (estimated at $900/month: http://bit.ly/XFWdVk) that they can use to help them afford their housing costs.





OTHER BENEFITS


Getting LA a fullybuiltout rail system will bring huge gains in quality of life for Angelenos, dramatically changing the game for many, if not all, of the LA2050 indicators, e.g.:


* environmental quality: car dependency and sprawl leads to smog and public health problems


* income & employment: LAEDC says Measure Râ€™s transportation construction will create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9 billion over a thirty year period (PDF: http://bit.ly/14mznJk); we propose something significantly more ambitious than this, which will create magnitudes more jobs


* public safety: improving mobility would improve emergency response and free officers to attend to public safety issues instead of inching along in bumpertobumper traffic


* social consecutiveness / arts and cultural vitality: Angelenos are less likely to volunteer, participate in nonprofits, or attend arts and cultural events because traffic (and lack of rail alternatives) makes getting there so onerous. 


","Los Angeles will no longer be the laughing stock of the nation  our infamous deficiencies will be wiped clean, replaced by Los Angeles version 2.0: a revamped region with ubiquitous, intensely used rail transit, leading to dramatic increases in housing availability near job centers and to easy access to affordable housing. In short, Los Angeles will be able to join the ranks of world class cities, by tackling headon our most dysfunctional problem.


<br><br>


Now, crippling traffic gridlock (with no competitive transit alternatives in most areas) means that Angelenos' intensely fight new housing construction, including density near jobs centers and affordable housing projects. These problems will fade away. New housing developments   including dense developments near rail stations with affordable housing components  will be built near jobs centers, given the new capacity that a rail system will bring. As the housing supply increases to meet demand, prices will fall.  Meanwhile, Angelenos who choose to live further out in more affordable areas won't have to face hellish car commutes, finally getting hugely improved commuter rail options. (But make no mistake, the main purpose of a rail system won't be to encourage more sprawl, but rather to allow more Angelenos to be able to have and afford housing closer to job centers.)


<br><br>


Angelenos' transportation costs will be dramatically decreased as public transit becomes widely adopted, freeing up family budgets to be better able to afford housing in the first place.


<br><br>


Not to mention, with a fully built out subway/light rail system and ample commuter rail options Los Angeles will be a dramatically more livable place, with faster mobility and improved environmental quality. Bikeable and walkable communities will support public health goals.


<br><br>


In the meantime, we will have make a big impact on income and employment issues, too, by creating hundreds of thousands of wellpaying construction jobs over the decades leading up to 2050.  (LAEDC notes that the less ambitious Measure R construction will create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9 billion over its thirty year period http://bit.ly/14mznJk).


<br><br>


In short, Los Angeles will be a livable region. Angelenos will actually be able to get around quickly and easily, access ample new housing options, and have a dramatically improved quality of life."
3102014,2013014,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Tunnel-Art-Walk.html,Cypress Village Underground Tunnel Art Walk Gallery and Economic Vitality ,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"My idea is to convert the existing underground tunnel walk way into a flourishing community Art walk gallery for the neighborhood of Cypress Park, Los Angeles. The Tunnel project will be the first time this innovative arts undertaking will make use of the abandoned entity and bring life into this amazing area in the north east of Los Angeles. The Arts and Cultural vitality indicator is the greatest and most innovated idea to reach our city by 2050 and beyond. The ability to reuse empty space and renovate the community essense, along with progress of such. After three years lobbying to our local officials to listen to our proposal I was given the green light to make this event happen every month on our designated art walk night. 


The plan is to eventually permanently secure the closure of  Loreto street, half ways in order to create an astounding culdesac and a public street plaza for the 1,600 children in the area and local residents to enjoy. Our mission is to have the old underground (existing) tunnel be converted into a beautiful full blown Arts Gallery, opened to the public and exhibit local artist within. 


This (event) idea is the first of its kind in Los Angeles and will also be the pilot program to convert all existing city tunnels into arts spaces in the many different communities around the city and eventually county. We are leading and paving the road for the arts in the Los Angeles and also the same road for economic development via Galleries and artsy Coffee houses and cafes.


The project is to attract artist from all walks of life and it is to bring people of all economic classes to either observe, cherish, or contribute to the working artist by acquiring their works at 100 percent commission. We believe in networking and marketing greatness, for the sole reason of progress, community and sustainability by 2050 and beyond.


In conclusion, I have spend the last 8 years of my life building, creating and a great sense of passion in my beautiful community of Cypress Park. I believe profoundly in the Arts and its vitality because I'm a product of such, I am a community Artist with a successful coffeehouse dedicated to the sustainable progress of destroying blight and enhancing the neighborhood with amazing murals and art shows. It has been wonderful to come to work and network with many others who believe in a common goal and work hard to make it a reality. Our team strives on a daily basis to make a positive impact and it shows on the faces of our local youth, they love us! Lets give them and ourselves 2050 as a gift to cherish and beyond. Thank you.","Best Coffee Roaster 2007

Community involvement and volunteerism 


A great community role model for the 1,600 school children, who attend the two LAUSD across the street from us.


And many more to come in the future..... ","The non profit L A Works is going to send us roughly about 50 volunteers to renovate, clean, paint and maintain the tunnel. We will also be working with Fine Arts Solutions a for profit business known as the best high end Arts Framing and mounting company in the world. Its an actual honor to be working with them. Palm Communities has agreed to sponsor the events for the next 20 years, maybe we can convince them to add another 20 years to the deal. Attack Marketing, INC has also committed to sponsoring and getting involved with us as a community partner for this historic project.  Last but certainly not least, is our local neighborhood council who have approved our beginning seed money for this event to be successful, thank you everyone!  ","Our evaluation of success is measured by the current response of community supporters. After the first actually event, we will be able to identify the pros and the cons. Before the end of the year, we will be able to appreciate the success of such project. But as of now, I believe the project is being successful due the buzz we have received from local city officials and the department of cultural affairs. Of course our current mission is to create a non profit in order to maximize our utility, for now we are applying as the For Profit entity. 


I can only imagine, just like John Lennon and be that dreamer. I created a successful coffeehouse in the neighborhood and it has grown to be the most influential place east of the Los Angeles River. I have a dream and an aspiration that this historic project will take off and influence the rest of the city and the world. My measurement of success is an A+.","The Cypress Village Underground Tunnel Art walk, will have amny benefits for the great city. It will be the pilot program and example on how to utilize an existing historic relic. The media exposure is arming up with confirmations of local media and some main stream media buzz. This grant will enable us to secure its success rate and to expand the concept into different parts of the city and county as well. The economic resonance will vibrate far beyond 2050, because it will allow our city to flourish in the arts above other cities. We lack green space/ parks and this project will guaranteed we create our own community park in the middle of an asphalt street, formerly used to carry cars. Our city is becoming a bike commuting society and the bike corrals installed on the stretch will allow us to promote the new lifestyle. In fact, we have already reduced crime on the corridor by eliminating blight and bringing in trendy awesome community minded businesses and people to help organize the forth coming event.","Thirty seven years ago in 2013 a seed was planted in this great beautiful community of Cypress Village along the Arroyo Seco River. It was formerly known as Cypress Park and before that, the Tongva Indians inhabited the area they called home, today it is the epicenter of a sustainable Arts District in the city of Los Angeles. We would love to honor these pioneers today with an amazing collage and dedication ceremony. 


Friends, everything begins with an idea, then you believe in the idea and viola....its created!"
3102015,2013015,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/apiequalityeyetoeye.html,Eye to Eye LGBTQ Organizing Center, Social Connectedness,"Our goal is to create a center for communitybuilding, political education, action and organizing in Los Angeles, particularly for women and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ) communities of color.   This project will recruit and develop new community leaders who can participate in organizing efforts and who will be engaged in community change work.





In the short term, we will increase community activism, including voter engagement through basic outreach and education on critical issues affecting our community.  In the longer term, our goal is to develop individual and collective leadership among communities that are currently underrepresented in decisionmaking circles. These include LGBTQ people of color, LGBTQ immigrants, women and transgender people of color.  We are creating a gathering space and space for organizing and political education for these communities.","In 8 years, our organization has grown into one of the most wellestablished organizations dedicated to organizing and political engagement of LGBT people of color.  We are one of the largest nonservicebased groups, based on staff size and member involvement, representing Asian and Pacific Islander LGBT people.  We have a robust volunteer base of hundreds of activists and 5 standing committee, which plan and execute a yearround calendar of activities.  The creation of this space and organization in itself is perhaps our greatest achievement, since prior to our existence there was not an organization dedicated to political empowerment of API LGBT people.  Along with our allies, we provide an important foundation for further organizing in LGBT communities of color.","We work in a collaborative called Q*POC (Queer People of Color Alliance) who will be partners with us.  This alliance includes Latino Equality Alliance and Gender Justice LA.  As an API organization, we prioritize collaboration with other communities of color.  We also have very close working relationships with numerous LGBT organizations in LA and throughout CA and the nation, who may provide insight and resources as this project continues to develop.","We will measure our success by the number of people we engage and the number of activities we execute.  We will evaluate qualitatively the impact of our programming.  In addition, we will seek and independent consultant with community organizing experience to help evaluate our work and impact. ","This project will provide a space for organizing, education, selfempowerment, communitybuilding, and collection action among LA's community members, who are often underrepresented in our city's circles of power.  By institutionalizing programs for political education, leadership development and ongoing civic engagement, our project will amplify the voices and political power of LGBT people in communities of color, including and particularly women. 





In the course of a year, we expect to recruit and provide workshops or other opportunities to over 200 individuals, with the goal of sustaining the involvement of at least 30 who will invest in the ongoing development of the center.  We will explore the possibility of establishing an independent center and community space.  This work is currently led by our existing organization, staff and steering committee, and housed within a broader agency.  Ultimately, we believe there is a need and a space for an autonomous space that can continue to evolve and a political organizing center.





Los Angeles has a vibrant social justice movement and community of activists.  Our goal is to increase the active involvement and influence of LGBTQ people of color and women in our community's collective efforts to improve the city.  By organizing this community to address their lives at the intersections of race, gender and sexuality, we believe we can help organize a more inclusive and effective movement for change. 


","By 2050, we will have established a wellknown and stable foundation for community empowerment in LGBT communities of color, with an intersectional analysis and action plan to address the multiple challenges this community faces.  LGBT people of color in LA, propelled by their involvement in our center, will occupy decisionmaking positions and will collectively be spearheading efforts to improve our communities.  Robust voter engagement would be a given and strategic organizing projects would be the norm in our communities.  "
3102016,2013016,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/arcexperience.html,MyARC: A digital social network that solves educational challenges one project at a time., Education,"MyArc is a flexible, contentagnostic digital media platform developed explicitly for educational purposes. It presents a secure, closed ecosystem in which students can connect with other students, both at their own school and outside; engage with industry experts, community leaders and academics; create and share projects and ideas; receive project or assignment feedback from students, teachers, and other members of the community; earn, collect and award badges in recognition of a broad spectrum of activities and achievements otherwise unrecognized by standard educational reward systems. 





MyARC builds bridges between individuals, classrooms, and schools. It connects inschool and afterschool curriculum and facilitates the involvement of the larger community in the education process. It does all this by adapting the capabilities of the Web 2.0 social networking platforms to reframe the way we approach education and consider its constraints.





Current educational programs, problems, and solutions, are based around and limited by the physical structures and geographic locations of schools. Experiments in higher education and the digital humanities have shown ways to use the Internet for educational purposes, but the students who would most benefit from such innovation (i.e. those in LAâ€™s public school system) do not yet benefit from these practices. Yes, our students have access to technological tools and, often, even training on how to use them. But they are not able to use the Internet as the social network towards curricular learning. Web 2.0 has shown that the Internet is not just a place to get information; it is also, and perhaps more powerfully, a means of making connections between human beings, a tool for building communities and producing knowledge collaboratively. 





Social networking sites such as Facebook are rightly banned from school computers in order to protect our children. But what if these networks could be safely put to use in the education of our children? What if we could build a safe, protected online social network that fostered such activity as learning and extended classroom curriculum by connecting teachers, students, and communities across geographic locations? What if we could use the Internet to do what it was intended to do: to connect geographic sites and share information in ways that strengthen community? We can. It is called MyARC.





MyARC adapts the strengths of the Web to serve the needs of our public high schools and afterschools in a safe and manageable way. Students create their own profiles and participate in â€œactivities,â€ â€œclubs,â€ and â€œchallenges.â€ They elect to join â€œclubsâ€ based on their interests and to participate in â€œactivitiesâ€ and â€œchallenges.â€ They communicate with other students around a shared interest or project. They can also read, research, and review educational tools and resources related to their topic so that MyArc serves as


a virtual meeting place, a workshop, a research hub, an exhibition space, and an archive of collaborative process. 





Letâ€™s take an extended and easily implementable example: students participating in afterschool robotics clubs across Los Angeles. Students login to the â€œRobotics Clubâ€ space of MyARC and ask questions, share ides, comment on each otherâ€™s projects, and even work collaboratively but remotely. Teachers can oversee this correspondence and craft curriculum around it, building in challenges and badges. Experts from the community can login to follow the progress of this student robotics group. Local engineers or science professors can provide advice and encouragement, suggesting links to related topics or articles for further study. Local technology companies can offer prizes or post internship opportunities to the robotics club. As a result, an afterschool program in innercity Los Angeles will have access to human capital, resources, and networking opportunities usually reserved for the privileged and few. 





We need funding to build MyARC. We have already designed the interface and most of its functionality. We need support to build and betatest the prototype. Though our pilot is targeted towards high school students, we are designing the tool to be scalable and flexible so as to support diverse learning communities. The webspace will be secure and protected; content will be monitored for accuracy by experts residing both within the ARC team and on an extended Advisory Board (see partners). We are in a unique position of being able to easily implement the platform once it is built because MyARC will be supported and implemented by ARC: an afterschool and experiential education provider (see section below).





MyARC provides a central hub for learners, educational institutions, and other organizations to share, exhibit, and learn. MyARC is a digital social network, a safe space for projectbased learning that solves educational challenges one project and one student at a time. 


","ARC provides comprehensive, afterschool programming for over 23,000 student participants annually: 6 Elementary Schools, 6 Middle Schools, 21 High Schools and more than 80 other schools with LEAD Programming. ARC also collaborates with over 275 youth based, community, organizationsâ€”from unified school districts, charter schools, park and recreation departments to religious youth groups, independent schools, YMCAâ€™s, Boys and Girls Clubs, sports clubs, and other youth development organizations. 


        


In twelve years, we have grown from two staff members to over 170 whose individual diversity models the diversity of our LAbased student population. Our awardwinning afterschool and Leadership, Experience, Adventure & Development (LEAD) programs have made a difference in the lives of thousands of students in lowincome communities in Southern California, created authentic partnerships with schools and closed the opportunity gap for all our kids.  





Some standout accolades are:





ARC was selected for inclusion in the US Department of Educationâ€™s â€œBest Practicesâ€ resource book for older youth after school programs (2010).


ARC was awarded the â€œCalifornia After School Network Innovators Award for Collaborationâ€


LAUSDâ€™s Beyond the Bell Branch nominated ARC for the Federal Doing What Works in OST website.


In 2009 the League of CA After School Partners highlighted ARC's partnership with Beyond the Bell as a best practices team. 


ARC was a runner up for the 2010 Loadstone National Collaboration Prize


A 2009 independent evaluation found that ARC students are 12% more likely to pass the CAHSEE exam then their nonARC counterparts.


ARC developed the successful Take Action Leadership Campaign: a collaboration of Los Angeles School District  Beyond the Bell Branch, after school providers, and community organizations within Southern California united around a common desire to give students leadership skills, celebrate the arts, serve our communities, and empower students to mentor their peers.  http://takeactionleadershipcampaign.org


ARC developed The Teen Adventure Challenge (now in its fifth year) http://www.teenadventurechallenge.com


ARC partnered with CORE and USCâ€™s Writing Program to develop â€œSOS College,â€ a website that helps underserved students, grades 812, access information about college entrance applications.  http://college.sosclassroom.org/


In 2009, two of the four ARC After School Executive Managers were honored by the CA School Age Consortium for excellence in program design and site management.


ARC's partnership with CORE Educational Services has brought significant private sector money to our ASSETS sites from companies such as Home Depot, State Farm, Bain Capital, Leichtag Foundation, Sound Body Sound Mind, Parsi Accounting, Whole Foods, and many more. 


","ARC is a primary after school provider for the Green Dot Public Schools and LAUSD. These partnerships and others will serve MyARC, including EduCare Foundation, Impact People, Inner City Education Foundation, Youth Policy Institute, Woodcraft Rangers, Boys and Girls Club, Alliance Schools, and KYDS. The Learning in Afterschool and Summer Initiative and Youtopia are partners in the â€œBadgeâ€ development.  Professor Mark Marino (USC), Professor Jessica Pressman (UCSD), Professor Jeremy Douglass (UCSB): Recipients of an American Council of Learned Societies â€œCollaborative Fellowshipâ€ (20122013) will connect MyARC with academia. 


","Our metrics for measuring the success of this project will be, as they are in any pedagogical effort, both quantitative and qualitative. We will track numbers: the number of students, teachers and other stakeholder who sign on to participate in the pilot; and how much does that number grows over time; the amount of time individual users stay on the site; and more. We will also pursue interpretative evaluations to determine what types of activities are most engaging; which activities attract the most users and which demand the most involvement? We will also use user surveys to track attitudinal shifts about learning to see how students perceive the success of MyARC as it emerges. Finally, we will work with our partnersâ€”teachers, administrators, and educational foundations to determine appropriate metrics for tracking connections between use of MyARC and student test scores, job applications and acceptances, college admission rates, etc.  Success will be measured in datasheets and individual narratives, statistics and quotations. ","Make LA a better place by making connections between students across the city and remapping the LAâ€™s educational network. Funding MyARC will sow the seeds for its continued development via and through LAâ€™s youth. They will take over its development and operations, guided by the ARC staff, our partners, and, eventually, an emergent network located across LA and based around its public school system. 





MyArc will make LA a better place by forging connections between students, schools, curricula, private enterprise and diverse neighborhoods within the city. The Web has been touted as having the power to connect, to democratize, and to bridge geographical locations into a global village. That potential has been largely withheld from LAâ€™s neediest students in our public schools. But we need to confront and tackle the obstacles to employing digital social networking in education. MyARC does that by proceeding with deep knowledge of current trends in the digital humanities, education reform, and the actual operations of LAUSD, Green Dot, and other LEAs (see our partners).





We must refocus education on connections not constraints. MyARC will connect students across LAUSD; it will invite the private sector to support and fund education via MyARCâ€™s online challenges and rewards; it will support the development of an LAbased youth workforce by providing practical, skillbased and projectbased learning. Zooming out to larger impacts of this project on LA, we can foresee an investment in our digitalbased program for alternative education as striking a match that illuminates LA as a creative destination for education reformrelated industries.





By connecting these individual nodes into a larger LAbased network, MyARC reforms the social network that is Los Angeles. It connects and benefits individual students, teachers, classrooms, schools, afterschool programs, and the community at large. Building a platform to harness the powers of the digital network for the good of LAâ€™s public school students is good for LA. The students of today are, of course, the future of LA in 2050 and beyond.


","With a simple technological platform and a management staff to properly implement the site and ensure student safety, MyARC can facilitate a meaningful transformation in the educational landscape of LA. We can inject passion, play, and participation into education just by creatively utilizing the tools and social networking skills already in existence. We can build ways for students to want to share ideas, discover new subjects, and learn about different areas of expertise. We can facilitate ways for the larger Los Angeles community to participate in public education, by sharing expertise and supporting teachers and by rewarding projectbased competitions. With MyARC, we take action to change the present state of education. By building a virtual network that will serve LAâ€™s real network of students, schools, and communities, we seek to facilitate to improve the educational futures of LA youth and, along with them, LAâ€™s future as well.

3102017,2013017,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/artsharela.html,Creative Placemaking in Downtown L.A.,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"With your support, Art Share L.A. will rebuild its organizational plan and restructure its culture to adopt a model conducive to creative placemaking, serving as a case study in the advancements of mixeduse creative live/work centers throughout Los Angeles. 





As defined by the National Endowment for The Arts, creative placemaking is â€œwhen partners from the public, private, nonprofit and community sectors strategically shape the physical and social character of a neighborhood, town, city or region around cultural activities. Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces, rejuvenates structures and streetscapes, improves local business viability and public safety, and brings diverse people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired.â€ 





This process detailed in the NEAâ€™s report on creative placemaking occurred organically and uninstitutionalized in the eastern outskirts of downtown Los Angeles during the mid80â€™s. Sandwiched between Skid Row, Little Tokyo and the Los Angeles River, artists and creative individuals set up shop and home in vacated warehouses. As the economic and cultural impact of creativity on the neighborhood began to show, more formalized arts organization and institutions began to developâ€”Art Share L.A. among them. The industrial warehouse area outside Downtown was renamed the Arts District and the neighborhood experienced a major demographic shift: more creative individuals began to inhabit the area, creating a flourishing neighborhood of art, music, culture, and true autonomy.





In a typical pattern of gentrification, the migration of wealth and infrastructure development attracted to the area began displacing the creative individuals that had worked to make the community inhabitable, and the informal centers that housed the creative placemakers began to disappear. Property and land developers set their sites on reclaiming the neighborhood, and in a period of 10 years, property values skyrocketed from an estimated $.25/sq. ft. to over $2/sq. ft. for newly modeled â€œartists loftsâ€, in reality simply luxury apartments with creative branding affixed.





The need for buildings like Art Share L.A. in the downtown area is high, as is the risk that they will suffer the same fate of many informal art and cultural centers in the area. Our goal is to create a new model of community living, fitting the creative placemaking definition; through education and community engagement we will work to create new live/work centers throughout Los Angeles County. Our first step in this process is rebranding and reestablishing the organizational structure at Art Share L.A. to create a sustainable and equitable communityrun model. The second is to produce a public resource document to those seeking to create similar live/work artist run centers.





This project will impact Arts and Cultural Vitality by creating immediate opportunities for meaningful engagement in the artsâ€”leading to longterm sustainability. During the 7month project, Art Share L.A. will create: 


â€¢	610 parttime entrylevel and supplemental employment opportunities 


â€¢	A WorkExchange Program for presenters without access to capital


â€¢	A formalized Program Board for communal review and assessment of proposed classes, events and partnerships


â€¢	A team of consultants to work with the staff, Program Board and Board of Directors to assist with coherency in areas of the marketing, development and assessment processes necessary for sustaining the model





Projected longterm benefits of the project will include a sustainable, accessible livework/multiuse facility, as defined by the governing principles of creative placemaking, capable of housing and supporting artists in their professional development, now and in the future. Additionally, sustained activity works to enhance the overall quality and livability of neighborhoods surrounding downtown Los Angeles, most specifically, the Arts District. Art Share L.A. will support its local artists while enhancing the quality of life throughout downtown Los Angeles. ","For over a decade, Art Share L.A. has provided 30affordable live/work units in the booming Downtown Arts District, supporting hundreds of artists including Grammy Awardwinning DJ, Sonny Moore (more commonly known as Skrillex). 





In the mid2000â€™s, the facilities thrived as a center for atrisk youthâ€”servings over 300 students per year. During this time frame, Art Share L.A. created its FACT program (Families and Communities Together). This program, created in collaboration with Stevenson Middle School in Boyle Heights and the LA County Probation Department, has helped families in crises for 8 yearsâ€”pairing trained social workers with families in creative and expressive environments to explore conscious and constructive problemsolving skills. 





The economic downturn of 2008 hit Art Share L.A. in an almost devastating manner. The organization and its management struggled to make ends meet. By the summer of 2011, all staff had been cut and the agency was operating on a shoestring budget. Property buyout offers were on the table, but the new board of directors was dedicated to keeping Art Share L.A. owned and operated by and for the community. The new directors, under guidance of city planner, Elizabeth Peterson, brought the facilities into a new era, complete with new paint job and new staff. 





In the summer of 2012, Art Share L.A. ventured on a partnership that would bridge the worlds of outdoor advertising and street artâ€”two sectors who until recently have rivaled for public space and the rights to it. In March of 2013, Art Share L.A. (in collaboration with Casey Zoltan of Known Gallery and 15 of the cities most renowned street artists) launched the second installment of the project. Since inception in 2012, more than twodozen street artists have legally showcased on billboards through a rotating citywide gallery exhibit. 





Currently, Art Share L.A. is pursuing the creation of on going immersive and interactive art experiences through digital augment reality platforms like Aurasma in partnership with ceramic street artist, Zenka. We will create interactive, augmented reality ceramic art installations in the Arts District. 


","Over the past year, Art Share L.A. has developed relationships with numerous art collectives, presenting organizations and related nonprofit groups including contemporary music presenter, Iridian Arts; experimental music collective, the wulf; California Lawyers for the Arts; youth enrichment programs, CitySTAGE  and the Academy of Creative Education as well as LAbased ensemble wildUp. 





Longstanding community partnerships include groups such as Padua Playwrights, Cornertstone Theater, the Los Angeles River Artists and Business Association (LARABA) and the Los Angeles Downtown Arts District Space (LADADspace).","Art Share L.A. will need to first assess its current organization structure and pool information into a central database. We will compile data including: 


â€¢	Current donors (June 2012present) and prospective donors


â€¢	Current community partners


â€¢	Current artists roster


â€¢	Current number of volunteers, event attendees and students


â€¢	Current promotional mechanisms


â€¢	Current outreach mechanisms


â€¢	Level of accessibility (community survey) 


â€¢	Quality of events (community survey) 





Our primary goal is to achieve program sustainability: by compiling the previous 12 months of program data and understanding Art Share L.A.â€™s current effectiveness and reach, we are better able to gauge project success.





The project will be evaluated by asking the following questions at the completion of the


 project:


â€¢	Did the organization achieve its marketing efforts in reaching the number of rental hours and classes needed to sustain the parttime jobs created during the project?


â€¢	Does our organization have a student base and model for promoting new classes?


â€¢	Did employees perform well and respond positively to the organizational culture?


â€¢	Was the organization successful in recruiting and maintaining meaningful relationships with volunteers through the work exchange program? How many onetime volunteers? How many 25 times? How many volunteering regularly?


â€¢	Is there a clear marketing and social media mechanism in place? Is there one person from each management level (staff, program board and board of directors) trained to execute? 


â€¢	Is there a clear development strategy in place? Is there one person from each management level (staff, program board and board of directors) trained to execute?





At projectâ€™s end, we compile and compare data sets, and identify trends: attendance, audience feedback, schedule density, and donor participation to gauge our capacity and growth for 2014 and beyond.


","This project serves to enhance the lives of hundreds each year by creating jobs, access to affordable housing, and providing spatial resources specifically for the support of artists and their creative processes. It will keep balance between residents, artists, officials, developers and business owners by giving a common ground for discussion, education, community gatherings, social and commercial connectivity. 





The creation of similar centers throughout Los Angeles will disseminate like values and opportunities for other communities, based on their specific needs. This will have a direct impact on each key indicator mentioned in the LA2050 Report. 





â€¢	Education â€“ Studies conducted by the California Alliance for Arts Education show that arts education engages students in learning and helps prepare our youth to meet expectation of the 21st century workforce. By offering arts education outside the K12 system, we encourages lifelong learning. 


â€¢	Income and Employment â€“ Art Shareâ€™s proposed model creates ongoing, entrylevel jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. Proven to revitalize local economies, Art Share L.A. will attract new businesses, new tourists and new commerceâ€”creating jobs across multiple sectors. 


â€¢	Housing â€“ Development of centers like Art Share L.A. increases access to creative and affordable live/work/rehearsal space. Art Share L.A. contributes 30live/work lofts to the market.  


â€¢	Environmental Quality â€“ If we can lessen the need for daytoday travel while increasing public transportation, we will see a significantly stronger impact in our environmental quality. As neighborhoods develop around their respective creative centers, the need to travel for basic amenities and entertainment will decrease. 


â€¢	Public Safety â€“ As people take ownership over their communities and begin connecting with one another through participation in artistic and cultural activities, official or unofficial â€˜neighborhood watchâ€™ goes into effect. Studies show that participants in cultural events and activities are more likely to be civically engagedâ€”enabling them to organize and function stronger as communities. 


â€¢	Social Connectedness â€“ Through the Work Exchange program, we encourage volunteerism in the community and give opportunity for everyone to feel valued and involved in the arts. Art is often intertwined with political, environmental and larger societal issues. By nature of association, residents participating in cultural activities will be more aware and more socially connected. 


â€¢	Arts and Cultural Vitality â€“ Creation of such art centers throughout Los Angeles will provide access to physical space for creation and an intangible system of support that nurtures artistic endeavors by providing local touring networks and monetizable opportunities. 


","In 2050, every neighborhood will have creative live/work community art centers. Those who have dedicated their life to the study of art and refinement of creative processes will not only live among our neighborhoods in designated lowincome artist housing, but thrive within them. 





Centers like Art Share L.A. will inspire and nurture young artists, provide support for working artists and create communitybased educational opportunitiesâ€”all collectively working to shift a culture where, as Mike David states in City of Quartz, â€œeveryone is either on a corporate payroll or waiting hopefully at the studio gate.â€  





The arts will flourish and help to unify and strengthen communities across the nation. Local artists will have fair and equitable exhibition space with the opportunity to sell work, teach classes and collaborate on projects in communal workspace. Musicians, playwrights, directors, producers, dancers and other performing artists will have access to a venue at affordable rates (free under the Work Exchange Program), allowing them to generate revenue through their live performances. Artists will have the choice of living in whatever community they choose, with a network of venues to tour and develop audiences county, state and national markets, and the ability to feel autonomy, mastery and purpose in their work. Emerging artists will have places to live while they develop their creative and entrepreneurial skill sets; they will have access to facilities and opportunities to connect with other creative professionals.

3102018,2013018,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ALOT.html,The A LOT Initiative: Using Art to Activate Vacant City Lots,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Our A LOT Initiative will foster a stronger community identity, a sense of place, and revitalize economic development by way of supporting creative activity. Free events will promote the concept of creative placemaking, encouraging our community to animate public and private spaces, rejuvenate streetscapes, improve local business viability and public safety, while bringing together diverse people to celebrate, to inspire, and to be inspired. The A Lot Initiative will begin in Fall 2013.








A LOT's primary goal is to broaden audience and artist engagement, as well as, expand geographic scope, with underserved communities especially benefiting. Rather than placing cultural activities in enclosed venues for a limited number of people for a couple of hours, the objective is to enliven vacant lots, streets, and entire areas with creative energy  sound, light, visual art, and performance  for days or even weeks at a time. In addition to engaging residents in the arts, A LOT is intended to increase pedestrian traffic and enliven streets with vacant storefronts, thus creating prospects for both ""popup"" and more permanent businesses to revitalize these neighborhoods. The projects' mobility is intended to offer this transformative opportunity to multiple neighborhoods creating lasting impact throughout the city.","Recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Our Town Grant for $150,000. The Arts Council was one of 80 organizations selected from a pool of 317 applicants.  And, 1 of 6 organizations to receive the highest amount.  The Arts Council serves over 2500 students each year in the Arts Learning program. Every October, Long Beach Arts Month promotes over 500 events for National Arts and Humanities Month in Long Beach. This calendar reaches over 100,000 people all over Los Angeles. On average each year, the Arts Council distributes over 40 grants to artists and community based nonprofit arts organizations. 


","A LOT aims to serve lowincome residents by linking arts and culture participation with the mission of redevelopment, helping to revitalize economicallychallenged neighborhoods with worldclass performances that will increase social and economic activity. Because of these shared goals, the project is being planned and implemented as a partnership between ACLB and Long Beach Development Services, a local government agency. Other partners in this effort include local neighborhood associations and groups, as well as business improvement districts throughout the city.","The primary intended outcome of the project is that the Long Beach and Los Angeles County will be strengthened through the arts. A secondary outcome is public engagement with diverse and excellent art. Quantitative performance measurements of both outcomes will include the numbers of performances, artists, audiences, locations, and neighborhoods that participate. In addition to the quantitative performance measurements, the Arts Council for Long Beach will work with its primary partner, Long Beach Development Services, to evaluate the qualitative impact of the project on the communities involved. The partners will assess the level of increased social and economic vitality in areas where performances take place, such as reduction of blight; businesses opened in vacant storefronts; new gathering spaces; positive reporting in the media; and increase in membership in neighborhood and block associations. The partners will also work with the community to gather to anecdotal evidence of change, such as increase in neighborhood pride; and greater interaction of cultures and ethnic groups. This information will be gathered through surveys and interviews with key staff of the partners and leaders of the community. ","Arts Council for Long Beach and its partners have embarked on a unique, initiative that blends arts participation with community redevelopment. The A LOT Initiative  will improve the vitality of traditionally underserved neighborhood and enliven the areas through arts participation. A LOT encourages the presence and participation in cultural opportunities by bringing art into communities. It furthers support of cultural participation by creating art opportunities in areas where previously there was limited to no access to the arts. A LOT allows new audiences to experience art in their neighborhood. While the current structure and focus of the initiative  is on underserved neighborhoods and residents in the Long Beach area, the project's concepts can be applied throughout the region.  ","In 2050, A LOTâ€™s success will be seen throughout Los Angeles as vacant lots become cultural hubs bringing communities together. These spaces will transform the cultural landscape of communities building arts participation and engaging audiences. All LA residents will have access to highquality performances and arts experiences in their own neighborhoods, but also people from throughout the region can visit other neighborhoods and communities to experience art there, thus breaking down some of the geographic barriers that currently segregate LA economically and culturally. Arts will also be a primary consideration in civic planning, development, and transportation.  "
3102019,2013019,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CreativeCapitalLA.html,Creative Capital: A campaign for a healthy & prosperous Los Angeles,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Creative Capital LA: a campaign for a healthy and prosperous Los Angeles County.





Creative Capital LA is a public campaign to leverage the public investment in arts and culture to produce a successful and thriving Los Angeles County. With more and more research (LA2050, Otis Report, LA Stage Allianceâ€™s Arts Census) showing that a robust arts & culture core reaps advances in education, business, and civic life, we are committed to supporting a future in which arts & culture are an essential part of the solution to building Americaâ€™s Creative Capital â€“ this year, and every year, to 2050 and beyond.





Los Angeles has long been a beacon for big thinkers, dreamers, and innovators.  We are the home of the second largest community of artists in the United States, the center of the film and music industries, the home for 5,000 fashion firms, and the epicenter of a creative movement building â€œSilicon Beachâ€ alongside a vibrant core of creative small businesses. Now, all of usâ€”educators, artists, lawmakers, business owners, creative workers, and arts lovers can unite under a single banner tailored for our individual neighborhood, community, or city, one that pulls us all together to complete the unique mosaic of creativity that is Los Angeles County.





To launch Creative Capital LA, Arts for LA proposes a public engagement campaign to identify and celebrate the ways â€œCreative Capitalâ€ defines Los Angeles County. For the campaign, Creative Capital can be understood as a noun: a person, place, or thing.





â€¢	CREATIVE CAPITAL is a person who creates or innovates.





â€¢	CREATIVE CAPITAL is a place that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and embraces the imagination.





â€¢	CREATIVE CAPITAL is a thing that enables creation or innovation (technology, infrastructure, materials like paint or musical instruments, public policies).








Creative Capital LA will provide online tools and materials for individuals and groups to actively engage with each other, with their own communities, and with the 10 million residents of Los Angeles County. 








We will ask people to submit images (or videos) of people, places, and things with one of three captions: â€œI Am Creative Capitalâ€; â€œWe Are Creative Capitalâ€; and â€œLos Angeles is Creative Capital.â€ The range of possible images will reflect the diversity and creativity of Los Angeles: a child learning to play a violin, a class of middle school students working on a mural at their school, church choirs, dance groups, an architect in front of Disney Hall, book festivals, film crews, a fashion show by emerging designers, and so on.








The collection of images will translate the concept of â€œCreative Capitalâ€ into a visual representation that will instill pride, inspiration, and social connection among those who call Los Angeles County home. 








The impact of this campaign on the indicator of Arts & Culture Vitality will be both personal and collective. Those who participate in Creative Capital LA will be engaged to express their commitment to and participation in arts and culture, and those who view these expressions will, in turn, be inspired and possibly motivated to engage themselves in the arts. Collectively, Los Angeles will generate an atmosphere to strengthen our arts & culture ecology and will signal to the rest of the country, and the world, how an abundance of creativity and innovation can produce a successful and thriving city.


","Our 2012 Annual Report and a comprehensive list of our organizational benchmarks are available at www.artsforla.org. Our work demonstrates the impact of advocacy by parents, students, teachers, small business owners, and government, corporate, and private foundation supporters. During 2012, 4,538 unique arts advocates sent 16,259 letters to policymakers through the Arts for LA website on 12 local campaigns. 





Our most recent advocacy success was the unanimous passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution by the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) on October 9, 2012. The resolution affirms and protects arts education as core curriculum, like science and math, and its impact has been nationwide. Arts for LA has been contacted by education advocates in New York City and Chicago who want to pursue similar resolutions for their districts. This success is even more remarkable considering that in December 2011, LAUSD had announced its plans to eliminate arts education for elementary students in response to budget cuts. Throughout the spring of 2012, Arts for LA devoted its communication platform to generate public awareness of the issue, and our efforts resulted in 4,928 letters to LAUSDâ€™s school board members and Superintendent Dr. John Deasy, PhD. In June, LAUSD reached an agreement that restored arts education for elementary school students, which laid the foundation for passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution.





The success of our campaigns has demonstrated the value and role of advocacy, not only for arts and culture groups, but for nonprofits of all disciplines. In 2012, the Los Angeles City Admin. Office recommended the city abolish a program that allows a number of nonprofits to pay $1 rent per year on cityowned buildings, instead of market rate rent. This measure would save the city $3 million, but endanger, if not eliminate, the nonprofits that provide health, arts, education, conservation, and other human services to vulnerable populations. 





Arts for LA rallied arts organizations and other community stakeholders such as LA Conservation Corps, ONE Generation, People Coordinated Services, West LA FamilySource Center, and others. Through the Arts for LA communications platform, over 3,000 advocates wrote to the LA City Council urging them to require a public hearing, including an economic impact statement on the nonprofit infrastructure. The City Council agreed, and the proposal has not been pursued since our stakeholders took action.





Campaigns such as this have generated thoughtful responses to advocates from public officials, while the focus on positive, solutionsbased advocacy has earned the organization and its network of advocates the respect of local policymakers, who are increasingly willing to meet with organizational leadership. Arts for LA believes these indicators point to a more engaged and empowered creative community, and policymakers who are recognizing the role of arts & culture in the health of the region.


","In its advocacy campaigns, Arts for LA has worked with:


â€¢	24,000+ email subscribers spread across Los Angelesâ€™ 88 municipalities and 81 school districts. 


â€¢	15 community teams in Burbank, Santa Monica, Culver City, Paramount, Montebello, Long Beach, Pasadena, Pomona, South Bay, Watts, Boyle Heights, Glendale, Cerritos, NorwalkMirada, and Whittier.


â€¢	Since 2009, over 550 community members have participated in our free advocacy training. 


â€¢	125 organizational members, including cornerstone institutions like the LA Philharmonic and LACMA as well as smaller, communitybased organizations such as Ignite Dance Workshops, Watts Village Theatre, and LA Jewish Symphony.","Evaluation of a public engagement campaign is complicated since a â€œwinâ€ is not as easily defined as the outcome of an election or ballot measure. Despite the intangible nature of public awareness, tangible outcomes can be measured over time.  








Participation in Creative Capital LA will be measured by:


1)	100,000 Creative Capital images 


2)	10,000 Likes on Facebook


3)	1,000 news items, across all media





Direct, successful outcomes of the Creative Capital LA campaign will be:


1)	greater access to arts and cultural experiences


2)	increased funding for arts and culture 


3)	increased jobs in the creative economy


4)	a majority of school districts offering arts education as part of a complete education.  





All of these outcomes can be measured by existing methods used by Arts for LA and other organizations (Otis, LA Stage Alliance, DCA, LACAC, NEA, etc.).


","A broad, robust, and diverse investment in arts and culture will ensure a healthy and prosperous Los Angeles. Great cities invest in arts and culture to the level they invest in infrastructure, education, business, and health. 





Creative Capital LA will generate the public support that LA2050 cites as critical to ensuring the vitality not only of arts and culture, but of the city itself.  Creative Capital LA will lead to â€œcoherent artsnurturingâ€ policies that strengthen not only the arts & culture indicator, but also several other indicators, such as Income & Employment, which will benefit from job growth in the creative economy. Creative Capital LA will expand every residentâ€™s ability to participate in arts advocacy by democratizing the tools and expanding our Social Connectedness when we recognize ourselves and our communities as â€œCreative Capitals.â€





After Arts & Culture Vitality, Education is the indicator that would be most affected by the public engagement made possible by Creative Capital LA. The majority of lowincome students have little to no access to arts education. One of the reasons arts education is so important for lowincome students is that it directly addresses the student achievement gap. Studies have shown that arts education improves literacy, numeracy, school attendance (and as a result, lowers the dropout rate), and parental engagement (Youth ARTS Development Project, 1996, U.S. Department of Justice; Arts Education Partnership, CAAE.) Atrisk students who have access to the arts in or out of school also tend to have better academic results, better workforce opportunities, and more civic engagement, according to a new NEA report, The Arts and Achievement in AtRisk Youth (2012).





By promoting arts education and its connection to 21st century skills. Creative Capital LA will increase public support for education reform and make a complete education possible for LA Countyâ€™s 1.6 million public school students. We imagine a Los Angeles County in which every young person develops the skills to succeed in our creative industries, from fashion to film, visual art to visual effects, design to drama.  And when artists, creative entrepreneurs, and forward thinkers engage with our elected officials, our collaborative thinking will push Los Angeles to the forefront of American creativity and innovation.


","Arts for LA envisions the greater Los Angeles region as one in which government, education, business and residents value, support and fully integrate the artsâ€”in all their diversityâ€”into the fabric of civic life. Arts for LA affirms that the arts are critical to a healthy, prosperous society. Access to substantive arts and cultural experiences enriches the quality of life for both residents of and visitors to the greater Los Angeles region. 





In 2050, all 81 school districts in Los Angeles County will offer a complete education â€“ that includes arts education â€“ to ensure our children develop into adults with excellent skills in communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. 





In 2050, all 88 municipalities in Los Angeles County will hold policies that support the fastest growing sector of our economy by investing resources intelligently, fostering new business growth, and including arts and culture in community and governmental leadership.





Success in 2050 will be shaped by these values:





â–ª	The arts foster civic engagement, stimulate economic activity, and increase cultural empathy, and thus play a crucial role in sustaining thriving communities.





â–ª	Every resident deserves access to a variety of arts and cultural experiences, both in the major arts institutions and in neighborhood cultural centers and programs.





â–ª	Arts education is central to the development of all children and to ongoing creative engagement for people of all ages.





â–ª	Artists and arts organizations require a social environment that values and supports their contributions and encourages excellence.





â–ª	The breadth, depth, and diversity of artistic and cultural life are critical measures of the vitality of Los Angeles.





Art is universal, democratic, and nonpartisan. It has the power to unite people, to prompt discussion, to encourage critical thinking, and to remind us of what makes us human.  An engaged democracy shares these same goals, and democracy succeeds when everyone takes responsibility to be part of the solution.  We believe artists, arts and culture leaders, and arts audiences will be part of the solution to help Los Angeles prosper and thrive.

3102020,2013020,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ArtsEarthPartnership.html,AEP  Arts and Cultural Environmental Certification, Environmental Quality,"Arts:Earth Partnership (AEP), is a Los Angeles, California based 501 (C)(3) nonprofit corporation that was organized in 2008 for the purpose of creating and administering a green business certification program specifically for cultural facilities. We are the â€œofficialâ€ administrator for the arts and cultural sector of the Los Angeles Green Business Certification Program alongside the Los Angeles Community College District, the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, and the Los Angeles Visitors and Tourism Board. AEP promotes and works with arts and cultural organizations to integrate comprehensive environmental sustainability into their operations through a certification process. AEP and its partners form a powerful network of arts and arts support organizations committed to finding solutions to the serious environmental challenges that face our communities, our city and our world.





The AEP certification process looks at 8 different areas of operations;    





â€¢ Operations and Culture


â€¢ General Practices


â€¢ Solid Waste


â€¢ Water Efficiency and Urban Runoff


â€¢ Energy Efficiency


â€¢ Chemical Use and Pollution Prevention


â€¢ Transportation


â€¢ Landscape








As the message spreads about climate change and the real dangers associated with it we realize that now is the time to make concrete changes that will create real results.  AEP is uniquely qualified to lead this effort with experts that have been trained and have a history of working with the arts and sustainability.  The sector has largely been ignored to this point and there are large opportunities to empower these facilities to make a difference and expand their mission as a cultural facility to include the environment.  No longer will they just be a theater or a gallery.  They are a theater or a gallery with a purpose and mission that includes being part of the solution and contributing positively to solutions to mitigate climate change through emissions, waste reduction, and purchasing policies.  AEP is not about waiting for others, we are leading, in action and making it happen.





â€œAccording to the US Census report of 2007 there are 124,624 active cultural and recreational facilities in the US.â€   This includes for profit and nonprofit. 





Arts and culture provide a unique connection to the general public that other commercial businesses cannot replicate. The mission of a cultural facility is to draw audience from all walks of life and as a result, they reach the broadest diversity of individuals within a community. In another 2006 survey listed in â€œCreative Capitol,â€ it notes that the audience base of arts and cultural organizations makes up a substantial 43% of the community.  In the greater Los Angeles area that is over 4 million people!


","In February of 2010, after a couple years of developing the program, honing our business model and having our checklist vetted by various entities, AEP signed a groundbreaking contract with the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs to assess and then assist all City owned cultural facilities to become green certified businesses. 





Since then we have been asked to be a part of Los Angeles official green business certification program, sharing administrative duties with the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board. AEP will assess and administer any business in the arts and culture sector (Museums, Theaters, Art Galleries, Dance Studioâ€™s, Production Offices, Arts related nonprofits and Cultural Centers.) LACCD will handle restaurants, garages and general offices and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board will handle green hotels and lodgings. Any business that goes through AEP certification will be recognized as a green business by the City of Los Angeles. We also have the exact same arrangement with the City of Santa Monica and their green business administrator Sustainable Works.  This is a powerful new system of greening businesses through nonprofits rather then city departments and is unlike any in the country or world.





To date we have 40 members in Los Angeles. You can see a full list here. http://artsearthpartnership.org/members/ 


","Los Angeles Community College District


Los Angeles Stage Alliance


Arts for LA


Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs


Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation


Electric Lodge Art and Environment Center


Council District 11 of Los Angeles


Office of Sustainability in Santa Monica


Sustainable Works


LADWP


Southern California Edison","Measuring success for AEP is easy.  The more members we have making changes to their organizations to move them towards sustainable operations and daily habits through our process the better. 


AEP can measure and track the following metrics (this is not a complete list);


âˆ† kilowatt hours saved through lighting retrofits


âˆ† gallons of water saved through plumbing and landscaping retrofits


âˆ† waste reduction through recycling and diverting the landfill


âˆ† complete elimination of toxic cleaning products


âˆ† elimination of toxic paint and chemical products


âˆ† amount of public participation and staff in using alternative transportation to get to the venue.  This creates a carbon savings.


âˆ† tons of universal waste recycled


âˆ† Stormwater runoff control ","There are many benefits to adopting sustainable practices.  At their museum, art gallery, theater or arts support organization, our member organizations save precious dollars through resource conservation that can be redirected toward fulfilling their missions. They increase productivity by creating a healthy workplace free of toxins and reduce their negative impact on our City and planet by reducing CO2 emissions, energy costs, material and water waste and set an important and visible example for their millions of audience and visitors to follow. 





In addition, the adoption of environmentally friendly business practices and attaining a city and state recognized Green Business Certification allows for positive marketing and outreach as well as an opportunity to grow a donor base to include those who champion environmentalism and earth conscious business practices. Itâ€™s a snowball effect. Our certification checklist and process has been vetted by the Santa Monica Office of Sustainability, the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, the National Resources Defense Council in Washington D.C. and by the Department of Toxic Substances Control in Sacramento, CA. the governing body that administers and approves all the green business programs operating in the State of California. 





The emergence of AEP's program has and will continue to have a demonstrably positive effect on the health and quality of life for millions of Angelenos every day and a dramatic multiplier effect for the Arts and cultural sector. By joining together hundreds of arts organizations of every aesthetic and type, in every community prosperous and financially challenged, urban and rural, we create a powerful constituency whose direct interaction with the general public can not be overstated. AEP is committed to strict and rigid data collection and will be publishing an annual Los Angeles Arts Environmental Report (LAAER) that details the membersâ€™ collective CO2 reductions, water and waste savings and other valuable information to demonstrate the actual impact of the program. This report and the positive actions of our members will have the beneficial outcome of positioning the arts sector as a leader in the emerging environmental field, making them even more attractive for private and public support. ","Success to AEP by the year 2050 is multilayered.  We see ourselves having thousands of arts and cultural facilities certified and every two years continuing to recertify.  Our Vendors Resource Guide will have continued to grow to contain hundreds of trusted environmentally sustainable companies vetted and approved by 3rd party certifications in their sectors.  We will be managing various competitions based around environmentally themed art and broken out into different categories to include high school, college and adult artists.  Plays, paintings, photography and screenplays will all be explored.





Lastly AEP will have created a policy department which will work on a municipal, state and federal level to implement guidelines for the ways we operate our buildings, purchase products, use energy/water and   the other issues contained in our certification process.  Our certification process will continue to evolve in order to create a harmonious balance between business and environment.  We can have businesses that function with the idea of the triple bottom line (people, profit and planet) and we can all live in a safer, healthier, and cleaner world.  All it takes is education, desire and action."
3102021,2013021,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SchoolMentoring.html,School Based Mentoring, Education,"Provide a school based mentoring program.  AADAP shall target children and youth ages 7 to 15 years of age. The children and youth are identified as being at risk of failing or dropping out of school, at risk of joining a gang or using drugs.








Program Goals:


1. Strengthen the social, emotional, cognitive and behavioral competencies of children living in poverty;


2. Improve the childrenâ€™s commitment to school and to academic achievement;


3. Improve the childrenâ€™s understanding of healthy standards of behavior;


4. Improve each childâ€™s resilience, self-efficacy and sense of the future; and


5. Strengthen each childâ€™s sense of self-worth.


6. Help reduce the negative impact of an absent mother or father on a childâ€™s well-being and life potential. 


  7. Help reduce the negative impact of poverty and other socio-economic stressors on childâ€™s social and emotional well-being, academic performance, and ability to develop essential life competencies.


8. Increase opportunities for every childâ€™s success in school and in life. 


9. Help youth develop self-esteem, motivation, and self-management skills to work towards high school graduation and higher education.





AADAP's School-Based Mentoring Program supports economically and educationally disadvantaged children in public elementary and middle schools with volunteer mentors who spend at least one hour per week at the school for the entire school year. The mentor and the youth meet for a one-to-one mentoring in the classroom, school library, school computer room, neighborhood community center, or other set location. They shall meet once a week to read together, play sports, play games, or simply talk about life and personal issues â€“ just as friends do. 








Mentoring Activities include but is not limited to the following:





*  Arts and crafts


*  Team Building


*  Goal setting


*  Conflict resolution


*  Motivation


*  Cultural diversity and sensitivity


*  Communication skills


*  Leadership development 


*  Self-esteem enhancement


*  Career exposure/awareness


*  College exposure/awareness


*  Community service


*  Social events or field trips








The youth we serve are some of the most disadvantaged in South Los Angeles.





â€¢	We are serving youth who are not attending school. 


â€¢	We are serving youth living below the federal poverty level. 


â€¢	We are serving youth whose parents are incarcerated.


â€¢	We are serving youth whose father and/or mother have abandon them.


â€¢	We are serving youth whose siblings have already joined gangs and/or have been in juvenile detention.

â€¢	We are serving youth who are being raised by grandparents.


â€¢	We are serving youth whose father and/or mother are using drugs.


â€¢	We are serving youth who are giving up on school and on life.





There is hope! Research shows that well-run mentoring programs are likely to be a powerful intervention for improving the well-being and academic and life skills of disadvantaged youth. It also states that youth in mentoring programs have higher levels of functioning including higher scholastic competence and grades, fewer days of class missed, lower levels of substance abuse, more positive peer and parent relationships, and less physical aggression.

3102022,2013022,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BigSunday.html,Engaging the Reluctant Volunteer, Social Connectedness,"<p>Actually, our title is a misnomer. We don't see people as volunteers. That suggests ""haves and havenots."" At Big Sunday, we think EVERYONE has some way they can help, and that the world is  full of ""haves and havemores."" That's why our target audience is... everyone. And they're not volunteers, they're participants. Helpers. From homeless people to CEOs, all treated and valued the same. Sometimes the line between who is giving or receiving help is blurred, and we think that's great. And our speciality, it seems, is the reluctant person  the one who thinks they don't have the time, or the talent, or the money, or perhaps even the inclination to help.</p>


<p>We do this by providing all kinds of ways to help. By making it as easy or difficult as someone wants. To make everything inclusive. To focus on what unites us, not what divides us. To bring people together. And to make it fun.</p>


<p>Thus, our idea is to create a clearinghouse of giving and helping.</p>


We are already on the road to doing that. Big Sunday sponsors and promotes all kinds of traditional volunteering experiences, from beach cleanups to feeding the hungry. We also offer many giving opportunities, whether it's school supplies in August, toys at Christmas or ongoing needs like food or clothing. Some people seek a onetime helping experience while others are looking for something longterm. While many people have skills to offer  be it plumbing, legal expertise, hairdressing or medicine  for many, their gift is their friendly demeanor, or ability to make anyone feel wanted and needed. As such, we host all kinds of community dinners, parties, fieldtrips and outings for people to get to meet and known one another. </p>


<p>We want to start by doing it right here in L.A.. And, while we like to think as big as anyone, and have benefitted firsthand from the power of social media, we treasure the interaction between people  something which hopefully be as cherished in 2050 as it is today  so we will at first focus on the greater L.A. area.</p>


<p>The truth is, people in L.A. are very engaged. For instance, during the 8 week period we are now in, here are just some of the events taking place in the area: the L.A. Marathon, The L.A. Times Book Fair, CivLAVia, Coachella, the Israel Festival, Earth Day, Fiesta Broadway, ShareFest, the Annual FoLAR River CleanUp, City Lights, and Big Sunday Weekend, plus all kinds of walks and runs and fairs and festivals for all kinds of good causes. Between the events listed above, more than 1,000,000 people will be engaged. That's a lot of people. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. For sure, anyone who has ever driven in L.A. has, at some point, been blocked by the masses of people enjoying one of these events. People want to be involved. They just need to know where they're wanted and needed. </p>


<p>What can get more problemmatic is when many worthy groups are vying for people, dollars, and attention.</p>


<p>We'd start by reaching out to the many nonprofit & service organizations, plus festivals and events in town and create a common calendar so that both the public and all agencies would know what the other is doing and thus maximizing everyone's effectiveness and output (while minimizing time wasted as different organizations work hard to do the same thing). We'd build a common website (with links to each group's individual website), as well an annual printed brochure (e.g., like that of the Hollywood Bowl, so that people could see all their options at once).</p>


<p>If a nonprofit needs something  be it new crayons for their students, new furniture for residents, warehouse space, a new executive director, or cash for any of the above, they can go to one site to see what it needed. Last year, Big Sunday started an initiative like this called theBIGlist. Since then we have made matches for everything from Subzero refrigerators to trees to a basset hound.</p>


<p>We'd continue & grow our Monthly on Melrose program of concerts, movie screeings, singalongs and parties, designed not just to help people, but to bring them together. These events usually include a meal, where people come knowing the mission is to not just join friends & family, but to mix it up  these events usually include not just regular volunteers, but invited guests such from group homes, shelters, or senior or vets' organizations.</p>


<p>We want to help get rid of the idea of ""the other."" If someone is an ""other"" it can create fear, anxiety, resentment, or misunderstanding. ""The other"" is often an idea. It's a person, or a type of person that we've heard about or read about, maybe even seen, but never looked in the eye and had a conversation. The ""other"" is often someone we thing we're working at crosspurposes with, but have never tried to, or had to, engage in something together  even if that something is as simple as counting cans in a food drive painting a classroom, enjoying a game of bingo, or sharing a laugh.</p>","We got Max Geller to volunteer. Max is a nice guy who never volunteers for anything. No reason why. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big Sunday hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00 a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)





Also: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a yearround community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civicminded kids; The End of the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.





We have won all kinds of awards, and been cited and recognized by all kinds of nice and impressive groups.





Truly, though, our most important achievement lies not in how much we've done, but the spirit in which we've done it. We are proud that we've brought many people to a new part of town, be it South Central or Beverly Hills, for the first time. We're proud of our ability to cross racial, religious, age, and socioeconomic lines to bring nice people together to enjoy one another in all kinds of ways.





","At Big Sunday our target audience is everyone. Kind of broad, we know. Then again, we already work with hundreds of partners all over Los Angeles  schools (all ages, public and private, religious and secular), faith groups, businesses, elected officials, neighborhood councils, civic groups, clubs, alumni groups, teams, nonprofits, and more. Big Sunday has no religious or political agenda and reaches out to and embraces the participation of all groups, provided it's done in a spirit of generosity, understanding, openmindedness and tolerance.





We've built and fostered strategic alliances of all sorts to reach out to engage people in many communities, from the mayor's office to the archdiocese to the Girl Scouts. We'll continue to do so.","Big Sunday already has a number of these programs going. This grant would allow us to not just expand those programs, but add new ones, too.





We would evaluate the project in numerous ways:





1) Recreating Big Sunday's Community Calendar to be a areawide listing of events. Success would be measured by: a) creation of online calendar, b) creation of printed calendar, c) creation of common website, d) how many events are listed e) if the listings increased attendance or success for the listee, f) amount of traffic, g) if this led to any kind of ongoing relationship between the helper and the nonprofit, h) becoming selfsustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising, i) whether it led to cooperation between nonprofit groups, j) if it becomes a model for other cities or regions





2) Counting all participants; indetifying repeat and 1sttime participants.





3) Identifying continued civic participation and interaction with people and/or organizations through a connection first made at a Big Sunday event.





4) theBIGlist  a) how many items are listed to be given away, b) how many matches are actually made, c) amount of traffic, d) becoming selfsustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising





5) theARTlist  a) how many events are listed , b) how listing affects attendance at events and, if applicable, sales, c) amount of traffic, d) growth, e) becoming selfsustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising





5) Monthly on Melrose  a) continued success of the program as measured against mission of each event, b) attendance, c) repeat attendance, d) if attendees develop an ongoing relationship with others they've meet, e) if attendees maintain a relationship with the nonprofit they've helped, f) testimonials of participants, g) growth of the initiative, either through increasing the scope or frequency of the project





6) Continued support and growth of existing programs such as The Big Sunday Holiday List (ways to help at the holidays); The End of the Month Club (our monthly food drive); Everyone Eats, Everyone Wins (community meals at ethnic restaurants throughout town); The Big Sunday Chill Out Express (a party bus that everyone is welcome on and the price of admission is something from the Big Sunday Wish List to help another nonprofit); See Your City Tours (field trips to all different parts of town, and including tours by foot, bike, boat, bus and on horseback)





7) Ability to introduce new initiatives, such asThe Big Sunday Emergency Fund (to meet emergency needs) and W.H.O. (Who Helps Out), an online biography of inspiring unsung people in the community.








","<p>Our project will benefit L.A. by making helping easy, accessible and inclusive. More than that, by bringing people of different worlds together in the name of helping, and focusing on what we have it common, it will be clear what we can accomplish when we work together. Finally, by working to make events impactful, rewarding and fun, we will help build a culture of helping and civic engagement.</p>


Along the way, we will fill food pantries, stock classrooms, tend gardens, fix buildings, raise money for worthy causes, and engage, empower, validate and bring together people of all ages, backgrounds and means throughout LA.</p>


<p>We are reluctant to give numbers because then the tail can start wagging the dog. Of course, we understand that goals are important: so we can promise to next year give away 20,000 books or 25,000 pounds of food or 5000 bags of clothing; provide 2500 Christmas toys, or raise thousands of dollars to send kids to camp, fight cancer, or respond to a natural disaster. Host a community dinner for 200 every month, create an annual art show and pet adoption and concert. Hold beautification days at 50 different schools. Make large scale capital improvements at shelters, afterschool facilities, or homes for vets or seniors. Engage 50,000 people a year. All are doable, and we've done them and more.</p>


<p>Here's the thing: Big Sunday is, perhaps, not the youngest or hippest organization out there. And, while we see how important it is to engage young people, we think people can still help after they're 34. Or 54. Or 94. Big Sunday is nothing if not inclusive, reaching out to and including people of all ages and backgrounds and at all socioeconomic levels, letting them know that they're wanted and needed, getting them involved, and bringing them together with other goodhearted people.</p>


<p>Full disclosure: We'd considered coming up with some very specific project for this proposal. But having been around for a number of years, we believe that there is no silver bullet. Change comes about through an ongoing, concerted effort. We are proud of the work we do and have done, and an opportunity like this would allow us to continue and expand it. When we started years ago, we said we wanted to be a group that brings people together to make the world a better place, not in response to a catastrophe, or because of a single compelling incident, but because it's the right thing to do. We like to think that we, through the ongoing generosity, goodwill, hard work, humor, dirty hands and big hearts of many, have accomplished that.</p>


<p>Then again, by creating an easily navigated system to both meet and fulfill needs, and by helping to bring together our terrific brethren in L.A.'s helping world, we can greatly expand this culture of caring, concern and compassion, and engage even more people in the process of making life better and easier for all Angelenos.</p>","There would be an actual space (picture, say, The Beverly Center) devoted to improving the world. It would include social service agencies; places for people of all ages, as well as groups to volunteer; a food pantry for those who need food and those who want to donate it; what is now Macy's would be a departmentstore sized highend thrift store of items of all kinds providing items for both those in need and those wanting a bargain, as well as revenue for a syndicate of nonprofits and jobs for those looking for work; nonprofit stores (such as the craft store at the Downtown Women's Center) and forprofit stores (such as Tom's) with a social action mission; restaurants like The Homeboy Cafe, where people who need a second chance to have a good job; the space now housing The Grand Lux would be set up like a German beer hall, with familystyle tables where locally grown and raised food would be served to people family style and where people could meet someone new; exhibit and performance spaces for nonprofits, schools and individuals to show their work; gathering spaces for people of all walks of life to congregate not just with their friends, but with different people of all ages and backgrounds for events like concerts or singalongs; a nokill rescue for stray animals; a rooftop sustainable vegetable garden; classrooms and a lecture hall; and a full programming schedule with ways for people to help, both onsite and throughout the city. This would not be a place for rich people to help poor people. It would be a destination spot, welcoming to all, where people could go knowing they would be able to do their part, large or small, to make the world a better place.





There would be smaller branches around town, so different neighborhoods could host events. Because people would now be so used to interacting, no one would have to be afraid of going to a new neighborhood. Instead, people could enjoy meeting new people; discovering a neighborhood's history; celebrate the talents of those in a new neighborhood; help maintain the neighborhood's community garden or park; provide company to the area's elderly or infirm.





Because people will have spent more time interacting, face to face, with people from worlds different than their own, there would be less fear or suspicion and more understanding. People would see firsthand the inequities that poor people face (lesser schools, fewer shopping options, dirtier streets) and be more inclined to do something about it. Because they'd have more interaction with the disenfranchised and lonely (seniors, the ailing, vets), more people would take the time to be sure that these people had more company, and more attention paid. Finally, people who have greater means, would have the opportunity to be seen not just as helpers or donors, but as people with their own hopes, fears and disappointments.





Success would be the elimination of the ""other."" It would not be us vs. them; Los Angeles would just be a city of ""us."""

To launch the project, bike counters with digital displays will be installed in high traffic locations in Los Angeles to improve awareness of the number of bicyclists using the streets and bike lanes. These digital counters have been installed with much success in cities like Seattle, Portland and in several European cities in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. They are highly visible beacons that have proven successful in broadcasting awareness to drivers, pedestrians and other bikers and help improve the visibility and safety of bicyclists on city streets.","We have been involved in a number of projects focusing on urban mobility and the interface with cities and the built environment. Marc Alt was founding Executive Director of the Green Parking Council, a nonprofit organization which is seeking to transform parking into a platform for innovation to support bike sharing, car sharing, electric car charging infrastructure, green building standards and reinventing parking as a force for good in cities. Marc has also worked with some of the leading companies in the automotive, architecture and engineering fields on urban mobility projects, including the launch of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.","We would like to partner with numerous bicycling advocacy groups working in L.A. on various aspects of bicycle transportation and urban planning, community advocacy, access and safety. We would also like to partner with L.A. City, L.A. County Department of Public Works, the L.A. County Bicycle Coalition, LADOT, CicLAvia and many of the other advocacy groups that are passionate about raising awareness about bicycling safety and improving access to safe biking on city and county streets.","Using measuring devices from companies such as Eco Counter, actual metrics of increases in numbers of bicyclists on city roads will be captured and reported. Baseline and target metrics will be established in partnership with the city and county's master plans for bicycling.",Increasing the visibility of bicyclists will improve the safety of biking in L.A. and will in turn lead to more people feeling comfortable choosing to commute via bicycle.,"By 2050, a large network of monitoring devices and sensors would be installed throughout the L.A. region, both stationary counting devices and mobile sensing devices via bikemounted sensors, mobile apps on cellphones and other open source counting, measuring and monitoring devices. This open data would be aggregated and made available to the public and to L.A. County to integrate into existing and future smart city traffic monitoring programs, allowing bicycle traffic to be included in city and countywide realtime traffic monitoring programs.





The biggest success indicator would be increase in public awareness of bike safety, a measurable reduction of bicycling accidents involving vehicles, improvements in human health and wellbeing due to increased outdoor activity, reduced vehicle miles, improved air quality and a sense of wellbeing and community that has been documented in cultures that use bicycles for commuting."
3102024,2013024,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/begreat.html,BE GREAT Mentoring Program , Education,"Mar Vista Gardens is the third largest public housing site in the city of Los Angeles and is located in the 5th most crimeridden neighborhood.  The average household income at Mar Vista Gardens is $1,713 per month, more than half of households live at poverty level, and 67% of adult residents do not have a high school diploma. Currently, 600 school age youth live in this community.





Our idea is to provide an afterschool mentoring program that ensures that all the children in the Mar Vista Gardens community have the opportunity to build successful and productive futures for themselves and their families. The BE GREAT: Graduate program is the Boys & Girls Clubâ€™s solution to the low educational attainment rates and cycle of poverty in lowincome communities like Mar Vista Gardens. BE GREAT is an evidencebased dropout intervention program that targets young people who are most vulnerable to dropping out of school. The program is based on the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Check & Connect model, which is one of 27 dropout intervention programs reviewed by the U.S. Department of Education thus far.  It is proven to have positive effects for keeping youth in school. 





The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens will implement the BE GREAT: Graduate model to support and encourage academic achievement for young residents, ages 6 to 18 years. The BE GREAT program has three components: 





1)	MentorYouth Relationships â€“ Club staff and community volunteers build longterm mentoring relationships with youth by creating an environment of trust and open communication. The goal is to instill in young people the belief that â€œthey can, they want to, and they belong.â€


2)	Intentional Tracking â€“ Club staff watch for warning signs of student withdrawal from school (i.e. attendance, behavior and course failure). As mentors, they work with program participants to develop timely intervention that focuses on reducing negative factors, increasing strengths, problem solving and persistence. 


3)	Enhanced ClubSchoolHome Partnership and Communication â€“ The Club and local schools work together to share information. The Club proactively reaches out to parents in order to engage them in their childrenâ€™s education.





Research conducted by Boys & Girls Clubs of America suggests that youth who attend program approximately once per week are more likely to demonstrate positive outcomes than those who attend less frequently. In order to ensure that our BE GREAT program is the most effective, we need to incorporate it into a comprehensive youth development program that provides a safe environment and fun, engaging activities. Support from the Goldhirsh Foundation and the LA2050 Challenge would allow us to create an interactive space where youth feel comfortable learning, playing, and building trusting relationships. Resources for an effective BE GREAT program include professional and committed youth development staff, a strong community volunteer program, academic enrichment activities in language arts and STEM subjects, and engaging space for learning, playing and socializing.





The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens is still in the process of building and creating the necessary resources to realize our goal of operating a successful BE GREAT: Graduate program. Since we opened on January 28, 2013, more than 250 of the 600 schoolage youth who live in the community have registered as Club members. Because membership is also open to youth from the surrounding neighborhood, we have the potential to serve hundreds more young people. The BE GREAT program would provide mentoring for all registered Club members, ensuring that they receive consistent support from caring and trusted adults. Moreover, it fulfills a critical need by addressing social and emotional problems that homework help and tutoring alone do not solve.","The Boys & Girls Club of Mar Vista Gardens has only just recently opened on January 28th.  To date, 264 young people from the housing community have registered as Club members (out of 600 school age residents). Other highlights from the past two months include the formation of our first sports league (Ultimate Lacrosse League), creation of a recycling program for the housing community operated by Club members, our first Family Night celebration in honor of our one month anniversary, a St. Patrickâ€™s Day party for teen members, and upcoming Easter Celebration for the entire community. Our Club members have started creating animated cartoons and recording music in our tech room. We are extremely proud of our teen members who have started tutoring our younger members. Two of our teens also had the opportunity to go to the Keystone Conference for their demonstrated leadership and community service.","Clare Foundation

â€¢	Frequency of attendance


â€¢	Percent of surveyed members that are performing at grade level (based on age)


â€¢	Highest level of schooling that members expect to complete


â€¢	Percent of surveyed members that expect to complete high school


â€¢	Percent of members that report an optimal Club Experience based on their relationship with a caring adult


â€¢	Extent to which members feel connected to school as demonstrated through grades, school attendance, and effort and interest in school work.





Each of these indicators was chosen for its usefulness to either demonstrate or predict a young personâ€™s achievement of one or more positive outcomes. The indicators are researchbased and ageappropriate. 





Data collection will be conducted through several mechanisms including member selfreporting, partnerships with local schools, and BGCAâ€™s National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI). The NYOI connects our Club member tracking database with the National Outcomes Database, which collects and analyzes member demographics such as attendance, program participation and community service hours. The majority of program indicators will be collected using the National Outcomes Survey, which asks ageappropriate questions about member behaviors and attitudes regarding the Club experience as well as academic achievement, good character and citizenship, and healthy lifestyles. Surveys are available in both English and Spanish.","The high school dropout rate in Los Angeles County is more than 20%. This rate is even higher for Hispanic and black students and students from lowincome households. The community at Mar Vista Gardens, which is 84% Hispanic and has 55% of households living at the federal poverty level, is highly representative of this achievement gap. Through this project, we would be able to establish the BE GREAT program at Mar Vista Gardens as a model for other lowincome and public housing communities. In fact, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plans to use our afterschool program, which is built around BE GREAT, as the model for youth programs at all of its housing sites. As a result, the program has the potential to impact nearly 7,000 young HACLA residents, and this number is continuing to grow as HACLA develops more lowincome housing sites.





Specifically, the BE GREAT model has proven to have the following results for youth participants who complete the program (based on data collected by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America over two years):


â€¢	54% maintained or improved their school attendance 


â€¢	77% showed a constant or improved grade in reading


â€¢	74% showed a constant or improved grade in math


â€¢	56% maintained or improved their behavior at school


â€¢	98% progressed to the next grade level on time





By implementing BE GREAT at Mar Vista Gardens, our ultimate goal is to break the cycle of poverty for families living in the community.  BE GREAT uses strengthbased strategies and problem solving techniques to help young people develop the academic, emotional and social skills necessary to succeed in school. Improved academic achievement will encourage students to stay in school and graduate on time, thus increasing opportunities for advancement through college and employment.","As an organization, we want to have more youth from across Los Angeles registered as Club members and greater participation from the community, especially family members and educators. A successful program will also mean greater retention of members during middle and high school, and a member graduation rate of 100%. The BE GREAT: Graduate program depends upon a high level of dedication and investment from community stakeholders, and it will help us forge more partnerships and strengthen existing ones. By 2050, we expect to see the BE GREAT mentoring program model at all Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles community sites, actively working to close the achievement gap among minority and lowincome students. We also hope that schools throughout the city will adopt a similar mentoring model for after school programming if they are not already partnered with a local Boys & Girls Club. We want to transform the way Los Angeles educates our young people by introducing a holistic mentoring approach that supports their social and emotional development in order to foster academic and future success."
3102025,2013025,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BGCVenice.html,Boys & Girls Club of Venice Learning Center Renovation, Education,"One of over 4,300 Boys & Girls Clubs, our collective mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. We accomplish our mission by providing a safe haven away from negative influences; an ongoing relationship with trained, caring adult role models; constructive, supervised programs that are sensitive to the needs of youth atrisk; guidance and encouragement in educational and career endeavors; positive programs that encourage strong values, selfesteem and a healthy lifestyle; a solid gang prevention and intervention initiative; a vision of life beyond adolescence; facilitation and reinforcement of a positive peer group environment; and family support. 





Our vision for the new Learning Center is to create a fun, stimulating environment, rich with technology, resources and opportunities that inspires learning.  The new Learning Center will enable us to increase capacity, improve and expand our programs and continue to provide youth with the resources they need to build a solid platform to reach their full potential. To meet these needs, we have developed a multiphased plan. The first three phases are renovating the following areas: main learning center, digital library/leadership room, and technology lab.





The plans for the renovation project include:





â€¢Creating a synergy of existing spaces that will enhance the learning experience and supports educational success;





â€¢Increase access to technology, resources, opportunities and educational support;





â€¢Provide highly flexible spaces to encourage the constantly changing learning environment;





â€¢Incorporate a sustainable design to support energyefficiency. 





As incredible as our facility is, our Learning Center is overutilized and we have not fully accommodated for growth. We feel this inadequacy in every aspect of our core programs. Renovation and expansion of the Clubâ€™s Learning Center will enable the following:





â€¢A â€œlearning centerâ€ where tutors and volunteers from the community can be matched to youth in need of additional educational help. Our members need a quiet place to do their homework afterschool and there are few â€œquiet areasâ€ where students can concentrate on schoolwork. Individual study carrels will allow privacy and study tables can be rearranged to accommodate groups. 





â€¢Locker storage space: Currently there are no lockers storing personal items. On any given day, one can walk into the Learning Center and find walls lined with backpacks, books, and coats of dozens of youth that have no space to store these items.





â€¢A computer lab where youth could become more familiar with emerging technologies. Currently, 70% of our members are without computer and internet access at home and without home access students struggle to complete their homework causing them to fall further behind. The expansion of a computer lab would take the first step in addressing this need.





â€¢A meeting room where club members could meet with staff and adult mentors to discuss school performance. The Clubâ€™s group character and leadership groups would use the room for their meetings and to assist in planning community service activities. 





â€¢Kindle books have now overtaken paperback books and the trend towards digital books is one that cannot be ignored and we are committed to maintain relevance in an everchanging digital environment. Yearround reading programs and family literacy programs will be hosted in our new digital library.","The Boys & Girls Club of Venice was established in 1968 as a VISTA project on Venice Beach.  The Club then operated for many years from a converted duplex home on Lincoln Boulevard, which was finally condemned after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In 2000, after a successful capital campaign, the Club celebrated the grand opening of its new 30,000 sq.ft. facility at 2232 Lincoln Boulevard. The new Club features a basketball court and gymnasium, stage area, kitchen, teen/career center and store, counseling department, community room, music room, wellness center, art studio, activity center, computerized learning center, library, and administrative offices. 





The past year has been an amazing culmination of opportunity meeting execution. Through the generosity of our donors and volunteers and with the care and commitment of our staff, we have created an environment where reaching new heights is the norm, and excellence prevails in many areas of the Club.


 


Since 2006, we have increased the number of college scholarships distributed annually from one to eight with the total amount annually distributed increasing from $1,000 to over $60,000.


 


In the fall of 2010, the Club completed its fourth major renovation project in the last five years when it opened its doors to the newly renovated teen lounge. The renovation of the teen lounge comes after major renovations of the art center, technology center, and gymnasium.


 


In 2011, the Club chartered its fifth afterschool site at Mark Twain Middle School, where we will service middle school students through our Tomorrowâ€™s Leaders, PowerHour homework help, the arts, sports, fitness, and recreation programs.


 


These services are critical and are coming at a time, when children and families need the support of the community to navigate the challenging waters of unemployment, decreased government spending, and unforgiving streets.


 


In our Club as a whole, over threequarters of our members are Latino/a, or African American. Our Club children are challenged every day by the breakdown of traditional family structures:


 


48% of Club members are from single parent households 59% qualify for free or reducedprice lunches at school Several LAPD Gang Injunctions reflect gang territories; our youth walk through them on the way to school.





In spite of these challenges, we continue to achieve miracles, and enhance our core services. Without the support of individuals like you who breathe life into our youth development organization, our mission and work would be filled with empty dreams and missed opportunities to make a difference in the life of a child.


","Our key project volunteers include Dina Morgan, Chair of FIDMâ€™s Interior Design Department, and Thomas Carson, AIA and founder of Carson Architects. 





The project will begin when we have secured 85% of the costs. We have already received one grant for this project and also have requests currently under consideration by past supporters of the Club.


","The construction of the renovation project will be evaluated at three different phases as follows:





â€¢Phase1: The expected results of the design report shall include the conceptual design, drawing list, specification list, architectural rendering, conceptual floor plan, detailed project description, and cost estimates developed by architectural consultant(s) and by FIDM students. Phase 1 will be completed by June 1, 2013.





â€¢Phase 2: Prepare bidding documents, solicit and evaluate bids, and select contractors by August 1, 2013.





â€¢Phase 3: Monitor workin progress, ensure compliance with organizational needs, project program and design standards, contract specifications, and applicable building codes. Construction will begin August 31, 2013 with an estimated completion of December 1, 2013.","According to UCLA Institute for Democracy, Education and Access, at Venice High for every 100 students in the class of 2008 who started 9th grade, only 39 graduated, and only 20 of those took the â€œAGâ€ courses needed for entrance to Californiaâ€™s colleges and universities. Among African American and Latino students there the numbers are even more dismal: only 31 graduated and only 12 finished AG. Of our Club members at Venice High, 58% are Latino and 17% are African American, so most of our members are considered unlikely to graduate high school, much less go on to higher education. 





Our newly renovated Learning Center will provide youth with the support and skills needed to succeed in school, work, and life in the 21st century by increasing access to computer technology, offering casemanaged academic assistance, informing and encouraging youth and their families to make an educational plan, and matching each youth with an adult mentor. 





The outcome we expect from enhancing our Learning Center will be:





â€¢75% of participants will move up at least one letter grade in math and english/reading. 





â€¢60% of participants will move up at least one level on the California Standards Test scores in English/reading and math.





Our evaluation consists of several strategies: 





â€¢Mentoring  We provide an adult mentor for every participant. Our Club already has over forty adult mentors working with our youth. In addition to Club staff, our group of mentors includes AP students from Venice High, college students, and adult community volunteers. We are always looking for more adult mentors. 





â€¢Goals for Graduation â€“ Monthly presentations will be held for all program participants introducing academic goal setting. Through incremental goalsetting, members create an action plan with daily and weekly goals leading to both short and longterm gains. Included in the approach is a comprehensive guidance strategy that helps members connect their smallest results to their highest dreams. 





â€¢Case Management will be used with all participants. Club staff will share information informally about individuals needing extra help on a weekly basis. They will also meet and discuss the progress and problems of all program participants formally on a monthly basis. When reports from volunteer mentors, teachers or administrators show a youth having poor scores or frequent absences, we can intervene immediately, before waiting for the next report card grading period.","In 2012, we made great strides in several key areas to support our critical mission.  Our progress is encouraging, but our work is far from over. We must reach more kids. Many more young people are waiting to be introduced to the Boys & Girls Club of Venice and


start their great future. With support from the Goldhirsh Foundation, LA2050, and the Los Angeles community, we can continue to ensure that every child who enters the doors of our Club graduates


from high school on time, with a solid plan for the future.





Our goal for 2050 is to serve more kids more frequently.  We know from research that youth who attend the club more often and over a longer period of time are mroe likely to succeed in school, give back to their communities and choose healthier lifestyles.  That's why we must engage more kids and teens in the total Club experience."
3102026,2013026,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BRAINCANCERLA.html,Development of a Multidisciplinary Los Angeles CountyBased Brain Cancer Program , Health,"     Being diagnosed with a brain tumor is a lifechanging and potentially harrowing experience that greatly affects patients and families alike.  The treatment of brain tumors is inherently complex, and requires streamlined management by a variety of healthcare practitioners (physicians, nurses, rehabilitation specialists, social workers, hospice workers, etc.)  Patients diagnosed with brain tumors are often young and otherwise healthy and productive members of society that may suddenly transition to requiring frequent and chronic care, resulting in reduced workforce participation and mandating a variety of additional support services.  The physical, financial, and emotional burdens on patients diagnosed with brain cancer, as well as their families, are further exacerbated when they are constrained by complex socioeconomic factors. 


	Numerous studies have identified significant healthcare disparities with regard to access to care and treatment outcomes in brain tumor patients with lower socioeconomic or minority status, less education, and no insurance (Curry WT, Neurosurgery, 2010 and Mukherjee D, J Clin Neurosci, 2013).  For brain tumor patients with such disadvantages, following complex treatment regimens (such as chemotherapy, daily radiation therapy, or clinical trials) and navigating a complex healthcare system composed of fragmented clinics and/or hospitals or nonnative languages can be especially disheartening.  These factors, coupled with the neurological deficits often caused by these tumors (such as paralysis or language/memory deficits) makes adherence to complex medical regimens even more of a struggle.  It is therefore no surprise that many patients with socioeconomic disadvantages receiving brain tumor care have a difficult time making all their appointments (often several per week), or adhering to physician recommendations, sometimes resulting in delays in timesensitive care.  


	The LA County+USC Medical Center is the largest public hospital in Southern California, serving as a safety net institution and providing quality healthcare to millions of underserved and indigent Angelenos and other U.S. and world citizens.  In January 2013, a group of Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Keck School of Medicine of USC physicians decided to form a multidisciplinary Brain Tumor/ NeuroOncology Clinic at LAC+USC in an attempt to streamline care for patients with complex primary brain tumors being treated at all LA County facilities.  The weekly LAC+USC Brain Tumor Clinic staffed by these physicians receives patient referrals from any LA CountyDHS sites AND OTHER LA HOSPITALS, thus serving as the ONLY centralized multidisciplinary NeuroOncology clinic for LA county residents.  Patients have access to neurologists, neurooncologists, neurosurgeons, and radiationoncologists during the SAME clinic visit, allowing the panel of physicians to discuss bestpractice treatment options as a team, rather than fragmenting this care over several visits and potentially weeks or months.  Furthermore, the clinic allows ALL patients to access the same therapeutic clinical trials as firstrate private academic institutions and cancer centers, which is a factor that has independently been associated with prolonged survival in patients with brain cancer (Shahar T, J Clin Neurosci, 2012).  Although the Brain Tumor Clinic at LAC+USC was designed to accommodate a maximum of 12 patients per day, it is already overbooked to 1518 patients per clinic for the next 3 months, demonstrating the dire need for this integral service in LA County.  	


	Our primary aim is to develop a worldclass multidisciplinary Brain Tumor/NeuroOncology Center of Excellence that will provide all LA County patients, regardless of insurance status, race, or education level with the same access to quality care for years to come.  The development of a formal program at LAC+USC will ensure that this service is centralized at the Countyâ€™s primary safetynet institution for decades.  Support from the LA2050 grant will be used to develop a LA County NeuroOncology Center of Excellence, support a clinical nursing navigator/coordinator, manage a prospective patient database, create a program website and referral system, and provide seed money for researching brain tumor genomics and healthcare disparities in patients with brain tumors.  


     By 2050, the potential for healthcare delivery in complex medical problems such as brain tumors to become even more disparate is a sad but sobering reality.  Most indigent LA County patients with brain tumors do not have the luxury of visiting several practitioners or â€œshopping aroundâ€ for their care.  The potential to establish a Brain Tumor Center of Excellence embedded in our Countyâ€™s largest public medical center is likely to at least partially offset this disparity, and help ensure that all patients with brain tumors in LA have access to the same basic care, clinical trials, and rapidlyevolving therapies.","The multidisciplinary NeuroOncology program at LAC+USC is one of the few in all of Southern California to provide multidisciplinary care to complex brain tumor patients, and the only designated Los Angeles County facility to do the same.  The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to the population of LA County as a whole.  Over the past decade, we have treated thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institutedesignated Cancer Centers in Southern California).  Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained an open door policy in treating allcomer patients with brain cancer referred from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or socioeconomic status.  We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately 30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now the largest contributing registry to the NCIfunded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.  Many of our Brain Tumor Center physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient care and clinicaltranslational research, and have won numerous awards in recognition of their research contributions.  Finally, clinicianscientists in our group have published numerous peerreviewed research articles pertaining to novel treatments for brain tumors (such as inhaled therapies and vaccine trials), healthcare disparities and trends relating to brain tumors, and brain tumor genomics studies.","Gabriel Zada, MD (Neurosurgery)

Other memebrs of LAC+USC and the USC Norris Cancer Center Brain Tumor Center","The specific aims of the project are to: 1) Develop a centralized, multidisciplinary center of excellence for brain tumor patients throughout Southern California at LAC+USC Medical Center, 2) Accommodate the increasing number of patient referrals to this program, 3) Increase clinical trial enrollment for patients with brain tumors, 4) Increase research output from this program.





Success in these terms will be measured using very specific benchmarks according to each of these aims:


1)	Within 1 year of funding, we aim to have an organized program consisting of a clinical program director, website with referral information and clinical trial information, and clinical outcomes database for prospective patient data entry.


2)	During the first year following funding, we will monitor and compare specific clinical outcomes in patients before and after implementation of the clinical program. These will include: Time from diagnosis to initiation of treatment, time to completion of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, progressionfree survival, and overall survival.  In addition, the referral volume and overall clinical volume will be monitored.


3)	Patient Satisfaction: We will provide questionnaires to patients and allow them to rate their experience with the new multidisciplinary program as compared to prior to initiation of the program.


4)	During the first 2 years following funding, we will monitor the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials, as well as the number of newly established clinical trials based out of this program.


5)	During the first 2 years following funding, we will monitor the number of research papers published and new grants obtained from LA2050 seed funds.


","This project will benefit Los Angeles in several ways.  First and foremost, it will improve direct care to the thousands of Angelenos who already have existing benign and malignant brain tumors by developing the multidisciplinary NeuroOncology program at LAC+USC.  LAC+USC Medical Center is one of the busiest public hospitals in the western United States and the largest single provider of health care in Los Angeles County.  LAC+USC records nearly 39,000 inpatient discharges, 150,000 emergency department visits, and 1 million ambulatory care visits each year.  Secondly, it will help ensure that all residents of LA County have future access to a specialized NeuroOncology care, physicians, clinical trials, and emerging therapies for years to come, so that care provided to LAC+USC patients is on par with any National Cancer Center.  When new therapies for brain cancer do emerge, having the infrastructure in place to efficiently deliver care to patients with brain cancer will be critical; The proposed clinic will help with streamlined care delivery.  Thirdly, it will help develop a Center of Excellence in LA County for many years to come, serving as a structural model and network for additional specialty centers to develop.  Finally, research that emerges from this program may have indirect benefits for LA residents with brain tumors for years to come.  Although complete elimination of healthcare disparities in Los Angeles by 2050 is a daunting task, we aim to serve as a model program for how a group of practitioners/providers with converging goals for patients can be a Center of Excellence despite limited resources, and reduce healthcare disparities within our treatment focus area.  ","True success regarding health in malignant brain tumors will mean finding a CURE for this disease by 2050.  This can only be achieved through highquality RESEARCH AND CLINICAL STUDIES.  In addition, finding risk factors for brain tumors (such as genes, environmental factors, social factors, etc.) may help in preventing brain cancer or identifying individuals who are at particular risk for developing these tumors, and thereby increasing surveillance and providing earlier treatment.  


Realistically, however, if a promising clinical trial, emerging therapy, or even cure was to be developed for malignant brain tumors today, the time to dissemination into public countybased hospitals may lag behind some private institutions.  Development of a NeuroOncology Center of Excellence in the LA County system would provide an INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DELIVERING EQUAL ACCESS TO THE LATEST THERAPIES, cure or not, within the LA County referral network. Based on national healthcare trends and prior research studies, it has been shown that centralized/specialized care sites for complex diseases such as brain tumors provide the best outcomes for patients possible.  By 2050, prespecified Centers of Excellence may very well be the referral sites for a majority of patients with newly diagnosed conditions.  As such, a major parameter of success over the next several decades would be to become such a Center of Excellence and to minimize or eliminate healthcare disparity as it relates to availability of brain cancer treatment in LA.  By 2050, we aim to be a firstrate national and international Center of Excellence in NeuroOncology housed within a public county institution, ensuring that the latest therapies, such as vaccines, stem cell treatments, and drugs are delivered in a timely fashion to patients without regard to socioeconomic status, race, or neighborhood.

3102027,2013027,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/connections.html,The Connections Program, Education,"Bright Star Schools (BSS), a charter management organization operating three charter schools in the MidCity communities of Los Angeles and in the heart of Koreatown, has designed and introduced the Connections Program, an innovative and inclusive guidance program aimed at preparing our students for high school graduation and college success. Bright Star Schoolsâ€™ primary goal is to have all of our students collegeready by high school graduation, with several opportunities for university and college attendance available to them.  We currently serve 1,111 512th grade students between three school sites and will grow our network to include a fourth school in the 20132014 school year. 





The ethnic mix of our student body is 81% Latino and 11% AfricanAmerican and 5% KoreanAmerican.  Less than 15% of our students have parents who went to college and less than 24% have parents who speak English as a first language.  87% of our students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. Most students arrive at Bright Star Schools more than two years behind academically. Two years ago, based solely on academic performance, nearly 50% of our students were not ready to be promoted to the next grade. Faced with this alarming statistic, we designed the Connections Program to provide a comprehensive and individualized approach to our studentsâ€™ education to ensure that they graduated high school ontime with a clear postsecondary plan. 





The Connections Program is an original approach to serving atrisk youth by providing personalized wraparound supports and resources for every student and their family. Our students face many unique challenges â€“ neighborhood violence, poverty, learning disabilities, immigration issues, etc. â€“ which, unresolved, can make the difference between dropping out of school and becoming a collegebound graduate. To address these challenges, each student is assigned a â€œConnectorâ€, a staff person who is available at all times to listen, set academic and personal goals, give advice, and identify community resources that will ensure that their students are passing their classes, feeling safe and secure at home, and preparing for their future beyond high school. 





The Connections Program meets the academic, social and emotional needs of our lowincome and minority student body by providing comprehensive supports and resources reaching all facets of a studentâ€™s life. Connectors meet with their studentâ€™s teachers, counselors, service providers and family members to coordinate efforts, keep lines of communication open, and provide insight and support when needed. In this way, every student has an ally on staff whose sole purpose is to help them graduate from high school prepared to enter and succeed in a fouryear college or university.





The Connections Program takes the concept of traditional guidance counselor several steps beyond what would be seen in a classic public school. In a typical middle or high school, there is normally one guidance counselor for hundreds of students. Most students never meet their schoolâ€™s guidance counselor, or only meet the counselor if they are referred for some wrongdoing.  Our Connectors are guidance counselors in the truest sense of the word â€“ they provide personalized and aroundtheclock support to help students become successful high school graduates prepared for college and career. What makes the Connections Program so innovative and unique is the time our staff devotes to each student and the comprehensive support each Connector provides to our students and their families to ensure that there are no roadblocks in their path toward high school and college graduation.





Jaylan Alexander plans to be the first person in his family to attend college. Although highly motivated, he comes from a poverty stricken family and had no resources to help get him through high school, let alone navigate the high costs of applying and attending college. Through the Connections Program, Bright Star provided Jaylan with school uniforms, bus passes, and school supplies. His Connector made sure that the school covered the cost of his college applications and his Connector provided him with ongoing academic guidance and emotional and social support.  Jaylanâ€™s hard work and commitment to his education, coupled with the financial, academic and emotional support he received through the Connections Program, has put him on the path to college success. 





There are many others like Jaylan who have been able to succeed because of their involvement in the Connections Program. We have seen the Connections Program have a significant impact on the academic and social success of our students, enabling them to graduate high school prepared for the rigor and social challenges of college life. As Bright Star Schools grows, we will increase our impact on the students in Los Angeles that need us most.


","Since opening, Bright Star's schools have earned some of the highest API scores in Los Angeles, making our organization one of the preeminent schools for any child in Los Angeles.  It is the daily attention to our core values that has helped Bright Star Schools gain remarkable distinction as an academic leader among Los Angeles schools. California gives each public school a score on an Academic Performance Index (API); 800 being the state proficiency goal on a scale of 1000. Our continuing success is illustrated by our 201112 API scores: 





â€¢	Stella Middle Charter Academy (5th and 6th grades) earned an API score of 802. 


â€¢	Bright Star Secondary Charter Academy (7th 12th grades) earned an API score of 812. 





Distinctions: Stella Middle Charter Academy 


â€¢	Title I Achieving School (California Department of Education, 2011) 


â€¢	EPIC Award for Stella Middle Charter Academy Faculty (New Leaders for New Schools, Spring 2008) 





Distinctions: Bright Star Secondary Charter Academy 


â€¢	CA Distinguished School Award (California Department of Education, 2011) 


â€¢	WASC Accreditation (Western Association of Schools and Colleges, 2010) 





Bright Star Schools was recently awarded a $1 million grant from the Broad Foundation to fuel our growth. In March 2013, we were awarded our fourth charter from LAUSD for our new high school in the San Fernando Valley which will open in 20132014. We have also received generous startup funding from the Annenberg Foundation and the Kaplan Family Foundation for our Connections Program.





Since its inception, the Connections Program has had 100% participation. The Connections Program is currently serving 747 students in grades 712. During the 20112012 school year:


â€¢	Connectors helped 18 seniors prepare 262 applications to 63 colleges.


â€¢	100% of 2012 seniors graduated from high school 


â€¢	All high school graduates were collegebound


â€¢	Connectors increased communication between home and school (by meeting with family members and providing social service referrals)





Connectors have made great strides creating a collegegoing culture on our middle and high school campus. This year, Connectors established â€œCollege Clubsâ€ for middle school students and our juniors and seniors to encourage college and career exploration. These afterschool clubs provide fundamental information on the college admissions process and help students explore their career interests. Students learn how to research colleges online, navigate the admissions process, and receive the information and guidance when applying to colleges and universities. 





Connectors also built a â€œCollege Centerâ€ on the high school campus where students and families can access college resources such as financial aid and scholarship information and applications, admissions exams and study guides, and participate in collegebound workshops led by Connectors.


","Bright Star Schools cannot hope to make a sustainable impact on Los Angeles students without the ongoing support of our cityâ€™s businesses and social service providers. For example, DirectTV provides students with mentors through their employee volunteering program and collaborates with staff to lead vocational training to our high school students. 





Didi Hirsch is a community mental health center that provides therapeutic services to students and families for issues of grieving and loss, substance abuse, domestic abuse, anger management, and more. Didi Hirsch also leads parenting workshops on our 712 grade campus. The West Los Angeles Family Source Center provides our school community with financial consulting, tutoring and counseling.


","In their initial meeting, Connectors and their students fill out intake forms to gather information on the studentâ€™s school and home life, interests, and goals and aspirations. Connectors identify gaps where additional supports are needed (tutoring, enrichment classes, social services referrals, etc.) and with their student, set short and long term goals that they revisit and revise on a regular basis.  





Connectors communicate with their studentâ€™s teachers and support staff to ensure that their student is on target with their grades and graduation requirements. Connectors use a variety of sources to monitor studentsâ€™ progress toward their goal of high school graduation and college preparedness: attendance, homework completion, grades, exam results, and number of college applications completed. Connectors meet weekly as a team to discuss their students, share resources, and make program improvements, as needed.





Success is measured on several fronts: (1) The number of students successfully advancing to the next grade by the end of the school year; (2) the number of high school seniors graduating with a viable postsecondary plan; (3) the number of high school seniors enrolled in a 4year college or university; and (4) the number of Bright Star alumni who graduate college in 4 years or less. 





Malay Toston is a current 9th grade student at Bright Star Secondary Academy who has benefited tremendously from the Connections Program. When Malay joined Bright Star Schools, she was experiencing a lot of loss in her life. Her mother passed away the previous year, and due to her poor academic performance, Malay had been held back in school. She was functioning three grades below her grade level. She was dealing with the loss of her mother and the social and emotional isolation and shame of not continuing on with her peers. She felt alone and incapable of achieving academic success. 





Malay and her Connector met weekly after the death of her mother. Malay's Connector provided her with a journal to capture her feelings. Malay would submit her journal to her Connector, and her Connector would respond with inspirational feedback. They would then meet and discuss her thoughts and emotions. In addition, Malayâ€™s Connector sent her to selfesteem workshops and academic courses offered in the community to help boost her confidence. 





Soon, Malay's attitude towards school began to change. She maintained a 3.0 grade point average, and was promoted to the 9th grade at the end of the school year. She is excited to be a freshman in high school, and is a positive leader at school. She encourages students to do their best, and uses her story as a motivation to others. She was selected as Student of the Month during the month of September, and was elated to have her school celebrating her success. This year she was invited to participate in the annual College Experience Lesson trip, which selects highachieving students to tour east coast colleges. 


","Studies show that students tend to drop out of college because their expectationsâ€”academic, social, or bothâ€”donâ€™t match up with the reality of college life. Illprepared students also suffer from lack of motivation, inadequate preparation, and poor study skills. The National Center for Education Statistics indicates that dropout rates are particularly high for African American and Hispanic students. Other student populations at greater risk of dropping out include those who are the first in their family to attend college, and those who have limited English proficiency. The Connections Program aims to reverse this trend among those atrisk students in our city, and remove any potential barriers they may face as they prepare themselves  academically, financially, and emotionally â€“ for college life. 





Students in Los Angeles could benefit greatly from the Connections Program. Although the high school dropout rate for LA Unified improved slightly last year, the graduation rate dipped. According to the California Department of Education, 61.6% of LAUSD's Class of 2011 received their diplomas, compared with 62.4% who graduated in 2010. 


 â€œâ€¦At the rate California is going, it will take us 13 years to close the graduation gap between Latino and African American students and their white peers,â€ said Arun Ramanathan, executive director of Oaklandbased Education TrustWest. ""Itâ€™s time we stopped talking about this problem and invested in the strategies that top districts and schools are using to fix it.â€ 





The Connections Program aims to fix the graduation gap between lowincome and minority students and their more affluent peers by offering comprehensive support services to our students during their time at Bright Star Schools. Most Bright Star students enter our schools lagging behind their more affluent and white peers. Connectors meet with the same students for up to six years to provide consistent support and guidance, build trust and familiarity with their families, and work with those adults in their studentâ€™s life (teachers, counselors, parents, coaches, etc.) to coordinate services. Students establish strong bonds with their Connectors that help develop confidence and give them the encouragement needed to achieve their goals. Through this program, we are preventing any student from falling through the cracks of the educational system and ensuring that they fully prepared  academically, emotionally, and financially â€“ to attend a fouryear university and enter the 21st Century workplace. 





Since its inception, the Connections Program has proven to be an effective strategy that increases academic success among students of color and removes those obstacles that prevent college enrollment and graduation.


","Studies have shown that students who are well prepared for college coursework are more likely to stay in school and earn their degree. Through the Connections Program, Bright Star Schools provides our students with individualized support and guidance in the form of a Connector and schoolwide services such as the College Center and College Clubs that are aimed at preparing all students for high school graduation, a successful college experience and a fulfilling career. We see the Connections Program making an enormous impact on the atrisk youth of Los Angeles by leveling the playing field for those students traditionally prone to dropping out of high school and underrepresented in colleges and universities. The Connections Program guarantees that every student receives exposure to collegebound services and opportunities tailored to meet their specific needs. Students are paired with an advocate who supports them throughout their middle and high school career â€“ this continuity is critical for students who may experience upheaval in their lives that can disrupt their education. 





All students, regardless of income or skin color, are born equally able to learn. The only difference is that an affluent student's road to college is smoothly paved while the poor/minority/ immigrant studentâ€™s road to college is usually marked with potholes, bumps, and sharp turns. The job of our Connectors is to smooth out that road and fill in the potholes so that our students can reach their potential. There is no other public school we know of taking this kind of integrated, comprehensive approach to counseling. A Los Angeles that supports the Connections Program is a city that believes in creative, progressive and effective solutions to our cityâ€™s drop out problem. A Los Angeles that supports the Connections Program is a city that will see its high school graduation rate increase dramatically among minority and lowincome populations while experiencing record numbers of college enrollment among these underrepresented populations. Ultimately, the Connections Program will build a strong collegegoing culture among our school communities, making college the expectation not the exception among LAâ€™s most atrisk youth."
3102028,2013028,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/f2futurefest.html,f2 FutureFest LA,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"The f2: FutureFest LA 





The c3: Center for Conscious Creativity www.consciouscreativity.org proposes producing the launch of an annual ""worlds fair"" type LA cultural event featuring emerging entertainment technologies and the latest creations in the arts, entertainment and media industries with emphasis on how the arts, entertainment and creativity can create a better world. 





Initially, the f2 will take place downtown LA at LA Center Studios www.lacenterstudios.com and will feature a futures film festival, an arts and emerging technologies showcase and a music concert for a challenge/cause.  The buildings at the LA Center Studios will become canvases for unique digital projection mapping creations and the Vortex Dome www.vorteximmersion.com located at the studio will house a fulldome festival showcase as well.  The first of its kind in Los Angeles.  





The festival will also include the STATE OF THE ARTS symposium featuring thought leaders and experts addressing the latest trends in the arts and entertainment industries and will provide ideas and case studies around how the arts, creativity, entertainment and storytelling can be used to create a better world/future.  





The c3 has presented the STATE OF THE ARTS since 2010 when it first launched as a collaborative partner with the LA Opera's RING FEST LA www.c3so.com and www.c3visionlab.org and would now propose adding the f2 to its offerings in honor of the City of LA.  





The f2 will serve as an annual magnet attracting the world's greatest artists and creators and technology innovators to participate along the city's own talent pool.   It will be modeled after the tremendously successful Venice Biennale, SXSW in Austin, Texas, and the Fringe Festival in Endinburgh, Scotland (Statistics for 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe concluded that it was the largest on record: there were over 40,000 performances of over 2,500 different shows in 258 venues.  Ticket sales amounted to around 1.8 million.  There are now 12 fulltime members of staff.  For more details visit:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe).  





The f2 has the potential to become a global event that could rival the Edinburgh Fringe Festival potentially attracting millions of visitors to the city for this annual event as it seeds in the Fall of 2013 and then gradually involves the entire City of Greater Los Angeles, the Creative Capital of the World, to participate.  





The arts and creativity of children and students will also be included and arts and media colleges will also participate by encouraging their students to participate in the annual event.  





  ","In 2009 the c3 created a partnership with The Millennium Project www.millenniumproject.org, a global futurists think tank, and the founder of c3 serves as the Chair of their Global Arts and Media Node.  Together with the Millennium Project, we have present an annual STATE OF THE ARTS event since 2010.  In 2011 we copresented the STATE OF THE ARTS with the PGA:  Producers Guild of America and also hosted a think tank to address how arts and media professionals could help to address 15 global challenges through their work.  The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and was streamed globally.  During the think tank several ideas were generated including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15 Global Challenges and create films about their stories.  In 2012 the first class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the internet to create Mythic Challenges projects.  Fantastic!  Seven films were created by these students.  To view these films visit the c3 site page and scroll down to the bottom of the page:  http://consciouscreativity.com/millenniumproject/mythicchallenges  Not only did the students learn about mythic challenges storytelling and filmmaking they also learned about what a professional futurist is and does.  In 2012 we were also awarded a $50,000 grant to produce an immersive ballet in the dome with a renowned 83 year old ballet dancer/choreographer.  The piece, BLUE APPLE, was successfully premiered in September 2012 in the Vortex Dome to a very appreciative audience.  ","The Millennium Project www.millenniumproject.org will copresent with the c3 as they have since 2010.  Futurists and PhDs David Wright and Jose Ramos, amongst other futurists, will participate in presenting the f3 futures film festival portion of the f2 and we will invite other relevant non profit organizations to team up with us who specialize in arts and creativity education and projects for children and youth so as to involve them in the festival as well.  Cal Arts. Otis, USC, UCLA, Art Center, Chapman College will be invited to have their students participate.   ",The f2 will be deemed a success by evaluating the number of artists and attendees who participate in the festival and the symposium who have a positive experience.  Optimal financial success will be measured by the total income and profit made from the event so that the f2 can continue to be produced and evolve into the future.  ,"Los Angeles would benefit by hosting a unique annual world famous arts and entertainment event much like SXSW has done for Austin, Texas, the Venice Biennale has done for Venice, Italy and the Fringe Fest has done for Edinburgh, Scotland (which touts itself as the largest arts festival in the world).    It would bring together the worlds of technology, entertainment and the arts and engage citizens of all ages to participate from across the city and globally.  The artist and creative professionals will benefit by the publicity they will gain from participating in the f2, the  tourism industry in LA will benefit and LA will stay at the cutting edge of creativity and technology due to being inspired to showcase this event each year.  ","Much like the World's Fair and the Venice Biennale, the f2: FutureFest LA will have grown to become a prestigious citywide global festival that persons of all ages participate in.  It will inspire year round innovative project creation and engage students and youth to learn new creative skill sets like filmmaking, dance, music  from classical to new music, art, fashion, design, architecture, photography and art forms we've yet to invent.  The world will admire LA for continuing to serve as the Creative Capitol of the world and countries will send their artists to the f2 to represent and present the greatest innovative art from their country.  Inherent in the mission of the f2 will be the spirit and goal of art and entertainment and culture to uplift and transform humanity  to create a better and more evolved future.  LA will have benefitted by being host to this remarkable festival showcasing the great genius of humankind.       "
3102029,2013029,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/GrassGreener.html,Why is the grass always greener over the leach fields?, Environmental Quality,"Wildwood Mobile Home Country Club is a mobile home park with an old fairway/golf course connected to it.  The fairway has been used as a leach field for the storm water runoff by the neighboring landfill for the last 56 years (unbeknownst to most Wildwood residents).  However, it is also a recreation area for the parkâ€™s hundreds of residents.  On an already contaminated site (an identified EPA superfund site), my idea is to create a built freshwater marsh, bioswales and walking paths for the residents and wildlife in the area; to transform a 15 acre lawnmonoculture field into a diverse ecology that benefits multiple users and remediates water.  This is a multistep project that will likely require millions of dollars and community input and development.  The $100,000 would be used to build an initial bioswale and develop a plan for the full marsh, with the objective of gathering support and finding additional funding.  The Community Development Commission of LA (CDC) and County Supervisor Knabe are currently funding a new $4 million Orange Grove Park (5.5 acres) a mile and a half away from Wildwood (Knabeâ€™s website 2013).  Considering the environmental negligence towards this site, I seek to bring attention to Wildwood because it is also my home.


Wildwood Mobile Home Park has over 360 mobile homes.  Squeezed by a railroad and the San Jose Creek to the North and the 60 freeway and La Puente Landfill to the South, the thin site stretches a mile long and shares its slim width with a mostly turf fairway (what used to be a 9 hole golf course).  With each mobile home setup on 1/16th an acre, the fairway serves as the parkâ€™s primary green space.  Access into the mobile home park is limited to an east entrance making the nearest bike trail and public park halfamile and 1.5 miles away travel respectively, leaving the fairway de facto for recreation and exercise.  The fairway occupies the north half of the mobile park, which is lower in elevation and only accessible where the transition is not too steep.  Thirty foot wide streets with no sidewalks line and lead up to the fairway, sloped so that all the runoff flows onto the grass.  The lawn is watered regularly and occasionally inaccessible due to oversaturation, but itâ€™s always green and well manicured by the Wildwood management.


The smell on certain days is unbearable, especially on those scorching days.  â€œSmells like spoiled sausage,â€ as one resident describes it.  Walking through the fairway there are three storm drains transporting water runoff from the landfill.  â€œThose tunnels cross under the freeway,â€ another resident tells me; her twelveyearold sonâ€™s friends took the largest tubular freeway underpass to the other side of the freeway confirming it does.   La Puente Landfill is on the other side of the freeway, at 700 acres and 500 feet tall, it is the largest active landfill in the United States (LA County Sanitation District).  â€œIt has received approximately 118 million tons of solid waste as of April 2008, raising the original site elevation by over 350 feet and earning it the nickname ""Garbage Mountain""â€¦takes 13,000 tons of solid waste per dayâ€¦â€(QED Environmental Systems).  The dump is the backdrop to Wildwood Park.  A closer inspection of Wildwoodâ€™s fairway reveals that it is part of the City of Industry while the rest of Wildwood is considered Hacienda Heights; the fairway is zoned Industrial.  I wonder how many of the residents at Wildwood know that their fairway annex is actually a means of filtering the toxins from La Puenteâ€™s effluence before it enters the San Jose Creek (SJC). 


The City of Industry is a sliver of a city composed of industrial and commercial properties.  A gerrymandered looking city that ranges from one to two miles wide and fourteen miles long, astride the SJC (between the 605 and 57 freeways).  Both a natural and now industrialized corridor, perhaps the name says it all.  The Puente Valley Operable Unit (PVOU), which includes the City of Industry and Wildwood park, was designated an EPA Superfund Site in 1994â€”an area with soil and groundwater contamination (with volatile organic compounds or VOCs) (EPA 2008).  This is one of four sites in the San Gabriel Valley condemned to superfund status, a cleanup project was planned in 1996 to install extraction wells and a treatment plant system at the mouth of the Puente Creek to limit and reduce toxic exposure for area 4, the PVOU (EPA 2008).    Construction began in 2011 in La Puente, three miles NE from Wildwood (EPA 2011).  The planned remediation process takes 1015 years once constructionâ€™s completed (EPA 2011).  


Wildwood is uniquely neglected and requires special attention to help foster an LA that values their residents and their living environmental quality.


A concrete swale runs down the center of the fairway now. To start, spend the money converting it into a bioswale with vegetation, rocks, and a trail.


 


","With 35 years of tradition of thorough environmental research and services to municipalities, NGOs, community organizations and other agencies, California Polytechnic University, Pomona's Master in Landscape Architecture's program has the history and the rigor for delving into projects with complex interactions and intersections of natural and human systems.  The school has a host of 606 projects on their website for more information.","Residents of Wildwood, while living close together, lack much mutual space to interact.  With such varied age groups, family compositions and cultural identities, the park fairways seem rife with opportunities.  Residents should be consulted throughout the design process.


Hacienda Heights Improvement Association: nonprofit association whose goal is â€œto foster and support those projects of development and activity which will improve the quality of life in Hacienda Heights and make it a better place to live.â€


 Los Angeles County Sanitation District.


Community Development Commission of LA (CDC):  Could oversee development of the project.


County Supervisor Knabe: County of Los Angles, Fourth District:  need for County support and fund","Walkability, clean water, bio swales and wetland marshes; all attributes of the imagined finished Wildwood Mobile Home Park proposal.  Constructed wetlands are designed to imitate the functions of a natural wetland but for the express purpose of cleaning water.  Such strategies offer a functional, aesthetic solution; alternatives to the ubiquitous Wildwood fairway lawn that no one should probably sit on.  Success would be treating some of the water on site and re mediating the soil.  I already had a soil test on the fairway done and the results show the fairway soil is high in chloride and metals and the lab recommends leaching the soil further and to periodically apply nitrogen such as with blood meal, feather meal, fish emulsion, etc.


The second goal would be to create a communal space that all the residents can cherish and find a piece of themselves within.  Besides spaces to walk and exercise, communal activity or gathering spaces should be programmed in conjunction with resident input, so to most accurately reflect their desires.  Access into the fairway is also limited and one goal should be to ensure access to all persons.  The more people who use the space the better. 


","Wildwood Mobile Home Country Club Park is at the end of two natural corridors and is also at the end of an industrial corridor, and a direct intervention at Wildwood would quickly impact this depraved community and improve the environmental quality for hundreds:


The San Jose Creek is straddled by the City of Industry.  As is often the case around rivers in Los Angeles, where the soil is unstable and sometimes contaminated, they build mobile homes, golf courses and schools, and itâ€™s where the industrial and rail corridors are.  The industrial corridor in of its business is revealed to be dangerous sometimes.  While many visible occupants in the City of Industry are large chain distribution factories and commercial warehouses, there are some Industrial manufacturing complexes.  One notorious neighbor, Quemetco, is a lead recycling plant and within a mile of the Wildwood entrance.  Ranked #6 of top polluters in California on an EPA â€˜Toxic Release Inventory,â€™ 1,756,634 pounds of total release (of chemical toxins) in a year, includes lead and nitrate compounds (EPA TRI 2011).  Residents have been warned of lead pollution by the companyâ€™s required mailedout literature, of possible arsenic and lead compounds and acid vapors in the air.  But some of us cannot move away so easily, as the expression goes, â€˜we have lead shoes.â€™


The PuenteChino Hills Animal Corridor runs parallel to the elongated City of Industry but to the south and is â€œan unbroken zone of habitat extending nearly 31 miles from the Cleveland National Forest in Orange County to the west end of the Puente Hillsâ€¦30,000 acres of landâ€ (Habitat Authority).   La Puente Landfill funded the preservation authority (tipping fee) to purchase the nearby Puente Hills (Habitat Authority).  A 2005 City of Industry planned development, which cuts off this animal corridor in the middle, reflects a pattern of hostility towards ecological considerations by the City of Industry (Spencer, PuenteChino â€œMissing Middleâ€ Analysis).  Auspiciously, this animal corridor ends at La Puente Landfill, as the only way to connect across the 605 freeway to Whittier Narrows is to fly over or dig under the freeway and through the river (or go through one childsized underground tunnel?).   This also poses an opportunity to provide habitat for wildlife weâ€™d like to attract, like birds.


A solution needs to address both of these issues.  As a rail passes within 300 feet of these mobile homes right passed the fairway, a more substantial barrier could be established. The industrial corridor pollutes enough into the river system; more properties need to treat their toxic runoff on site.  There has to be more creative solutions than golf courses, especially when they are not in use. 


A second solution should address the animal corridor and alternative ground paths to Whittier Narrows.  Some wildlife will be encouraged to visit Wildwood, especially the healthy bird wildlife found in Los Angeles through habitat planning and planting","Environmental Impacts are hard to quantify.  Sometimes it takes big changes for peopleâ€™s perceptions to also change.  LAâ€™s challenge: How can we make LA Rivers a more desirable, multimodal transportation corridor? The possibility for healthy development along our rivers is an important challenge for Los Angeles to take on (which it earnestly does attempt).  The areas by the rivers need to become desirable locations that Angelinos flock to that also fosters natural wildlife habitats and native ecologies, which use wetlands to clean water and provide outdoor, activated spaces that people desire to be in.  This sometimes conflicts with the overlapping interest that all run along the river.  Railroads, freeways, electrical and industrial corridors that also take advantage of the natural ecological corridors, all desire to expand indefinitely; the struggle continues.


My LA 2050 specifically looks passed the shortsightedness of some of these overlapping, conflicting interest towards forward looking projects that seek to find some semblance in the dysfunction and disjunctions in LA towards creating an opportunity for the flourishment of environmental impact.  I see Wildwood as a catalyst project that has such a perverse industrial/residential imposition that it exclaims battery and should get the countyâ€™s attention.  A better transition seems necessary to satisfy the needs of residents to help shield us from the dangers of our location.  The City of Industry is able to move around jurisdictional constraints by snaking along with the SJC, a zone of â€˜special interest,â€™ but this has proven to have real consequences.  These industrial companies need to exist somewhere, but this project wants to confront some of the industrial overreach that seems to infringe on the environmental justice of certain disadvantaged populations.  The LA Sanitation district too, for its part involved in an integrated watershed system with Wildwood, should also seek to assist in this renovation effort.


Success would be a sustained effort to nurture our most disparaged residents and to revitalize the natural corridors."
3102030,2013030,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TurnUptheTurnOut.html,Turn Up the Turn Out: Engaging LAâ€™s Voters through Advanced Technology in LowIncome Neighborhoods, Social Connectedness,"In LA Cityâ€™s March 5th local primary election, only 16% of registered voters cast a ballot, with especially poor turnout in lowincome neighborhoods throughout the City.  





California Calls proposes to reclaim democracy in the City of Angels by significantly increasing voter outreach, education and engagement in Los Angeles.





We will increase the connectedness of LAâ€™s voters by experimenting with both proven and new methods of voter engagement.  Building upon a onetoone voter contact model developed over four years by California Calls, we will engage an estimated 120,000 voters in Los Angeles during 2013.  We expect that by the June 2014 primary election in Los Angeles, the voters we have contacted will demonstrate a 5% to 8% increase in their voting rates as compared to the average voter.





Our program will target South and East Los Angeles, focusing on new, unlikely and occasional voters.  This is a wholly different strategy than most political campaigns which focus on â€œalwaysâ€ voters who are older, more upper income and less racially diverse than Los Angeles.  Our goal is to make the Los Angeles electorate reflect the diversity of LAâ€™s residents.  In turn, this will lead to local elected officials and public policies that better serve the interests of the vast majority of the Cityâ€™s diverse population.





Our proven approach will be supplemented with new technologies to help boost volunteer efficiency and overall voter engagement through three key strategies:





1.	SMART PHONES SPEED UP DOORTODOOR VOTER CONTACT 





California Calls will provide training, technology support and database management to four communitybased organizations in LA County who will visit voters doortodoor in the early Summer and Fall of 2013.  We will equip community volunteers and daily team members with 100 â€œsmart phonesâ€ to greatly increase their efficiency and allow them to contact more voters.  They will:  





â€¢find votersâ€™ addresses quickly by using the phoneâ€™s GIS mapping function 


â€¢input new information about the voter (e.g., phone, email, key interests) into the database, eliminating the need for document scanning 


â€¢go â€œgreenâ€ by eliminating paper documents


â€¢provide team captains with a realtime system to monitor and assist field canvassers 





California Calls plans to contact a total of 24,000 voters at their front door during the two cycles.  The Smart Phones will increase contacts by roughly 10%, expanding our total outreach to 26,400 voters.  We will collect phone numbers, emails and other voter data on all 26,400 voters for ongoing use in voter civic engagement through programs described below.





2.  TELEPHONE TOWN HALLS CONNECT LOWPROPENSITY VOTERS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT





Based on successful experience by U.S. Congresswoman Karen Bass who regularly communicates with her constituents in Los Angeles, we propose a series of five â€œTelephone Town Hallsâ€ with LA voters to introduce them to the new Mayor and new City Council members who will take office on July 1, 2013.  





Using webbased technology, roughly 20,000 voters are dialed in the early evening and invited to listen to a short update from the Mayor or Council representative.  Typically about 10% (2,000) choose to listen.  After a short presentation, voters are invited to ask questions and discuss.  The Telephone Town Hall can offer live translation into Spanish and other languages.





We propose to conduct five Telephone Town Halls during 2013 with voters in South and East Los Angeles, reaching about 10,000 voters.  We will hold one Citywide TeleTown Hall with the new Mayor and four TeleTown Halls with Council representatives from districts where our four community organizations are located.  





This new technology provides a unique and meaningful opportunity for voters to connect to their elected representatives, and provides California Calls and its member groups an opportunity to identify and involve voters who express interest in civic affairs for future followup.





3.   VOTER OUTREACH  PHONEBANK USING DIALER  TECHNOLOGY





California Calls will add one Voter Outreach Phone bank to its 2013 program to contact an additional 23,000 LA voters.  We use a sophisticated, largescale predictive dialing system which eliminates answering machines and â€œnot homesâ€, and puts phoners directly into conversation with â€œliveâ€ voters.





The four LAbased groups who contact voters will survey them on current policy issues and invite them to the TelephoneTown Halls and other community meetings.  Interested voters will also become part of California Callsâ€™ database file for use in mobilizing voter turnout for the June 2014 gubernatorial primary election.





By integrating these three advanced technologies with the â€œhuman touchâ€ that is offered by our community volunteers and team members, we will expand our LA voter outreach by more than 35,000 contacts, for a total civic engagement program of nearly 120,000 voters.","California Calls is a statewide alliance of communitybased organizations working to win systemic public policy reforms to achieve progressive taxation, stable funding for public services, government responsiveness to community needs, and highroad economic growth.   With 31 community groups organized in 11 strategic counties, California Calls is mounting a longterm, ambitious civic engagement program to build a powerful base of voters in lowincome and immigrant communities of color, with a special focus on educating and turning out new, occasional and young voters.





California Calls member organizations work on many issues: health and human services, education, immigrantâ€™s rights, environmental justice, housing, jobs, living wages.  In addition to the electoral mobilization program, the member organizations employ a broad range of strategies to advance their work: grassroots community organizing, leadership development, policy research, direct action, legislative advocacy, and public policy campaigns.  





The longterm goal of California Calls is to develop a bottomup statewide alliance of organizations with the power to turn out 500,000 supporters of progressive tax and fiscal reforms who normally do not participate in elections.  In addition, California Calls actively works to build collaborations with other statewide organizations who share the same vision of renewing the â€œCalifornia Dreamâ€ wherein the state can offer a world class public education system, a vital social safety net, and a modern public infrastructure to support dynamic and sustainable economic growth.





Since 2009, California Calls has identified more than 574,000 unlikely voters in 11 counties across the state who express support for progressive tax and budget policies.  In November 2012, the California Calls Action Fund supported Proposition 30 (see video), a ballot measure which has already generated over $6 billion annually for Californiaâ€™s K12 schools and the UC/CSU higher education systems.  Through a massive â€œground gameâ€ of getoutthevote activities, California Calls contacted 293,613 voters, of which 80% made it to the polls!  This compared with average statewide voter turnout of only 71%.  These voters represented a crucial margin of victory, providing over 3% of the statewide vote total for new funding for education, social service and public safety programs.  





Key groups of historically underrepresented constituencies voted at even higher margins:  





â€¢	Among young voters age 25 to 34, California Calls supporters voted at a rate of 72% compared to the statewide average of only 57%a 15% point increase!


â€¢AfricanAmerican voters identified by California Calls as supporters participated at a rate of 85%, compared to 67% of AfricanAmerican voters statewideâ€”an 18% point increase!  


â€¢Immigrant voters identified by California Calls as supporters participated at an average rate of 81%, compared to a statewide average of 68%a 13% point increase


","Four community groups are members of California Calls and will lead the onetoone voter contact to engage lowincome Latino, AfricanAmerican and Asian Pacific Islander voters.  All have years of community organizing experience in their neighborhoods:





â€¢	Association of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), South LA, Watts and central LA; 


â€¢	Community Coalition (COCO), South Los Angeles; 


â€¢	Inner City Struggle (ICS), East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights; 


â€¢	Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE), South LA.





California Calls will provide centralized training, equipment purchase, database management and support to the local organizations, helping to increase efficiency and overall impact.


","California Calls is a metricsdriven organization.  We use sophisticated data analysis, tracking, reporting and realtime evaluation methods to gauge whether we are meeting our numeric targets for voter contacts, identification and education.





Since the founding of California Calls in 2009, we have developed a number of systems for monitoring and measuring our strategy, activities and performance.  These include:





a.  Voter Contacts Made Per Volunteer or Team Member:  Now that we have conducted 10 cycles of civic engagement programs across the state, we know that a high performance phone bank volunteer or team member should be able to contact XX number of voters per hour.  Doortodoor contacts are much more labor intensive, but should reach an average of XX per hour.  We monitor these voter contact rates on a daily basis during the program. 





b.  Voter Contacts Made Per Organization:  We work with our member community organizations to set ambitious, yet realistic goals for voter contact.  Once we agree to a plan, California Calls trains, supports and monitors the local organization for the duration.  The local organization monitors and coordinates the daily volunteers and team members.  If an organization is falling behind, California Calls will intervene with added training, support and assistance to help meet the target goals.





c.  Voter Analysis:  We are experts in working with data from the LA City Clerk, LA County Registrar of Voters and a private voter information vendor to track voter participation and turnout rates.  For the proposed program, we would compare the voter statistics from the upcoming June 2014 Gubernatorial Election to the Citywide (or Countywide) voting average to measure our impact.  We may also compare to earlier (November 2010 or November 2012) election data, with the proviso that there are many mitigating factors.  We would expect to see an increase in voter turnout amongst our target voters of between 5 to 8% compared to the Citywide average. 





d.  Voter Telephone Town Hall Participation Rates & Reoccurrence:  This is a new technology and approach to increase voter engagement.  We would track and evaluate the following information:  





â€¢	number of voters contacted to participate; 


â€¢	number of voters choosing to participate in teleconference;


â€¢	average number of minutes that voter stays on teleconference call;


â€¢	number of voters who request ongoing notification of Telephone Town Halls


â€¢	number of voters who return to participate in future Telephone Town Halls


â€¢	number of Town Hall voters who actually vote in future elections





We would expect to see a direct correlation and increase between those voters who choose to participate in the Town Halls and their voting behavior.


","California Callsâ€™ voter engagement program will help to reclaim the democratic process that now belongs to special interests, lobbyists and campaign committees.  We encourage lowincome voters to exercise their democratic right to vote with stunning success.  The simple reason is that our â€œmessengersâ€â€”the volunteers and team members who reach out to votersâ€”are peers.  Through the communitybased organizations which operate these programs, young, bilingual people of color serve as doortodoor canvassers and phone bankers who talk to voters.  They establish a rapport that earns the trust of skeptical voters.





By engaging voters consistently in understanding crucial public policy issues (not only during election cycles), the California Calls model of voter engagement will produce several direct benefits:





a.  Advance Policies to Benefit LowIncome People:  Our member organizations  (see below)  have outstanding track records winning significant benefits for lowincome communities throughout Los Angeles, including:





â€¢	reducing the number of nuisance liquor stores and transient motels; 


â€¢	assuring that all high schools offer collegeprep courses and adequate college counselors; 


â€¢	negotiating with large companiesâ€”like Dreamworksâ€”to provide jobs and apprenticeship training for inner city youth; 


â€¢	designing an energy conservation program for publiclyowned buildings that trains inner city youth in â€œgreenâ€ construction;


â€¢	creating programs for homeowners to avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes


â€¢	closing toxic and harmful factories next to schools





The proposed voter outreach program will enable all four community organizations to identify and recruit local residents to become involved in ongoing campaigns and to develop their leadership skills.





b.  Increase Voter Turnout so LAâ€™s Electorate Reflects Our Population:  





The California Callâ€™s model of civic engagement targets new and occasional voters in lowincome Latino, AfricanAmerican and immigrant neighborhoods.  By increasing the voting participation rate of these residents, our program will help to insure that policies and candidates will more closely reflect the views and desires of residents of Los Angelesâ€”the true meaning of democracy.  Especially in local elections where turnout rates are historically low, this program can create a tipping point for greater representation of lowincome communities.





c.  Create Accountability for Elected Representatives through an Informed Citizenry





California Calls will increase accountability and transparency of elected representatives by creating a more informed and engaged citizenry.  Our Telephone Town Halls will provide voters with the opportunity to hear directlyâ€”and engage directlyâ€”with the Cityâ€™s new Mayor, new City Council members and other elected officials.  The ongoing education and discussion through doortodoor canvassing and highcapacity phone outreach will increase the level of voter understanding on key issues.


","By 2050, we envision that Los Angeles would continue to evolve as a global city with one of the most diverse and international populations of any world megalopolis.  But, in contrast to today, we would expect to see one of the most active and engaged citizenries in the world.  





Through consistent, disciplined voter outreach and education, we would expect to see vastly higher rates of voter participation than now.  We think that with a 5% increase in the voter turnout rate per major election, by 2050, it is entirely possible to see the Los Angeles electorate truly reflect the diversity of its population local and state elections.





Through ongoing doortodoor and phone outreach, the increased use of technology and social media, combined with popular education on everyday issues, we would expect to see a thriving culture of communitybased organizations that engage with residents on a daily basis on the key issues of the day.





And, as a result of increased civic participation at all levels, we would hope to see policies and programs in the City of Angels that end homelessness, hunger, and violenceâ€”and launch us on the path towards equality, opportunity, and environmental sustainability for all.

3102031,2013031,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BLOOM.html,Building a Lifetime of Options and Opportunities for Men (BLOOM) , Education,"BLOOM is a bold initiative of the California Community Foundation (CCF). BLOOM seeks to support Black male youth (14 â€“ 18 years old) who have been involved with the L.A. County probation system. By 2017, BLOOM will serve 2,000 of these youth with a specific focus on steering them away from the justice system and helping them complete high school, enter postsecondary education and earn taxable income. The end game is simple: school completion and jobs! BLOOM represents a landmark as the ONLY major philanthropic initiative in the country focused on Black male youth involved in the juvenile delinquency system. 





BLOOM seeks to have a minimum of 60% of youth served complete high school and pursue postsecondary education/training. This projected outcome is considerably higher than the current rate of 25% (high school completion) for probationinvolved youth.  Additionally, our expectation is that as more youth complete high school, more of them will be prepared to obtain meaningful employment and earn taxable income. To accomplish this, CCF intends to open avenues of access to educational and employment opportunities for 1418 year old Black males, real and immediate opportunities such as academic support, scholarships, internships and jobs.  





BLOOM targets Black male youth who have been on probation because this is arguably the most vulnerable of any subgroup in Los Angeles County. The statistics reveal a grim reality:


â€¢ Black youth make up a disproportionate percentage of youth on  


  probation and in prison.  Specifically, while they represent 10 


  percent of the countyâ€™s youth population, they comprise 33 percent 


  of all youth under probation supervision;  


â€¢ In general, only 25% of youth on probation graduate from high 


  school;  


â€¢ It is projected that one in four Black males will be involved with the 


  criminal justice system in their lifetime, while only one in 10 will 


  graduate from a fouryear college;  


â€¢ It is estimated that for each cohort of 120,000 young adults each 


  year that become part of the population that will never complete 


  high school, they will cost California $46.4 billion in total economic 


  losses over their lifetimes; and  


â€¢ In general, 45% percent of Blacks in Los Angeles County are either  


  unemployed or not in the labor force, the highest among any 


  racial/ethnic subgroup in the area.  





BLOOM invests in promoting Educational and Job Opportunity for youth in three ways: (1) academic/vocational advancement; (2) creation of a jobs pipeline; and (3) careerbased mentoring. Investments are made through subgrants to local nonprofit organizations serving this population, and in partnership with other nonprofits, foundations, corporations, and concerned individuals. Through these grants, nonprofit organizations and the local 


business community make an intentional, concentrated effort to reshape the trajectory of these youth by supporting them complete school, getting them job ready and ultimately placed in jobs. BLOOM provides the support and direction organizations need to embark on such efforts. Often times, efforts to support young Black men and boys are pursued one of two ways: (1) within a general framework to serve people of color in general or (2) under the auspices of a specific issue area (e.g., education). However, the wide disparities that persist in outcomes for Black male youth signal a need to take on a more concerted, focused effort.  BLOOM is poised to demonstrate what a concentrated, intentional, and focused effort can achieve for young Black men.


","Since implementation in May 2012, our five service partners have enrolled 105 BLOOM youth into their respective programs. We are planning to add at least four more service partners in June 2013. We will continue to add partners over the next couple of years to help us reach our projected target number of 2,000 youth served by 2017.





Our â€œBLOOMersâ€ are being provided with unique opportunities. As part of our partnersâ€™ program models, BLOOMers not only have positive connections to male mentors but also spend more than 100 hours undergoing selfactualization training which includes leadership development, cultural enrichment, and guidance on succeeding in school and the workplace and other important topics.





Two BLOOMers earned an exclusive opportunity to participate in the sixweek AEG Job Shadowing program. The program takes place from February 20 through March 15. This exclusive opportunity is only offered to one out of every 2,000 high school students in Los Angeles.  The program will allow BLOOMers an opportunity for regular exposure to the daily operations behind one of the most successful entertainment companies in the world while learning critical job skills that will make them competitive in the workplace.





The following profile provides just one example of our BLOOMers (the name has been changed to protect confidentiality of the youth). 





James is completing his senior year at Evans Community Learning Center in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. James is on probation for being involved with a grand theft auto incident. He would like to attend San Diego State University in the fall.  His interests lie in Human Behavior and Philosophy.  James has participated in community service activities such as feeding the homeless and neighborhood beautification projects. People who meet James find it hard to believe he has any association to Probation.  However, James recently shared that, â€œI thought I was living life the way it was supposed to be lived in the innercity. I just didnâ€™t know better. I now realize there are options and opportunities.â€





In conjunction with LAGRANT COMMUNICATIONS, CCF has produced print and radio media placements and materials to expand BLOOMâ€™s messaging.  Examples of such placements include:  KJLH radio (radio spots by BLOOM spokesperson Larenz Tate), The Huffington Post, California Crusader, and coverage on KABC7 Eyewitness News at 6 pm. BLOOM is also one of five philanthropic initiatives featured in Where Do We Go from Here?: Philanthropic Support for Black Men and Boys, a report published in October 2012 by The Foundation Center.  The report examines U.S. foundation giving explicitly in support of Black males by issue area, type of support, and geographic area served. The analyses explore patterns of giving by larger U.S. foundations over the past eight years, with a focus on giving from 2008 to 2010.


 ","The BLOOM Alliance consists of five service partners:


1. Brotherhood Crusade


2. Los Angeles Urban League


3. Youth Mentoring Connection


4. Community Coalition


5. Youth Justice Coalition





Three other partners are focused on specific aspects of BLOOM: 


1. Liberty Hill Foundation (providing capacity building support for 


    our service partners)


2. LAGRANT COMMUNICATIONS (conducting outreach to the 


   community and increased visibility to BLOOM)


3. An evaluation team from UCLA (responsible for ongoing tracking 


   of overall progress)





Some of our partners that have committed to provide job opportunities for BLOOM youth include:


1. McDonald's


2. United Parcel Service (UPS)


3. Buffalo Wild Wings


4. AEG


5. LA Metro Transportation Authority","To measure the BLOOMâ€™s impact, CCF enlisted an evaluation team from UCLA's Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities (CHCFC), a multidisciplinary research, policy and training institute with faculty from the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Public Affairs. The team has a combined record of more than 60 years of communitybased evaluation, with clients including the Probation Department, Department of Children and Family Services and Homeboy Industries. The purpose of the evaluation is not only to assess the effectiveness and impact of BLOOMâ€™s strategic investments but also identify any potential adjustments needed during the course of the fiveyear initiative. Shortterm progress is based on a quarterly data collection and tracking process. This aggregated data will allow ongoing tracking of youth related to school enrollment, school achievement, job training/readiness, job placement and income. This data will be used in various ways to inform key stakeholders about BLOOMâ€™s progress toward the longterm vision of school completion and jobs for Black male youth.  Longterm progress will be tracked based on a set of specified outcomes and indicators. These outcomes include: (1) 60% of youth will complete high school, (2) 50% of youth 18 years and older will earn taxable income, and (3) 60% of youth will develop a sustained relationship with a health adult male role model. Throughout the five years, the UCLA evaluation team will produce an annual evaluation report and other reports as needed. Based on the findings, there could be strategic refinements, which in turn could result in revised metrics.","Support for BLOOM benefits Los Angeles in three ways:





1. There is a growing movement in philanthropy to invest in a more 


    focused way to address the challenges facing young Black men 


    and boys. Along with The California Endowmentâ€™s Boys and Men 


    of Color focus and The California Wellness Foundationâ€™s Violence 


    Prevention Initiative, BLOOM is an instrumental part of L.A.â€™s 


    philanthropic efforts to address the disparities in outcomes for 


    Black male youth. 





2. Given Los Angeles often sets the pace for identifying solutions to 


    challenges that impact our nation in general, lessons learned from 


    Los Angeles can serve as a testing ground to address two of our 


    nationâ€™s most pressing needs: (1) cost effective alternatives in the 


    face of fiscal constraints; and (2) the urgency to positively alter the 


    trajectory of systeminvolved Black youth.  





3. Lastly, there are more than 800,000 Blacks residing in Los Angeles 


   County. We can ill afford to have a significant segment of this 


   population (i.e., Black male youth) continue to underachieve and 


   missing the opportunity to become selfsufficient, taxpaying 


   citizens of our community. L.A.â€™s national and global 


   competiveness is inextricably linked to these outcomes as we 


   approach the year 2050. 


","How are young Black men supposed to become selfsufficient, taxpaying, contributing members of society when quality education, job training and fulltime employment constantly take a back seat to community violence and discrimination against them?     





Imagine a community in which all young people have hope and opportunity to be gainfully employed and contributing members of society. 





What if we could save Californiaâ€™s economy $40 billion by redirecting just one percent of the stateâ€™s dropouts to become high school graduates? 





In 2050, I envision educational outcomes for Black male youth (and all other outcomes that are indicators of positive wellbeing) that are proportionate to their percentage within the general population. For example, if Black male youth make up 5% of the overall L.A. County youth population, they will comprise 5% of the countyâ€™s high school graduates.  If the general high school graduation rate for L.A. County students is 70%, I envision at least 70% of all Black male youth graduating from high school. Only when this occurs will be able to make a legitimate claim that all young people have equal access and opportunity to thrive and participate in mainstream community life. 





BLOOM is about instilling confidence and ambition into all Black male youth, beginning in South L.A.  This is not a program for the best and the brightest â€“ itâ€™s about putting aside our stereotypes and prejudice, and investing in the potential of all kids, regardless of what has happened to them.  Itâ€™s about believing that we all deserve REAL opportunity and support at being a productive citizen. L.A. County and our nation have billions in savings riding on it. 





The following video clip tells the story of just one of many BLOOMers who deserve such an opportunity:

3102032,2013032,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MillionBagGiveaway.html,The Million Reusable Bag Giveaway, Environmental Quality,"California Greenworks, in partnership with Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries, proposes the â€œMillion Reusable Bag Giveawayâ€ pilot program, to create and distribute 25,000 reusable shopping bags (with an overall goal of 4 million) in lowerincome Los Angeles neighborhoods as the Cityâ€™s plastic bag ban goes into effect.  Using informational inserts in the bags, we will spread the word about costsaving and environmentallyurgent energy efficiency and water conservation programs.  





This program will positively impact at least four LA 2050 indicators by:





1) immediately increasing stable Income & Employment of two of LAâ€™s most atrisk populations: homeless, disabled and returning combat veterans, and formerlygang involved and recentlyincarcerated men and women; 





2) Educating lowincome and traditionally difficulttoreach populations about new energy efficiency and water conservation measures introduced by the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP), thereby helping reduce their monthly utility and weekly shopping billsâ€¦





3) â€¦while improving Environmental Quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in terms of electricity and water use, and reducing the use of singleuse shopping bags which often become blight and part of the litter stream in our neighborhoods and waterways;





4) and building a bridge of Social Connectedness between two previously disparate communities who share similar challenges around assimilation and acceptance into the mainstream Los Angeles society.





The Million Reusable Bag Giveaway pilot project will employ Green Vets LA veterans in making 25,000 reusable shopping bags, and Homeboy Industries in silkscreening them, and will engage City Councilmembers, Los Angeles neighborhood councils, faithbased and community groups and environmental organizations such as the Clean Seas Coalition, the Green LA Coalition and the LA Climate Action Coalition in distributing the bags.  





Once the pilot project is up and running, California Greenworks will continue the â€œMillion Bagsâ€ fundraising process by involving local businesses (such as grocery stores, local utilities such as LADWP, sports teams such as the Dodgers, film studios, et al) to sponsor the project in exchange for their logos being imprinted upon durable shopping bags that will be used weekly by Los Angeles consumers for the five to ten year expected life of these durable shopping bags.  





The ultimate goals of the Million Bag project are to provide a free reusable shopping bag, with energy efficiency and water conservation tips within it, to every one of the nearly four million residents in the City of Los Angeles, to substantially reduce electricity and water use across the City, reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the threat of climate change looms, and, in the process, to create a sustainable sewing and silk screening industry staffed by atrisk populations who will benefit from a growing trend of plastic bag ban ordinances spreading across California, the United States and the world.


","California Greenworks has established itself as one of the premier environmental groups within South Los Angeles. California Greenworks directs its efforts to the atrisk communities in South Los Angeles.  Our projects revolve around environmental education programs, revitalization of urban open spaces to reduce blight, promotion of water quality and advocacy for green jobs.  





The following are a few of California Greenworks programs and initiatives:





 EarthFestLA â€“ Annual Concert for the Environment & Expo â€“ Beginning in 2006, California Greenworks produced its first environmental fair in the City of Watts, then called â€œSouth LA Earth Day Festival.â€  Since then, EarthFestLA has become an annual, familyoriented event focusing on environmental education and community health awareness.  Website for EarthFest LA 2012: www.EarthFestLA.org.





 Communitybased Energy Efficiency Water Outreach Program (through the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power)  California Greenworks received a 2013 $45,000 grant to do an extensive grassroots outreach effort to spread information about energy efficiency and water conservation to LADWP customers in South Los Angeles.





 Compton Creek Watershed Pollution Prevention Partnership Program â€“ This firstofitskind watershed pollution prevention partnership is a twoyear project sponsored by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, geared to raise community awareness of watershed pollution prevention.  Polluted water and trash flowing into storm drains is the greatest danger to the wellbeing of birds and animals that live in the coastal wetlands drained by Compton Creek Watershed.  The partnership provides a low impact solution by installing storm drain catch basins and screens preventing trash from entering the waterways.





 Water Links! Urban Youth Watershed Education Program â€“ An environmental education program that links the urban watershed to the ocean, targeted to the 5th grade student.  This 4week pilot program raises awareness for environmental stewardship, pollution prevention, and water conservation within the urban communities. 


","Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries have both committed to working with California Greenworks in this effort.  





Green Vets LA is a nonprofit organization that is working with Veterans from the West Los Angeles VA Hospital to provide job training and work therapy to injured and noninjured and even homeless Veterans in a supportive environment.  This program offers a wide variety of job trainings, including sewing reusable bags, and has helped Veterans successfully reenter the work force upon returning from military service.     www.greenvetsla.com





Homeboy Industries serves highrisk, formerly ganginvolved men and women with a continuum of free services and programs, and operates seven social enterprises that serve as jobtraining site","The successful implementation of the whole of this pilot project will be measured in several ways:





1) The successful creation and distribution of 25,000 reusable shopping bags to lowerincome communities for their use before the Cityâ€™s plastic bag ban goes into effect, likely in early 2014.  Having free shopping bags will allow lowerincome families to shop without worrying about being impacted by having to pay themselves for reusable bags (in the absence of free, singleuse plastic bags, or having to pay the 10 cent charge for paper bags, as mandated by the Cityâ€™s singleuse bag ordinance).





2) A successful pilot project will allow the incremental growth of this effort from 25,000 bags to 4 million bags.





3) California Greenworks will request a baseline electricity and wateruse reading from the LA Department of Water and Power in the City Council districts in which the bags will be distributed before and then after the bags (and therefore the energy efficiency and water conservation information) are distributed in order to track the effectiveness of the educational materials.  Additionally, LADWP will be able track the number of customers who apply to their energy efficiency programs as a result of this pilot project to gauge its effectiveness toward the Cityâ€™s overall energy efficiency goals.





4) The most important matrix by which California Greenworks will gauge the success of this program is the additional Vets and formerlygang involved men and women who are hired to work at good, wellpaying jobs in these supportive work environments.


","BUILD EMPLOYMENT AMONG ATRISK COMMUNITIES





Both Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries provide good jobs in a supportive atmosphere to atrisk communities which need strong support.  The Million Bag Giveaway pilot project will provide predictable workflow for both companies to make 25,000 reusable bags for 3 months as California Greenworks raises funds toward the eventual goal of giving away 4 million reusable bags, one for each resident of the City of Los Angeles.  A fullyfunded order for 4 million bags will then provide financial backing to create a stronger infrastructure for both companies to increase hiring from these two worthy atrisk communities, so that they might build out their reusable bag manufacturing infrastructure and prepare them to fill more orders in the future as plastic bag ban trend spreads from city to city across the United States. 





PROVIDE FREE REUSABLE GROCERY BAGS TO LOWERINCOME COMMUNITIES AS PLASTIC BAGS ARE PHASED OUT





The Million Bag Giveaway pilot project builds upon the environmental success of the Cityâ€™s ban on singleuse plastic bags by providing, free of charge, reusable bags for lowerincome residents, so that everyone can celebrate the success of cleaning blight out of our neighborhoods and waste out of our rivers and oceans without being concerned about the 10 cent fee that will be charged at the grocery store for the use of singleuse paper bags.  





HELP COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY SPREADING ENERGY EFFICIENCY





LADWP has announced its historic goal to move the City of Los Angeles completely off of coal power by 2025 and dramatically reduce the Cityâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions well below 1990 levels.  To accomplish that effectively, the City must meet robust energy efficiency goals among all communities.  The project provides an educational pamphlet distributed within each bag, giving residents information and tips on LADWPfunded energy efficiency and water conservation programs, so that the environmental benefits to the City can be even larger while simultaneously shrinking utility bills for customers.  





BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES





The Million Bag Giveaway Project will build a bridge of Social Connectedness and shared goals between two previously disparate communities who share similar challenges around assimilation and acceptance into mainstream society.


","In the best case scenario, by the year 2050, there will be no need for Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries, as there will be no war, no gang violence and we will have become welleducated in being much improved stewards of our planet.





However, falling short of that, the successful outgrowth of the Million Bag Giveaway Project, by 2050, will result in Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries both spreading into all fifty states, supporting combat veterans and formerly ganginvolved men and women in a myriad of employment opportunities, which in turn help benefit the environment.  





Energy efficiency and water conservation has increased to a level in 2050 where we live in a zero waste community.  We use only clean technologies to power our homes and vehicles and thrive using only the water we collect that falls from the sky.  Climate change has been mitigated to the point that its effects are only scarcely noticeable.





Singleuse items, such as plastic bags, will have become a thing of the past, as, by 2050, all members of society have learned the environmental consequences of their daily habits and purchasing choices.  





The current members of these two organizations â€“ Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries â€“ who may only now, in 2013, be assimilating into the productive workforce, will grow into leadership roles, help lead both organizations and our great country into the year 2100.

3102033,2013033,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/collegeheadstart.html,CARECENs College Head Start, Education,"CARECENâ€™s College Head Start program is designed to monitor participating students from 8th through 12th grade to ensure they are primed for high school graduation, college admission and academic success. According to an LAUSD Policy Bulletin, in 2012 all 9th graders will be required to complete the AG Requirement in order to graduate from high school. At times, many students have found it difficult to complete this requirement, thus setting up students to either â€œflunk outâ€ or completely disengage from school and drop out. Admission to CARECENâ€™s College Head Start program will require family involvement and a commitment to academic and disciplinary guidelines. Program Objective: To create a sustainable high school impact program that is geared to support students from 8th through 12th grade, by monitoring their academic progress and ensuring access to needed academic support to earn a high school diploma and prepare to attend a university, community college, vocational and/or trade school. Program Services: Students enrolled in CARECENâ€™s College Head Start program will receive the following services: 1. Academic Enrichment/Tutoring; 2. Academic Counseling/Internships 3. College Admissions Guidance 4. College Success and Retention Support 5. Financial Aid Counseling 6. Parent and Family Services 7. Leadership Development 8. Academic /Career Mentoring 9. SAT/ACT and Other Test Preparation Services 10. Scholarship Information. Target Population: College Head Start participants will be composed of: 9th through 12th grade high school students. However, outreach and promotion for the program will begin with middle school students (8th grade students transitioning into 9th grade); academically high and low performing; first generation students to attend college; students/families with limited financial resources, English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learner (ELL) students, and AB540 students.  In the first phase of the program, CARECEN will recruit students from Belmont High Schoolâ€™s Small Learning Communities (Belmont).  Belmont is one of LAUSDâ€™s most underperforming schools, with a graduation rate of 34%. Because Belmont is within a fivemile radius of CARECEN, we felt it was important to collaborate with them and procure a solid freshman class to participate in College Head Start and ultimately graduate high school and pursue higher academics.  Once fully established, the program will include approximately 75 students from 9th to 12th grades. Program Structure:  CARECEN has developed its curriculum to address and meet the needs of PicoUnion/Westlake students. CARECENâ€™s College Head Start model focuses on two areas:  1. Academic: The academic component has students working within a study group that is facilitated by a College Head Start tutor. Students will be grouped with other students who are taking the same course subjects and will collaborate to study the materials. For additional support or upon referral from a College Head Start counselor, students can request oneonone tutoring with an academic tutor. 2. Leadership: Students will participate in a leadership development program where they will receive the necessary tools to become community leaders and advocates. The following are areas within the leadership program: Community Service: This component focuses on connecting students with their community. Students will work with College Head Start counselors and community leaders to seekout a project and/or organization that best suits them in an effort to complete their volunteer hours. Given the three Belmont Academies, students will be required to do community projects based on the theme for their academy. In addition, College Head Start counselors will inform and assist students regarding internship opportunities, which they will be able to be incorporate on their resumes. History, Culture and Art: This component will focus on exploring the issue of identity, building studentsâ€™ selfesteem and confidence, to enable them to graduate from high school. In the end, students will feel they are emotionally prepared for college and will most likely succeed through a seminar series based on Latino immigrant history, culture and the arts. Parents: CARECEN realizes that in order to better serve the needs of our children and youth, parents are a critical partner and have their own set of needs as they work to become better advocates who fight for their childâ€™s education. In response to a great community need, CARECEN developed the Parent Leadership Program. This program educates parents on the basic knowledge regarding the function and structure of the school system in order to support their childrenâ€™s education and develop an Individual Academic Plan to help students successfully graduate and be ready to attend a college or university. Parents will also learn how to advocate and fight for an equal and quality public education system and improved collaboration between parents and schools. 





","For 30 years, CARECEN has worked to empower the Central American and Latino immigrant community to fight for social and economic justice. Part of that fight has been to ensure that the children in our communities receive a quality education and cultural teachings. Through educational reform advocacy, educational programs, and active roles in the design and implementation of new school structures, CARECEN seeks solutions everyday to the obstacles our youth face in achieving success and in the development of the arts and culture component that defines their and that of their families personal struggle. 


Currently CARECEN offers an Art & Culture Program for children and youth in the Pico Union/Westlake Community, as well as, a dedicated Parent Center, which provides families education around the role of community schools. Each program is based around the need of the community to never lose sight of the roots of their native culture and an indepth analysis of the continuous struggle for immigrant children to receive a quality education. 


CARECEN has offered after school programs for youth since 1992; then called, Nueva Generacion (New Generation), the original program was focused on helping youth learn work skills and become familiar with the computer. In 1998, when the agency moved into its 30,000sq.ft community center it was able to expand the age range of participants as well as the programs offered. From 1998 until today, education programs have included academic enrichment, cultural projects, a summer youth program, parent involvement, field trips and a special focus on being collegeready.


With the continuous educational cutbacks on all levels (local, state and federal), schools within a 510 mile radius of CARECEN will experience continuous setbacks, for example â€“ the cuts to arts and culture, parent centers and academic enrichment programs. Given this reality, CARECEN feels it is important to open its doors to the community and provide children and youth the best educational experience during their lengthy break from school.


","We are working with neighborhood middle schools and high schools located within 5mile radius from the organization.  We will also seek to collaborate with key universities programs such as student retention departments to assist students and parents in the college transition phase. We have strong partnerships with LAUSD, Belmont High School, University of Southern California (USC), UCLA, Cal State LA and local community colleges.","Success will be evaluated on different levels, from student engagement in workshops to the number of students that graduated from a 4year college or higher education institution. Childrenâ€™s achievements cannot be measured on numbers alone because then we would not be celebrating the personal growth of each student. Yet, we track our students from the moment they start in to the day they graduate from college. We have discovered that there is much discussion on high school dropout rates, but there is not a lot of awareness of college dropout in our community. Therefore, we measure success in 3 main sections: 1. Personal and social growth 2. Academic achievement and college readiness 3. College/higher education retention and completion.","CARECENâ€™s youth and parent programs benefit the city of Los Angeles by creating a space where families can grow together as a union in pursuing a higher education and creating leaders that are active in addressing issues that affect their community. CARECENâ€™s education programs strive to create a space where both parents and youth can work together to address student needs that exist at local schools and the community.


Students participating in College Head Start will be able to receive the academic, emotional, and financial education support that students are currently lacking in the schools. Given recent changes and cuts students often find themselves confused and unprepared to meet new standards and have nowhere to go for assistance. CARECEN has been in the Pico Union/Westlake community for 30 years and is a trusted organization where immigrant families go for help. College Head Start and the parent programs address these needs and fill the void left by the devastating cuts schools have suffered in recent years. 


CARECEN's youth programs give students and their families the tools they need to work and advocate for quality education, the support to strive for college and the leadership training makes them aware of issues affecting their community and how they can work to change it. 


We believe that families will change and improve Los Angeles. We want to ensure that our youth are better prepared for success and that they have the support of their parents to improve their lives and therefore, their community.


CARECEN programs create a safe space for dialogue that helps bridge the gap created by migration, cultural, language and generational differences. It is important not to only have an informed student or to only have an informed parent but both working as a team in building a better future for everyone. 


","With every generation of students that we help get into an institute of higher education the face of the Los Angeles student will be changed. Students will learn to take ownership of their education and be proud to be members of our evergrowing city. Students will learn to dream big, work hard, and give back to their community. In 2050 we hope to see a community that actively encourages students in their pursuit of a higher education."
3102034,2013034,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/cartel.html,cARTel: Collaborative Arts LAs ToDo List,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Our idea is to solidify our company as a sustainable arts organization whose focus is on emerging arts professionals. We believe that in LA, there are two types of arts events: the heavily funded, well attended, and smoothly run event geared towards established artists and celebrities; and the unsupported, sparsely attended, poorly managed event for emerging artists. Our mission bridges the two: creating artistic opportunities for thrilling and boundarypushing artists that will allow them to create on a bigger, better supported level. Now is the time for us to take the next step in our mission. Each year, we engage hundreds of artists, creators and collaborators  and in order to fully invest in artist and art administrators potential, we need the funding to be able to support them on a monetary level. 





But first, a little bit about us: cARTelâ€™s attracts those not interested solely in performing or watching, but rather in sharing the experience of art with one another. Since 2007, we have produced 22 theatrical productions, 6 music and film festivals, several oneday events such as poetry readings and collaborative mixers, and 2 installation art shows featuring the work of over 2000 multimedia LA area artists. Our work has been covered by the LA Times, NBCLA, Huffington Post, LAist, LA Weekly, The Examiner, and countless blogs and digital hubs. Our Artistic Director, Negin Singh, was featured on the White House blog, â€œWinning the Future: Obama and Young Americansâ€ and was named one of the top 20 IndianAmerican Entrepreneurs for 2012 in India Currents Magazine. Our company values include:





Affordability and accessibility. If we canâ€™t afford the price of a ticket, we donâ€™t put it on. 


We only produce original work by daring artists and promote collaboration as the driving energy behind the creative process. 


The event has to be logistically sound and provide a safe, exciting platform for the artists success.


Process is as important as product. Throughout the creation and planning process, artists and staff alike need to feel comfortable and pushed with respect, patience and fun!





Where we are now: We have succeeded in creating a model that attracts artists and audiences to participate in challenging and exciting artmaking that is new and comes with few guidelines. Right now, cARTel administrators and artists need to MAKE time out of their hectic schedules to support the mission, which means that though we do a lot already, we can do a LOT MORE. With appropriate funding, we will focus more of our time on expansion of our core programming, free workshops, mentorship programs, a physical space, as well as experiment with new events!





Our programs: 





BROKECHELLA MUSIC & ARTS FESTIVAL


What began at a coffee house with 50 people has now grown to a street festival for over 2000. Brokechella is a oneday extravaganza that will feature 38 of LAâ€™s finest emerging musical talent chosen from over 300 submissions. Music, gourmet street food, art installations, boutique vendors, games, and more  all for under $10. 





NO BUDGET FILM FESTIVAL


Beg, borrow, collaborate; NBFF takes indie filmmaking back to its roots. A red carpet event at the Downtown Independent, last yearâ€™s edition debuted the Bonus Features panel series featuring some of todayâ€™s trailblazing voices and industry heavyweights from major networks and film fests. 





GENDER LAB


Our annual ensemblebased production returns in summer 2013 for the multimedia performance 'Gender Lab.' An ensemble of artists will use dance, visual art, poetry, food and more to create a sensory experience that asks the question, ""How much of a wo/man are you?""





SOUND/STAGE


A quarterly live recording series at El Cid, cARTel revives the lost art of the radio play in a swanky cocktail setting. Sustainable storytelling infused with old Hollywood glamour, the LAist hailed Sound/Stage for ""...resurrect[ing] all of the allure and sultry romanticism of Old Hollywood."" 





LIVING ROOM TOUR


The Living Room Tour is a touring theatre series that commissions original work and thrusts it straight into your living room. Since 2007, LRT has hit up living rooms from Hollywood to Orange County to the Valley to Monrovia and everywhere in between. The 2013 show will tour in October as the first Halloweenthemed edition of LRT.





EVERYBODY NOSE 


cARTelâ€™s performance clown troupe creates highly collaborative theater pieces through fullydimensional, silent clowns. Using both physical comedy and intense character work through an organic realization process, we have trained over 1000 clowns to date. Additional support will ensure free workshops for people of all ages, as well as create a new holiday work for December 2013. 





We have set a fundraising goal of $200,000 for this calendar year to help us sustain our growing organization which will provide for fulltime staff, parttime and freelance coordinators and as a means to sustain our standard of artistic excellence.","Our greatest achievements have grown out of the people and artists with whom we are privileged to work.  Our ensemble of dedicated artists has grown over the years into a dedicated, wellrounded staff.  In addition to our core team, we have worked with and showcased over 2000 artists over the past five years  in successful productions and events that span several mediums of art including film, theatre, music, art and more.





While operating with very little money, weâ€™ve been creative and efficient with our resources, so perhaps our biggest achievement has been the fact that weâ€™ve kept it all going!  We have been fortunate to be able to do a lot with very little, never stopping, never settling and constantly taking on new challenges with vigor.  For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals  which today stand as our most farreaching and wellattended events  started very small.  Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (weâ€™ve literally had to shut down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything).  No Budget began in a 50person theater with no curating process and 16 videos submitted by friends and fans; it now is in its fourth year and has a red carpet, panel discussions led by arts professionals, a soldout 300person theater and has been a launchpad for young artists to create work and launch meaningful relationships within the film industry.  The winners of the very first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as â€œbandsâ€ to watch and have developed large local followings.  The growth is so exciting to watch and defines what success means to us.","We are supported by an advisory board of arts professionals, including producers Brian Udovich, Nick Scaramuzzo, Joe and Lisa LaMattina, filmmaker/programmer Terrie Samundra and marketing specialist Marcella Misserian. Our administrative and artistic ensembles are made up of dozens of young Angeleno artists. We are also currently reaching out to City Councilmembers, as our next goal is to leave a LASTING impact on the city through public works projects that can make LA a better place. We are not a company that wants to go into a theater to create theater; we want to take over a dump and better it and create theater in it. We want to form partnerships with small businesses to collaborate and spread the word about them through our art.","Our biggest metric of success is our fundraising goal of $200,000.  If we reach this, it means our audiences were bigger and that our events received more recognition than in 2012.  Larger audience means our projects were more accessible.  Starting with the expansion of Brokechella in April 2013, it means more artisttoaudiencetoartist engagement. 





Success will also be measured by how many arts administrators we can afford paying an appropriate wage to.  Right now, our administrative core is made up of 11 dedicated individuals who give up their time whenever they can because they are passionate and believe in the mission.  Though they receive paid stipends, it is simply not enough to be able to fully focus on the tasks at hand.  With support, we would be able to expand each of our programs and devote even more time to the creation and production process. 





At the end of the year, we will ask collaborators about their experience and how we can improve.  cARTelâ€™s focus is on investing in young artists, and working with them to create art, events, experiences and an overall culture that is sustainable and longlasting.  When you go to one of our events, you see both artists that have been with us since the beginning, and ones who responded to our call to submissions just weeks before.  This is because we are more interested in a strong, sturdy foundation that we can build over the course of five to ten years.  A survey will enable us to see if we are on the right track.





In addition, success will be measured by how well we establish working relationships with other arts organizations, partners that might normally be viewed as competition.  We will evaluate our collaborations to see how they benefit the arts scene of Los Angeles and the city as a whole.","With support from grants like this, we will be able to expand each of our programs to become yearlong projects that last beyond the day of the event with dedicated staffs to each.  We can create new hubs for lovers of film, music, theatre and art to experiment without worrying about the bottom line.  We can be the premiere place where experimentation and collaboration is key, which is wildly important in a city where art can sometimes get lost in the Hollywood hustle.  For example, we would love to add an extension to our No Budget Film Festival program by creating a monthly called â€œFirst Cutâ€ where artists can show the first cut of their new film to a group of smart and creative individuals who can provide feedback.  For Brokechella, we could create industry showcases for the artists weâ€™ve worked with in the past to ensure they are getting the attention they deserve. In this way, we can ensure that all of the artists that come through our doors can receive help and constructive attention AFTER the day of the event.





If the arts are our passion, then Los Angeles is indeed our canvas.  With an aging population, we believe that it is absolutely crucial to continue creating opportunities for younger, emerging artists  and not just to continue at our current rate, but to increase and expand opportunities across the board.  Los Angeles is already a destination for so many young arts professionals, but we believe that our organization can be part of the effort to elevate L.A. as a true artistic community  taking the â€œcoolâ€ factor of our local arts scene and making it possible for young artists to truly envision and experience a sustainable career in our city.





We want to be able to sustain our cityâ€™s thriving arts and culture scene  and to create opportunities that cut across existing social and economic divides.  All of our projects support emerging artists who are trying to make a name for themselves, and we make our events as affordable and accessible as possible, so that young people interested in being part of our community will be able to do so.  Los Angeles is an arts town, and a destination  but too often it feels as if there is too much of a gap between the young and the established, and that many of the opportunities that exist here do not exist for everyone.  cARTel is dedicated to giving people those opportunities.  If people come to us with ideas, we listen.  If people come to us wanting to help out or participate, we find a place for them.  Our focus is truly on the collaborative and communal potential of art, and we feel that this philosophy can absolutely benefit the sometimesfragmented communities of 21st century Los Angeles.","Success in 2050 is a thriving, durable, democratic Los Angeles arts & culture scene that is truly collaborative and provides opportunities for all types of emerging artists who want to build careers and lives in our city.  cARTel wants to show artists that contrary to popular belief, there IS A WAY to make a career out of artmaking and passionate collaboration! The creation of art is not limited by venue, by galleries, theatres, and stages. The foundation that cARTel and our partners set in 2013 will encourage emerging artists to be innovative, to collaborate rather than silo themselves away. 





To put it in a â€œbig dreamâ€ sort of way: We want to make Los Angeles VISIBLY better.  We want you to be able to pass by our project on your way to work, and to be able to participate in one of our events without having to look too hard to find us.  We want artmaking as a way of life to become a possibility for more and more people, and we believe that cARTel is the right vehicle to make that happen.





Many of us in cARTel are not native Angelenos, but we all were drawn to this city by the enduring promise that this is a place where a young person can come to make his or her dreams come true.  We are reminded of a scenic overlook on Mulholland Drive, high above the city, looking east toward downtown Los Angeles, and a placard referring to L.A. as â€œThe City That Dreams Built.â€   As Los Angeles moves through the 21st century, we face many challenges as a city and an arts community.  But this ageold promise  the â€œCity of Dreamsâ€  remains. Thousands of people will flock here in 2050 because of that promise. Their art wonâ€™t be held back by lack of funds or sponsorship. They will have developed the tools to go out there and make art no matter how little resources they think they have. "
3102035,2013035,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/DancescapeLA.html,Dancescape Ed,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"My idea is for a program that simultaneously creates performance opportunities for emerging artists, additional jobs for dance professionals, and provides art and music education programs to schools in Los Angeles.





For the past nine years, I have been developing this program.  Now in its 15th production, the annual Dancescape show is a benefit dance performance that donates all of its profits to art and music programs in Los Angeles public schools.  It regularly features between 150 and 200 performers at the student, pre-professional, and professional levels, representing various styles of dance ranging from ballet, contemporary and modern to Bollywood, hip-hop, and breakdancing, and everything in between.





As Dancescape has grown over the years, we have been able to increase the number of participants in the yearly showcase, which has lead to an increase in the amount of funds raised, which in turn has lead to a greater amount of programs sponsored and students reached.  Now that we are officially an incorporated and registered non-profit organization, we will be initiating our own education program in which our roster of professional choreographers and dance teachers will be hired to teach dance in schools around Los Angeles.  Ultimately, the program will be timed so that the students participating in a Dancescape Ed program will be able to attend the Dancescape performance with their families, friends, and teachers â€“ and possibly take the stage to perform.





My program will greatly impact the arts and cultural indicator of Los Angeles by bringing numerous organizations together to solve city-wide challenges in a unique and sustainable way.  The program is designed to cover much of its costs organically, so that as the program grows, so do the funds that are generated to keep the program growing.  At the same time, Dancescape is supplementing diminishing arts education budgets in schools. These  programs are often the first to be cut, further limiting childrenâ€™s access to what is already perceived as an expensive pursuit.  Dance, in particular, can be a very cost prohibitive activity considering lesson costs, dancewear, and required shoes.  By providing dance lessons in LA classrooms or during after school programs located on campus, we not only remove the economic barriers, but also the need for parents to drive students to a different location.  





Dancescape also creates a nurturing creative environment for arts professionals across Southern California.  Emerging artists are given the opportunity to exhibit their work in a professional environment, to gain credentials and footage, and interact with an active network of their peers.  The structure of both the performance and the intended educational program helps to make classical, contemporary, modern and urban dance accessible to different demographics.   It is not designed to compete with existing arts programs, but rather to bring them together for one cohesive celebration of the impact of dance on the human spirit.





","We have grown Dancescape into a well-known and respected event that our previous participants looked forward to every year.  Our show now regularly features more than upwards of 175 performers representing a wide variety of dance companies, studios, individual choreographers, and even school programs.  





The performance opportunities provided by Dancescape have helped emerging artists to gain representation, exposure, and experience as well as network with leading professionals in the industry. Numerous dancers have gotten jobs, joined companies, or been asked to dance in new works or projects as a direct result of Dancescape.





The students who participate - whether from private dance studios or those who participate in school programs - are given the chance to watch professional dancers in an intimate setting, to perform in a state of the art facility outside of their usual environment, and interact with other students their age from different programs who specialize in styles of dance that are different from their own.  They gain perspective on the role arts can play in the world at large, beyond the walls of the classroom, while simultaneously developing the discipline, responsibility, and self-esteem that comes with participating in a performance related activity.





In 2007, we began working with DonorsChoose.org to identify the local arts and music education programs we wished to support.  Since then, we have fully or partially funded 39 classroom proposals, mostly in high needs, high poverty schools.  These programs have reached more than 6,000 students in Southern California.








In 2011, we officially incorporated, and were also awarded tax-exempt status.








This year, we are preparing for our 15th Dancescape production.  The show will be moved to Club Nokia, downtown in the LA Live complex, and will be hosted by the most recent winner of â€œSo You Think You Can Dance,â€ Chehon Wespi-Tschopp.  We have the support of renowned choreographer Denise Leitner, the Bloc Dance Agency and numerous other dance studios and choreographers throughout Los Angeles.  This will be our first Gala Event, and we could not be more excited for it!





In 2013, we are taking our first steps toward a full fledged â€œDancescape Edâ€ program.  We are working with La Leadership Academy (LALA)  to provide a one week of dance instruction to two different age groups during summer school.  Dancescape will identify the dance instructor, cover the costs of all necessary background checks and clearance procedures, and also pay the salaries of both the dance instructor and the LALA staff member who will assist with the program.  The curriculum will be developed together with the LALA faculty to determine what will be best suited to the students in attendance.  We will be conducting careful evaluation of the studentâ€™s performance and participation during the program, and also solicit feedback from the LALA administration so that we can implement any necessary changes or improvements bef","We have been very lucky in working with some incredible partners over the years.  On the dance event side, we have had continuous support from the Bloc Agency, one of best agencies for dancers and choreographers in the industry.  Dancersâ€™ Alliance, one of the biggest dancer organizations in both New York and Los Angeles, is also a close friend of Dancescape, as is the Dance Resource Center and numerous individual dance companies and dance studios.





On the education side, we have excellent relationships with program leaders at the Gabriela Charter School, Everybody Dance!, and STAR Education who are all helping to inform our classroom program efforts.","Success will be measured in two ways.  The first is based on the Dancescape performance initiative.  Our goal is to create a quality, professional level dance production that represents the Southern California dance community.  It should include top-level talent and a wide variety of dance styles, and should be a positive, rewarding experience for performers and audience alike.  We want to ensure that tickets are fairly priced so that the show is accessible to anyone who wishes to attend, and by providing a range of seating options, will generate enough revenue through ticket sales to cover event costs and raise funds for additional programming costs in 2013.





The second area of measure will be the successful implementation of our education initiative.  The amount of kids that participate in the program, what they learned and retained as far as dance curriculum, the impact on other school subjects (i.e. improved performance), the impact on social skills and self-esteem,  positive feedback from students, teachers and administrators of the school, and staying within the allotted budget are all important baseline data.  Then, we will use that information to build proposals to replicate the program during the school year, and / or in other schools, and then fundraise as necessary to meet those replication goals.





The success of each individual program is important for this year, but the longevity and growth of the program up to and beyond 2050 is equally important!","My project will benefit Los Angeles through:





1.     INCREASED ACCESS TO ARTS EDUCATION. As increased emphasis is placed on standardized testing, in many schools there is little room left for an arts curriculum.  Furthermore, arts and music education budgets are often the first to be cut, despite the proven impact these programs have. Educatoors working in this space have defined dance as contributing to the development of a positive self concept,  and a high self concept has a positive relationship with high academic standards. Studies have shown that  students who engage with dance education are more likely to be well versed in critical and creative thinking, as dance asks students to problem solve, to think, to question, and to present material in an original way.  The physicality of dance classes give students the chance to experience something other than pencil and paper,  and is a progressive environment which allows students to make mistakes, but get better.  


The performance aspect of the program helps to instill discipline, commitment, improve team building skills, and build self-confidence.  It also helps to produce more involved parents and teachers,  which helps support a more successful overall school environment.


2.     INCREASED ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO THE PERFORMING ARTS. The Dancescape showcase is an all ages event, and often features student performers.  We ensure that ticket prices are affordable for parents, friends, and other family members who want to come and enjoy the show. People have the opportunity to watch more than 150 different performers take the stage in tap, ballet, jazz, modern, contemporary, Bollywood, and numerous other types of dance pieces; many audience members experiences some dance styles for the first time at our events.  Many of our performers are industry leaders in their fields, whether it be touring with popstars like Justin Timberlake, or principal ballerinas from the Cuban National Ballet. We select venues with an intimate feel, so that the nuances of the performances can be experienced by all in attendance.  We also ensure a fun but comfortable night club setting, so that no patron feels out of place.


The educational component of our program plays a huge role in increasing exposure to the performing arts by giving students the opportunity to participate in dance that they may not have had otherwise.


3.     COMMUNITY BUILDING.  Because we draw from the entire dance community for our performances, people from all over Southern California come together at our events.  Also, because we include students from a wide variety of both scholastic programs and private dance studios, the younger performers get the opportunity to meet and perform alongside groups from completely different geographic, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds than their own","If my program were successful, in 2050 every child would have access to quality arts education programs in his or her school.  Dance lessons would no longer be limited to only those students with the financial means or access to the few charter schools that offered such programs.  School administrators would no longer have to choose between cutting music and math, because my organization - or one of our partners - will have provided them with the funds and personnel to carry out a proven music education program.  By 2050, we will have had 37 years to learn, to revise,  to expand, and will have had over three decades of both students and teachers who have been involved in our program, and are ready to see it succeed.  We will have a nurturing, cohesive network of dance and arts professionals throughout Los Angeles county working together with multiple school districts, building not only community, but a lifelong love and appreciation for the arts in many of their students.  With more children participating in arts affordable arts related events and programs, Los Angeles will boast not only a greatly increased access to arts, but will also foster greater public support for them."
3102036,2013036,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/kidshelpingkids.html,Children Mending Hearts: Kids Helping Kids, Social Connectedness,"PROJECT BACKGROUND


<p>Children Mending Hearts (CMH) is a Los Angeles nonprofit dedicated to empowering local disadvantaged youth by giving them a chance to help other children. If local youth are provided with opportunities to help other children in need today, they learn how to be more involved, empathetic citizens.  The youth participating in our project this year will be active adults in 2050  they'll be Los Angeles' workforce, parents and policymakers. We want to help them grow up with a deeply rooted sense that Social Connectedness  volunteerism, empathy and positive social activism  is as fundamental a part of their lives as brushing their teeth or going to school each day. That's where our Global Arts After School Project comes in.</p>


<p>The CMH Global Arts After School Program teaches youth ages 914 about the importance of volunteerism, empathy and being a responsible Global Citizen. Our program helps local youth living in troubled neighborhoods discover that millions of children around the globe are living with even more extreme challenges of poverty, political violence and natural disaster  and that they, as Global Citizens, have the power to reach out and help those children in crisis. Our message: making a positive difference doesn't require a big income or advanced education. It just takes caring, respect for other people's feelings and a willingness to reach out and help.</p>


<p>Here's how the Global Arts After School Program works: CMH partners with local organizations that serve disadvantaged youth. We provide a free, 10week after school program for students, complete with curriculum, instruction and supplies. Every class cycle enrolls 25 students, with programs running concurrently at multiple sites. Every after school session features three components: 


  A CULTURAL LEARNING component teaches students about what life is like for youth living in a country currently suffering from extreme poverty, political violence and/or natural disaster;


  Our SOCIAL SKILLS component presents opportunities to learn and practice skills such as empathy, positive communication, respect for cultural differences and appropriate ways to offer help;


  HANDSON ARTS ACTIVITIES reinforce previous lesson concepts with projects that directly tie to social and cultural ideas presented in class.</p>


<p>Each program cycle culminates with an international exchange of artwork and written messages between the Global Arts After School students and youth living in the country they have studied. Working with CMH, after school students also help to send supplies and resources so that international youth may also engage in the same project as their Los Angeles counterparts.</p> 


PROJECT NEED


<p>In the last two years, CMH has received many requests from community youth organizations to expand our After School programming to:


  Include more sites;


  Increase enrollment;


  Expand our curriculum to include current events;


  Provide opportunities for students to remain involved throughout high school.</p> 


<p>Many of these requests are due to the fact that we are the only After School program in L.A. focused on teaching a combination of global citizenship, volunteerism and empathy skills. Local leaders recognize the importance of these issues, given high levels of youth violence, drug use and bullying in school and community settings. CMH also has clear positive outcomes for students per evaluation measures administered as part of the program.</p> 





<p>PROJECT GOAL: Improve Social Connectedness in Los Angeles, by increasing the number of local youth ages 918 enrolled in Children Mending Hearts programs that teach volunteerism, civic engagement and empathy.</p> 





SUPPORTING OBJECTIVES:


<p>1. Expand our Global Arts After School program to 4 new public school sites by September, 2013 for a total of 7 sites in Los Angeles;


2. Increase middle school enrollment in the program by 120%, serving a total of 620 students in 2013;


3. Integrate study of current events into our curriculum and create two new arts tracks for the program, enabling students to sustain their participation beyond the initial 10week session. Each ""continuing"" curriculum will be comprised of 10 lesson plans and accompanying teaching resources;


4. Hire a parttime (.2FTE) Outreach Coordinator to oversee development of CMH activities for high school students and online student outreach resources;


5. Recruit 16 high school students from at least 10 different high schools throughout Los Angeles to serve on a CMH Teen Advisory Council and begin developing programming for youth ages 1418.</p> 





<p>These objectives will be carried out via our established partnerships with  Los Angeles community organizations including Boys & Girls Clubs, After School All Stars, CoachArt and others. Given our current level of outreach and established program infrastructure, we are confident of reaching our stated objectives by December, 2013.</p> 


","Since its inception in 2009, Children Mending Hearts has helped over 12,000 disadvantaged youth become involved in practicing Global Citizenship and positive social activism.  The thing weâ€™re most proud of is helping children of ALL cultural, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds learn that they have the power to make a positive difference in another childâ€™s life.  After participating in our community outreach events or after school programming, we have seen countless children â€“ most of whom are themselves challenged by poverty, community violence and limited educational opportunities â€“ gain a sense of empowerment as they discover that they have an innate capacity to make life better for someone else.  As their sense of pride and selfesteem grows, they become eager to reach out and help in their communities.


Some of Children Mending Heartsâ€™ additional achievements include:


	Providing free, sustained after school programming for hundreds of youth living in Los Angeles neighborhoods challenged by drugs, gang violence and poverty;


	Developing a CMH blog that educates thousands of Los Angeles parents and youth about volunteerism, Global Citizenship and positive social activism;


	Sponsoring outreach trips to Haiti, Darfur and Democratic Republic of Congo, where we provided thousands of children living in crisis with arts and educational workshops, in addition to providing them with basic necessities such as shoes and school supplies;


	Holding largescale public childrenâ€™s events in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York, where hundreds of children learned about the importance of volunteerism and Global Citizenship and participated in projects to help their local communities;


	Successfully developing and implementing our Global Arts After School program, including publishing a formal curriculum that teaches middle schoolaged youth the importance of acting with empathy and helping people in their own communities as well as the world at large.


","Our community partners include: Boys & Girls Clubs of Los Angeles, After School All Stars, and CoachArt.","<p>Our goal is to teach L. A. youth about the importance of social connectedness & give them concrete skills for civic engagement & volunteerism they can use as adults. Based on that goal, our evaluation measures include:</p>


<p>#1:  Measuring Program Participation: We will enroll at least 620 youth annually in our Global Arts After School Program. 


Evaluation Method: We will use three quantitative measures to meet projected benchmarks:  


â€¢ Enrollment statistics will be kept at each program site, to track total enrollment & compare sitebysite participation;


â€¢ Attendance records will be kept for each After School Program cycle, to accurately measure how consistently students attend the program & what percentage complete the entire program;


â€¢ Percentage increase in community partnerships will be tracked, to help us meet benchmarks for our goal of increasing partnerships by 50% in 2013. <p></p>#2: Measuring increases in studentsâ€™ knowledge & engagement.  Our objectives are to increase studentsâ€™ knowledge of empathy, positive social skills, volunteerism and global citizenship. We also want to make sure that they have ongoing chances to actively practice what they learned. Lastly, we want students to develop positive feelings about themselves and their communities when they help other people and promote social welfare.</p><p>Evaluation Method: We will use both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess studentsâ€™ learning and engagement:


â€¢ We will administer pre and postparticipation surveys to students, to assess how their knowledge and attitudes are influenced by project participation.  The surveys are a twopart measure that a.) scores responses to questions about program content regarding empathy skills, positive social skills and global citizenship and b.) provides a Likert Scalebased survey of studentsâ€™ attitudes about the importance of volunteering, helping people in need and whether their own feelings of selfesteem are influenced by helping others;


â€¢ We will conduct three appreciative inquiry sessions to gain qualitative feedback from our partner organizations about program strengths/weaknesses, logistical considerations, what the most valuable benefits were to students and ways to enhance future outcomes.<p>Along with encouraging social connectedness, we want our project to increase public safety for youth living in highrisk neighborhoods, and provide them with strong arts learning experiences to fill the increasing gap in public schoolsâ€™ arts education programs. Our measures of student attendance will inform us about numbers of youth we are able to provide with free, safe and structured activities as an alternative to unsupervised activities on the street.  And since we are using the arts as a platform for getting students interested and involved in our programming, we will also use an observational checklist form created by the NEAâ€™s Arts Education Division to measure student engagement in the arts learning process.</p>","If we want to see longterm, sustained improvements in Los Angelesâ€™ Social Connectedness, then we need to connect with Los Angeles youth at a formative age, so that volunteerism, empathy and community engagement become a routine and expected part of their lives.  Hereâ€™s how our project will benefit Los Angeles and its citizens:


Over the next five years, our project will:


  Enroll at least 3,100 local youth in a sustained, handson educational program  that teaches volunteerism, civic engagement, empathy skills and Global Citizenship;


  Provide those students with meaningful, handson volunteer projects that encourage them to keep up to date on current events, â€œpracticeâ€ their social activism skills and gain confidence in their ability to effect positive change in their communities;


  Offer safe and supportive after school environments in neighborhoods currently challenged by drugs and gang violence;


  Use our social media, marketing and outreach resources to continue promoting the importance of teaching L.A. youth about Global Citizenship and community engagement;


  Teach cultural appreciation and racial tolerance by integrating many of Los Angelesâ€™ rich, multicultural artistic and cultural traditions into our after school curriculum;


  Use our public outreach events and High School Advisory Council to bring together youth from diverse neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, affording them opportunities to work together on youthbased charitable and humanitarian issues.





Our projectâ€™s impact on LA 2050 indicators includes:


Social Connectedness â€“ Our project directly teaches Social Connectedness (volunteerism, civic engagement, positive social skills and empathy skills) to youth at a formative point in their development. By reaching our goal of enrolling 620 youth annually in our Global Arts After School, we will educate as many as 22,200 students by 2050, helping them develop and solidify their identities as voters, community activists and Global Citizens; 





Education â€“ Participating youth will receive quality, indepth instruction in Global Citizenship, current events and fine arts â€“ subjects only minimally covered in many public school classrooms; 





Public Safety â€“ 90% of our programs sites are in neighborhoods where gang activities and youth violence are problematic.  Over 550 youth each year will benefit from the safe, structured, offthestreets programming we provide free of charge. 





Arts & Multiculturalism â€“ Through the Global Arts After School Project, two of Los Angelesâ€™ strongest assets â€“ the arts and a richly multicultural population â€“ will be used as powerful teaching tools for building positive social change in local youth. 


","<p>Children Mending Heartsâ€™ philosophy is that if we teach young people how to have generosity of spirit â€“ how to genuinely care about and help fellow human beings  they will benefit from a sense of selfworth and personal empowerment for the rest of their lives. Hereâ€™s what success looks like to us in terms of Social Connectedness in 2050: 


First, we envision a public education system where all youth receive instruction in civic engagement, global citizenship and even basic emotional literacy along with their core academic classes.  Weâ€™d like to see classrooms where the three â€œEâ€s â€“ empathy, encouragement & empowerment â€“ are taught alongside the traditional three â€œRâ€s. Those educational efforts would include supervised, handson volunteer projects at every grade level and extracurricular â€œvolunteer teamsâ€ at every middle school & high school that are given the same status & recognition as athletic and academic teams.</p>


<p>Secondly, we see a Los Angeles comprised of people who arenâ€™t just Los Angelenos, but Global Citizens.  Globalization is a fastdeveloping reality & Los Angeles is becoming a microcosm of the world at large, in terms of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as huge socioeconomic disparities. By 2050, we imagine a city of Global Citizens who see beyond those divides when it comes to basic selfworth & are committed to the idea that all people  around the world and at home â€“ are neighbors who deserve selfdignity, respect, safety and health.</p>


<pThird, because L.A.â€™s citizens will have grown up learning about & practicing civic engagement and global citizenship, they will feel empowered to vote, regardless of their educational or economic attainments.  If we can double voting rates â€“ from todayâ€™s 36% up to 72% by 2050, then weâ€™re confident that the outcome will be more public policy aimed at social good for everyone.</p>


<p>Lastly, we assume that electronic media will continue to play a huge role in shaping Los Angelesâ€™ perceptions and priorities. A recent study by the Pew Research Center* found that American children now spend an average of 7 Â½ hours a day using electronic media such as computers, & iPods. Media can either help or hinder social connectedness â€“ research has proven that positive electronic media use can promote prosocial behaviors such as altruism, cooperation and tolerance. Yet unsupervised media use amongst children fuels social isolation. Children Mending Hearts has a vision of Social Connectedness that includes all citizens â€“ but particularly youth â€“ living with a healthy balance of real human connectedness & an abundance of positive electronic media use that inspires social good.  We believe thatâ€™s attainable. After all, if you care enough to sit down at your computer, take the time to read over the amazing possibilities presented on the LA 2050 website & vote with your heart, then we can help your fellow Los Angelenos do the same.</p>

3102037,2013037,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/belong.html,BelongLA â€“ Engaging Angelenos to connect share and transform their neighborhoods and lives, Social Connectedness,"<p>How do you belong?  Belonging is the deepest sense of being socially connected and research shows that belonging can lead to Community WellBeing.  We are sparking a community movement to belong and much more.  Through the collective effort of organizations and people working together, we will change the destiny for all children, families and their neighborhoods, particularly the most vulnerable ones.  We are creating a â€œBelongâ€ model/framework that can be replicated by other diverse neighborhoods in Los Angeles and beyond using their unique assets!</p>


<p>What if all of us belong and we work to create communities where we would want to belong?  We want to belong to neighborhoods where kids are healthy and educationally successful.  We want to belong to neighborhoods where parents can be nurturing parents and economically secure and where the institutions/organizations in a community work to nurture success and belongingness. </p>


<p>Could this concept of Belong become a Community Movement? Could this happen by strengthening oneâ€™s ties to their neighbors? Could we nurture this by supporting a cadre of volunteer community ambassadors?  These ambassadors will be champions for belonging, champions for kids and families to succeed.  Ambassadors will connect people to people, to community groups, to important information, and to critical resources.  What if a community ambassador on every block eventually grew into EVERYONE on the block feeling like they belong and contributing to the health and well being of everyone who lives near them?  And, what if the organizations and institutions in a community learn how to nurture this?</p>


<p>We are starting this movement in 500 blocks in metropolitan Los Angeles where children and parents are struggling to overcome the many challenges of isolation and generational poverty.  We are engaging a diverse network of over 75 organizations of all types to create a community where people want to belong.  These public and private partners have a shared vision that the 35,000 children living in the neighborhoods within a 500 block catchment area will break all records of success in their education, health, and the quality of nurturing care and economic stability they receive from their families and community.  Our ultimate dream is to not only transform these 500 blocks, but to also develop a scalable and replicable framework that other communities can use to achieve a population level change.</p>


<p>The Belong movement has started with 25 Community Ambassadors who are volunteering their time to increase and improve social connections in their neighborhoods.  We are training the ambassadors, and our organizational partners, to incorporate and promote the protective factors in their efforts.  Protective Factors such as social connections, concrete support in times of need, and personal resilience have been shown to lead to stronger families and communities.  </p>


<p>With an LA2050 grant, our Belong movement plans to recruit a Community Ambassador for every block in the catchment area.   We will employ 3 Initiative Representatives and a Belong Campaign Manager to increase social connections leading to an overall improvement in community wellbeing. The representatives will engage community groups, recruit and support Community Ambassadors, and facilitate a series of weekly discussion sessions offered in multiple settings throughout the 500 blocks with the goal of helping residents create new social connections, increase ties to neighbors, and encourage neighbors to actively participate in community events.  All Community Ambassadors will be trained so that they too can lead the series of discussions to expand our reach and impact.</p>


<p>We will also employ social media tools on the ground level to advance the movement. Childrenâ€™s Bureau will partner with Wondros, an internationally recognized communications and social media agency, to create a 5 minute YouTube video and mobile app that will inspire the community residents, community organizations and local businesses to Belong. The mobile app will be used to help the 75 partner organizations involved in the initiative assist families, parents and adults in identifying and connecting with local community groups and with locating critical resources in the community.</p>


<p>The Belong movement and resulting campaign will strengthen social connections and promote civic engagement by increasing community belonging, ownership of and access to information about their community, and mobilizing neighbors to support one another.</p>","<p>For over 100 years, Childrenâ€™s Bureau has been a leader and innovator of child abuse treatment and prevention in Southern California. With a focus on young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care in the nation. Childrenâ€™s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980â€™s we transitioned from focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping children safe from harm.  Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation.  The California Department of Social Servicesâ€™ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Childrenâ€™s Bureau a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team which acts as a training model for other organizations.  Childrenâ€™s Bureau continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives. We are one of a small group of agencies in Los Angeles County nationally accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children, Inc. </p>





<p>Our NuParent program received international recognition in Spring 2012 with an invitation to present the program, measurement tools and results at the 8th Annual British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. </p>





<p>In 2008, we successfully completed a $22 million capital campaign and opened our new headquarters in one of the poorest, most densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles. From this center we launched the Magnolia Community Initiative  a groundbreaking model for large scale community mobilization where children, especially those under age 5 living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education and health milestones and in the nurturing they receive.  </p>





<p>Our Magnolia Community Initiative has rapidly gained the attention and recognition of national leaders, policymakers and funders including members of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, The Tides Foundation, United Way Worldwide, Gates Foundation and East LA Initiative.  Through our work with the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, we have collected and mapped the school readiness of young children in a 500 block area of Los Angeles.  We are using this mapping data to help local communities map their needs and service gaps on a highly localized basis and engaging the community to improve these outcomes.</p>





<p>With an operating budget of $30 million and actively involved boards of directors and trustees, Childrenâ€™s Bureau has the demonstrated depth of capacity, experience, relationships, and leadership to effect a communitywide transformation in Los Angeles.</p>","Childrenâ€™s Bureau has engaged 75 public and private partner organizations as well as individual community members who all have a shared vision for the transformation of this community through a collaborative alliance. Each of our diverse partners brings their own area of expertise to help shape the shared holistic outcome of strengthening communities. In particular, we will work closely with Childrenâ€™s Nature Institute, LIFTLos Angeles, and UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and communities.  Together we will promote the Belong Campaign and work to address four pillars that are key to healthy neighborhoods: health, school readiness, nurturing parenting, and economic stability.  ","<p>The Magnolia Community Initiative currently measures progress and success through a measurement strategy that captures outcomes at the neighborhood, family and child levels. This is already established and involves capturing data on neighborhood and family conditions on a quarterly, annual and biannual basis. As part of the measurement strategy, the Initiative conducted resident surveys in 2009 and 2011. These Community Belonging Survey results show significant need for improvement in social connectedness and social support. For example, in 2011, 66% of residents had at least one neighbor with whom they could discuss a personal problem, 31% of residents know their neighbors and feel as if they care about the neighborhood; and 24% of residents participate in neighborhood activities. We are capturing data on social connections, ties to neighbors, perceptions of community, community belonging and civic participation.</p>


<p>Data is also displayed on a community dashboard that informs community residents and organizational staff what children and families are experiencing â€“ in their neighborhoods and in their interactions with service systems. This is accompanied with ongoing support with problem solving and learning about how to improve or what we call â€œmove the dotâ€. </p>


<p>We will be administering the Community Belonging Survey again in the Fall of this year, 2013. This provides for us a community trend line for us to understand if our strategies being introduced within the Belong Campaign have contributed to a change in social connectedness at the community level.</p>","The pioneering work of Belong with its development of a neighborhood social movement will have significant benefit to Los Angeles.  Belong will bring about a holistic community transformation by galvanizing and supporting neighborhood residents to create their own community response to improving their neighborhoods/communities and contributing to safe and supportive environments for their and the neighborhoodâ€™s children.  





In a county as large as Los Angeles, it is virtually impossible for programs to keep up with service demand for individuals and families.  Many of our neighborhoods and the people who live there are at great risk of the major social ills that concern us all:  poverty, education failure, poor health, mental illness, violence, and domestic violence.  There will continue to be limited government and philanthropic resources to address these large scale problems for the foreseeable future.  And, the strategies that we do have as a society are relatively ineffective and too costly because they start too late when much of the damage has left scars in peopleâ€™s lives. The harnessing of volunteer community ambassadors who will become champions for belonging and connecting people to social groups and critical resources is the breakthrough we need.  





Belongingness is a deep level of social connections.  And, based on research, belonging leads to community wellness.  The development and implementation of such a strategy within a 500 block urban community of Los Angeles will serve as a laboratory for the development of a scalable and replicable model framework.  This model framework that will be developed with this grant funding will be usable by the diverse communities of Los Angeles and beyond who wish to replicate using their own unique assets.


","Success in 2050 for Social Connectedness would mean that residents will take pride in and have a sense of belonging to the Los Angeles community.  Neighbors will know neighbors and can rely on each other for daily support and in times of crisis or need.  They will voluntarily work together to not only identify and voice concerns, but they will know how to work together to solve community problems.  Through the process of becoming volunteer Community Ambassadors, residents will develop their leadership skills so they know how to engage local businesses, officials and other community members.   In building these connections and social bonds, levels of trust among and between these groups will grow.  They will gain a deeper understanding of the importance of investing in the early years in order to improve our childrenâ€™s educational and economic outcomes thereby making Los Angeles a place where residents and businesses will thrive.

3102038,2013038,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CicLAvia.html,CicLAvia: Get Connected LA, Social Connectedness,"<p>CicLAvia is the largest costfree and carfree event in the United States and is nothing short of a revolutionary approach to helping Angelenos get connected to LA and to one another.  During CicLAvia, the streets are â€œownedâ€ by the pedestrians and cyclists who make creative use of this temporary outdoor space in ways that promote active transportation, the arts, improve public health and protect the environment.  CicLAvia enables people who are perfect strangers, of all ethnicities, from diverse geographic points, with disparate income and educational levels, to come together and communicate with each other across every social border and boundary.<p/>  











<p>Since October 2010 there have been five CicLAvia events that have cumulatively opened up to 50 miles of streets in the heart of downtown Los Angeles and connected approximately 600,000 people.  On Sunday April 21, 2013, CicLAvia â€“ To The Sea will connect historic downtown LA with Venice Beach, mostly along Venice Boulevard.  This herculean feat transforms 15 miles of carcentric asphalt into a temporary shared public activity space.  It inspires real social connectedness amongst more than 150,000 participants through meaningful encounters with their fellow Angelenos.<p/>











<p>Inspired by CiclovÃ­a, the original weekly street closure event in BogotÃ¡, Colombia, CicLAvia aspires to become a monthly event and an integral part of a transit rich, culturally engaged, and economically thriving future LA.<p/>











<p>While it is often referred to as â€œthe bike event,â€ CicLAviaâ€™s mission and accomplishments reach far beyond the goal of increasing bicycle ridership in Los Angeles for a few hours on a given Sunday. By temporarily increasing public space and recreational opportunities for participants, CicLAvia highlights the necessity for a built environment that can permanently provide such amenities. The ease with which participants traverse the streets during CicLAvia underscores the possibility of a more pedestrian and bike friendly Southern California â€“ a multinodal region whose diverse and often isolated communities and populations desperately need the strengthened connections that CicLAvia brings. CicLAvia participants are often transformed into advocates for the development of such a sustainable region  growing aware of the possibilities for a healthier and more connected lifestyle as they easily move from one neighborhood to the next along the route.<p/>","<p>On 10/10/10, CicLAvia took place for the first time in Los Angeles and was enjoyed by an astounding number of participants: an estimated 100,000. From 10:00am to 3:00pm, 7.5 miles of roadways were temporarily closed to car traffic and open for recreational purposes. From Boyle Heights to Downtown, MacArthur Park to East Hollywood, families, pedestrians, cyclists, joggers, skateboarders, and rollerbladers rediscovered the roadways and neighborhoods that too often go unnoticed in a car.<p/>





 


<p>Since the pilot event, CicLAvia has taken place four additional times  each with successively larger audiences and continued widespread community and political support. Approximately 100,000 to 150,000 participants enjoy each CicLAvia event â€“ and hundreds of thousands more learn about it through an impressive marketing/pr and social media campaign.<p/>





 


<p>On October 9, 2011, the route expanded from 7.5 miles to 10 miles â€“ traveling north to El Pueblo de Los Angeles and south to the African American Firefighterâ€™s Museum. The most recent CicLAvia event took place on October 7, 2012 and extended the route to Chinatown and Exposition Park marking the fifth incarnation in less than two years â€“ an impressive feat in the nationâ€™s â€œcar capitalâ€.<p/>","<p>Neighborhood Councils, civic organizations, public and private schools, small and large businesses, hospitals, universities, nonprofit agencies, families, groups of friends, artists and individuals are all partners with CicLAvia in creating the â€œshared experienceâ€ unique to each event.<p/>








<p>Multiple departments in the Los Angeles City Mayorâ€™s office, members of LA City Council, DOT, LAPD, LAFD, and the Bureau of Street Services provide direct and critical services to produce each event. Currently METRO is providing strategic funding and the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition organizes over 400 volunteers for each CicLAvia.<p/>","<p>The benefits of CicLAvia are both immediate and longterm.  While the programâ€™s success is dependent on the number of individuals that take part in each event, it is also measured by the growing list of strategic partnerships that help to ensure the programâ€™s longterm sustainability and geographic reach. Ultimately, CicLAvia has the potential to be a series of rotating routes throughout the whole of Los Angeles County â€“ a program that is flawlessly integrated into the complex web of city and county governments. We envision a CicLAvia taking place on a monthly basis with each route associated with a different set of neighborhoods and their own time of the year (e.g. June is CicLAvia  Iconic Wilshire Boulevard, October is host to the ""traditional"" CicLAvia  Heart of LA route, etc.) True success will come when we accomplish this impressive feat.<p/>





 


<p>A less tangible measure of success is the shift in public perception towards Los Angeles as a walkable, bikeable and transitoriented region. With this shift in perception comes the realization that Los Angeles can be a more seamlessly interconnected place â€“ a more sustainable and livable region. The increasing demand for CicLAvia events across the county, in addition to the huge crowds that have taken part in the first five CicLAvias, is representative of this shift already in motion. Just as exciting, however, is the growing political support from across the County which is already translating into improved public policies on the topics of public health, public space, economic and community development, and pedestrian, bicycle and public transit infrastructure.<p/>








<p>One impressive indication of CicLAviaâ€™s continued success is that the Los Angeles Police Department has reported no major incidents or arrests. Participants are not only enjoying their city in a new way, but they are doing it with consideration and responsibility.<p/>","<p>Considered the most parkpoor major city in the United States, Los Angeles has a major challenge in finding space for people to share positive interactions.  For many neighborhoods â€“ particularly in L.A.â€™s communities of color â€“ public park space is scant or nonexistent. CicLAvia temporarily eases this problem and points to a solution by providing an ad hoc public space for such neighborhoods  a newfound common ground on which to congregate and enjoy this democratic, outdoor activity.<p/> <p>As with any successful public space, CicLAvia routes offer participants diverse reasons to participate. Through CicLAviaâ€™s organic growth, participants continually discover new purposes for converging along the route â€“ whether oneâ€™s objective is to bike, stroll, picnic, or peoplewatch. This temporary public space points out the historic emphasis on private space in LA while simultaneously shifting our focus to the need for more public places and positive events throughout the city where all populations can connect as a community.<p/><p>CicLAvia is a source of civic pride for the communities it traverses, the city as a whole as well as the entire region. By connecting dozens of diverse city neighborhoods, CicLAvia encourages residents to explore resources within and beyond their own insular territory.<p/><p>Longterm effects of CicLAvia not only include increased CicLAvia events throughout the year and an expansion of the program into all corners of Los Angeles County, but a shift in public perception of Los Angeles as a carcentric metropolis. With a focus on improved public health, increased public space, enhanced community and economic development and the promotion of bicycle, pedestrian and public transportation advocacy, CicLAvia advocates for strengthened public policy in each of these areas. As a result, CicLAvia helps to transform Los Angeles County into a region that is more focused on smart growth, sustainable living and community development.<p/>","<p>CicLAvia envisions a 2050 in which an expansive network of vibrant public spaces, new infrastructure and free events allow Angelenos to seamlessly connect with the cityâ€™s diverse communities and populations. The heightened sense of social connectedness created by universal access to public spaces and gatherings will yield a significant increase in civic engagement  more Angelenos will vote, volunteer and play an active role in their communities.<p/>"
3102039,2013039,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/cityearthworm.html,You Can Compost That!, Environmental Quality,"Composting extends the lifespan of existing landfills, protects water quality, prevents the release of potent greenhouse gases, and produces the best fertilizer plants have ever met.  Currently, City Earthworm is already gearing up to make composting accessible, easy, and desirable to the residents of Santa Monica by providing affordable weekly food waste pickup.  At the same time, we will complete the farmtotabletofarm circle by delivering the food waste to organic farms for composting and increase their food production.  





With the funds provided by My LA2050, we would be able to expand our service to residents, restaurants, grocers, and other commercial customers throughout Los Angeles County so that everyone would be able to compost.  





In addition, we will partner up with local schools to set up composting operations onsite.  We provide the setup, training, and a service plan to make sure the schoolâ€™s composting operation is truly functional.  Tending the composting operation is simple and can be done with coordinated efforts by the schoolâ€™s groundskeeper, cafeteria staff, and designated students.  This model is based on a system that is commonplace in the United Kingdom, in which local residents and business pay community gardens to compost their food waste.





Composting is tremendously beneficial for the environment.  The following is a short list of reasons why it should become common practice:








1) Greenhouse gas emissions from food rotting in landfills would be dramatically reduced through composting.  When food waste rots in a landfill, methane â€“ a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 21 times that of carbon dioxide â€“ is released into the atmosphere.  Considering that Americans throw away nearly 40% of their food and that food is the single largest source of waste to landfills, composting food scraps instead of simply trashing them can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  





2) Existing landfill lifespans would be increased by composting.  According to the 2006 Annual Report by Waste Management, existing landfills at that time had an average life of 28 years left.  Land is one of Earthâ€™s most precious natural resources.  Using land for building new landfills or expanding existing ones is undesirable when it could be used for more productive purposes such as food production, housing, or habitat conservation.  Even more importantly, landfilling carries significant negative environmental impacts and should be viewed as a last resort for waste disposal rather than the default path.





3) Water quality is preserved through composting.  As mentioned above, composting diverts waste from landfills, which often contaminate groundwater supplies.  Further, the use of compost in agriculture in place of synthetic fertilizers should be heavily promoted.  Synthetic fertilizer causes algal blooms and aquatic dead zones when released into local bodies of water by rain or erosion.  Naturally derived compost does not cause this harmful effect and, in fact, strengthens soil structure to reverse erosion.  Compost has also been shown to significantly improve crop yield and strengthen plantsâ€™ resistance to disease.  Furthermore, composting food waste instead of sending it to insink garbage disposals lessens the load on municipal wastewater treatment plants.





  ","City Earthworm was started with a single mission: to make composting a household activity.  We designed and built the City Bin, a modern and compact indoor composter that will allow EVERYONE to compost, regardless of the size of their living space or yard.  The City Bin will soon be in production locally in Los Angeles County and will be manufactured using recycled plastic.  





Both City Earthworm and the City Bin have been featured in blogs, newspapers, as well as in television news programs.  





City Earthworm realizes that, while it would be great to allow more people to compost at home, there will also be some people who do not want to or are unable to do so.  The easiest way to truly popularize composting is to make it easy for people.  Therefore, we started offering a food service pickup program to apartment dwellers in Santa Monica.  We now hope to expand our service to the entire Los Angeles County.


","We will be sending food waste for composting to Burkart Organics Farm and Silver Lake Farms initially.  As we expand our service and the amount of waste picked up increases, we will partner with additional farms.  Delivery and dropoff will be performed locally within Los Angeles County to minimize emissions from vehicles.","The project will have achieved its goal by diverting waste from landfills through composting.  Towards this, we will measure the weight of food waste picked up each week and sum up the total at the end of the year.  An average family of four generates about 500 pounds of food waste per year.  We hope to divert 25,000 pounds of food waste from landfills in the remaining half of 2013 (equivalent to participation from 100 households).





Additionally, we hope to develop a selfsustaining business from the injection of funds from My LA2050.  Therefore, we will also measure our success by examining the viability of the pickup business, the number of households served by our business, as well as the number of jobs created by the project.  We hope to be serving at least 100 Los Angeles households and have created two fulltime positions by the end of the year.





Finally, we aim to set up five selfsustaining composting operations at local schools by the yearâ€™s end.


","Our project would primarily benefit Los Angeles by reducing its environmental impacts.  However, it would also produce positive outcomes for several other indicators included in the My LA2050 Challenge.  Below is a list of just some of the benefits provided by our project:





	Food waste composting will significantly reduce Los Angelesâ€™ contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.  In addition, diverting food waste from landfills will help improve air quality in Los Angeles by reducing the vehicles miles traveled by waste haulers to landfills and lessening odors produced by the rotting of organic waste.





	Providing affordable weekly food scrap pickup will help Los Angeles meet the Stateâ€™s waste diversion requirement to divert at least 50% of waste from landfills after 2004.  Existing landfill lifespans in the Los Angeles area would also be increased by composting.  





	Create jobs for Angelenos as we will need individuals to perform weekly pickup services in the various neighborhoods of Los Angeles





	Setting up composting operations in our schools would allow them to reduce their waste management expenses, produce the fertilizer needed for their grounds, generate income by composting community food waste, and teach students important lessons in biology, ecology, agriculture, and sustainability.





	Both residents and businesses of Los Angeles can potentially save money by reducing the amount of trash picked up by conventional haulers to be sent to landfills.  Additionally, they will gain satisfaction from helping their local schools.





	Increase environmental awareness within Los Angeles in general, particularly with regards to food wastefulness and global climate change





	Organic farms will benefit from the incoming stream of compostable food waste provided by our service.  The compost will be used to enhance or increase crop yield, completing the farmtotabletofarm circle.","We at City Earthworm aim to make it easier for the residents and businesses of Los Angeles to lower their environmental impact.  We hope that Los Angeles will continue (but at an accelerated pace) on the path to becoming an environmentallyoriented, sustainable city.  In the year 2050, success with regards to environmental quality means that Los Angeles would have achieved and surpassed the 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels, as mandated by AB 32.  We would be a zerowaste city, instead composting, recycling, or upcycling all of our waste.  Composting would be mandatory for all organic waste.  All Los Angeles farms would be organic, and most â€“ if not all  produce and meats sold in grocery stores would be organically produced.  Compost would be available free of charge to everyone for use in their own yards.  Backyard vegetable gardens would be commonplace, and everyone would have easy access to fresh produce."
3102040,2013040,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LACreates.html,LA Creates! Media Arts Learning Initiative,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>Media arts are LAâ€™s most significant global contribution to arts and culture and the regionâ€™s leading economic driver.  In the LA2050 Report, Arts and Cultural Vitality is the only indicator out of eight found to significantly enhance quality of life, earning the Reportâ€™s highest ranking.  Yet, while noted economist Ann Markusen calls LA â€œAmericaâ€™s Artist Super City,â€ LAâ€™s young people lack the access and opportunity to enter the creative industries. This is especially true for people of color, who make up 91% of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD Fingertip Facts, 11/12).</p>


<p>â€¢	The question: How do we ensure LAâ€™s young people will develop creativity while gaining access to current & nextgeneration skills & tools? </p>


<p>â€¢	The answer: LA Creates! Media Arts Learning Initiative.


<p>Media arts are particularly motivating to todayâ€™s digitallyconnected youth.  Media arts encompass art created with new media technologies, including digital moviemaking, computer graphics, computer animation, virtual art, interactive art, video games, & computer robotics.  The core concept of LA Creates! is for students to develop technical & criticalthinking skills, integrating the arts into core subject areas, while unleashing creativity through media arts learning.</p>


<p>LA Creates! was developed by a consortium (the Consortium) headed by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) in partnership with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (the Academy); LAUSD; The LA Fund for Public Education (LA Fund); Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); & California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). We will be expanding to include UCLAâ€™s School of the Arts & Architecture; School of Theater, Film, & Television; Hammer Museum; & Film Independent.  LA Creates! will use the Reportâ€™s most positive indicator, Arts & Cultural Vitality, to address its lowest, Education.  As the Report posits, educational achievement impacts all other indicators, from Income & Employment to Housing, Health, & Social Connectedness.</p>


<p>LA Creates! consists of three components:</p>


<p>â€¢A pilot Digital Moviemaking Program will build on the work of two LAUSD middle schools, Millikan in the San Fernando Valley & Bancroft in Hollywood, which already have existing film academies.  The two primary instructors from these schools will work with the Consortium to initiate similar programs in two to three middle schools in underserved LA communities in Year II. In subsequent years of the fiveyear pilot, two or more schools will be added annually.  Working with the film industry to obtain inkind equipment donations, as well as to make some purchases, LA Creates! will equip each school with a media arts lab with the cameras & computers necessary to create films/videos.</p>


<p>For LA Creates! elective course film teachers will work with generalist teachers of core subjects at each school, integrating the media arts to teach English, math, history, & the sciences. Students will learn how to tell personal & community stories, building Social Connectedness, another LA2050 indicator, while also strengthening competency in technical skills that will better prepare them to gain Employment, the second lowest ranked indicator.</p>


<p>â€¢The Academy, known throughout the world for its OscarsÂ© ceremony, is expanding its Media Literacy Program to a new 14,000 sq. ft. facility in Hollywood that will, in Year I: (1) involve 10 local schools in afterschool programs, and (2) serve as a training center for LAUSD film and generalist teachers involved in the LAUSD Digital Moviemaking Program.</p>


<p>The Academy will involve its vast network of Academy members and industry professionals as guest teachers to inspire the students and help promote the program. The Academy will also work with the Consortium to develop a curriculum aimed at middle school students.


<p>Studios such as Sony Pictures, with which DCA has had a 10year partnership, the â€œSony Pictures Media Arts Program,â€ which teaches middle school students animation in five centers around the City, donates state of the art equipment regularly. Sony will be asked to make similar donations to LA Creates!, as will other industry leaders.


<p>â€¢Finally, the goal of LA Creates! is to be integrated into a new LAUSD fiveyear strategic plan for arts education that is currently being developed by LAUSDâ€™s Arts Education Branch with funding support from The LA Fund. After the initial fiveyear inschool pilot program is complete, if approved by LAUSD and the Board of Education, the program would be supported by LAUSD in the longterm, in coordination with the Academy's Media Literacy Program.</p>


<p>LA should have the most farreaching and thorough media arts education program in the U.S.; our mission is to create and implement a quality program that becomes an integral part of every LAUSD middle school studentâ€™s experience, inspiring students, teachers, and families.</p>","<p>DCA generates & supports high quality arts & cultural experiences for LAâ€™s 4 million residents & 26 million annual visitors.  DCA supports artists & cultural projects through the following Divisions:  The Grants Administration Division awards grants to over 270 LAbased artists & cultural organizations.  The Public Art Division funds the creation & maintenance of all public art on City property or private commercial developments.  The Community Arts Division manages 25 neighborhood arts & cultural centers (e.g., Barnsdall Art Park in Hollywood); theaters (e.g., Warner Grand Theater in San Pedro); & historic sites (e.g., the Watts Towers; Frank Lloyd Wrightâ€™s Hollyhock House).  DCAâ€™s Marketing & Development Division markets the City's arts & cultural organizations & leads DCAâ€™s development efforts with the corporate community.</p>


<p>DCA is spearheading a number of initiatives that directly address the LA2050 indicators.  In Housing, DCA is working with the Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation & Artspace, an organization dedicated to creating sustainably affordable space for artists & arts organizations, to build the Broadway Arts Center (BAC)  a mixedused facility to include approximately 100 affordable live/work units, along with rehearsal & performance space.  The BAC will be part of the Broadway Cultural Quarter, anticipated to include a downtown campus for CalArtsâ€™ MFA Theater program, creative industry incubator space, and upperfloor offices for creative businesses and startups.  </p>


<p>The Watts Our Town initiative, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, brings together community members and stakeholders to design an artistic â€œgreenâ€ pathway connecting the 103rd Street Metro Station to the Watts Towers.  Environmental Quality is promoted by replacing existing concrete walkways with grass and trees, and Social Connectedness is encouraged by repurposing a historic train station into a visitors center and gallery.</p>


<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencesâ€™ Media Literacy Program currently serves nearly 1600 high school students annually.  The program includes film screenings and group discussions, along with visits from filmmakers and industry professionals.  It is designed to help students improve analytical skills to encourage thoughtful interaction with film.  In addition, the Academy is building the worldâ€™s largest movie museum  the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures  next to the LACMA campus.  Providing students with access to this museum and to LACMA, as well as expanding to programs, will be an integral part of LA Creates!</p>


<p>The LA Fund, recently launched â€œArts Matter,â€ an unprecedented campaign to revitalize arts education in LAUSD.  Developed to drive public awareness for the critical role of arts education in public schools, the campaign includes leading contemporary artists, including Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari, as well as LA entertainment, civic, and education leaders.</p>","<p>â€¢	The City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs</p>


<p>â€¢	The Los Angeles Unified School District</p>


<p>â€¢	The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education</p>


<p>â€¢	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</p>


<p>â€¢	The California Institute of the Arts</p>


<p>â€¢	The Los Angeles County Museum of Art</p>


<p>â€¢	UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture; UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television; and the Hammer Museum</p>


<p>â€¢	Film Independent</p>


<p>â€¢	Arts for LA, the regionâ€™s arts advocacy organization, will incorporate LA Creates! into its Arts Education advocacy efforts.</p>","<p>The following metrics will be used to evaluate LA Creates!  </p>


 


<p>â€¢	Controlled Pre/Post Assessment of students will be made to understand if the LA Creates! model of projectbased film study helps students learn more effectively.  LA Creates! program efficacy will be evaluated based on a review of quantifiable data, such as attendance, test scores, and completed work assignments.</p>





<p>â€¢	Teacher, student, and parent surveys will measure interest in and satisfaction with the LA Creates! program.  Teachers will also be surveyed on the level of student engagement during the course, and students will be surveyed about skills learned.</p>





<p>â€¢	Quality reviews will include a set of â€œjudging"" rubrics to be developed by expert panels comprised of members from the film industry and education leaders in order to evaluate studentsâ€™ work for specific elements of the lesson plans.  For example, professional story board editors will be used to help ensure that if story boarding is used in a class, students are doing it at the appropriate agelevel.   If the ultimate class project is a shortfilm, each area of the work would be evaluated (i.e., editing, lighting, set design, etc.) in order to determine a benchmark for student performance and expectations.</p>





<p>At the end of the Year I of the pilot program, an initial evaluation will be conducted to determine the planâ€™s efficacy and make corrections as needed.  A final evaluation will be made at the end of the fiveyear program. </p>


 


<p>The programâ€™s ultimate success will be measured based on the ability of LA Creates! to achieve the following identified outcomes:</p>


 


<p>â€¢	Develop LAUSD's first filmbased middle school course of study that integrates core subjects with the creative process and applications of film making.</p>





<p>â€¢	Demonstrate that LA Creates!â€™ inschool programming has a strong impact on students, based on quantifiable data from the above metrics.</p>





<p>â€¢	Prove that this course of study can be successfully replicated in underserved communities throughout LA County.</p>





<p>â€¢	Develop a set of lesson plans for LA Creates! that is aligned to the Common Core State Standards, LAUSD's English Language Learners Master Plan, and a new teacher evaluation system that is currently being developed by LAUSD.  These lessons will be part of an approved LAUSD fullyear middle school course description for media arts.  In addition, individual lessons will be written to focus on arts integration throughout the school, taught in collaboration with nonarts teachers, to aid meaningful learning in all subject areas.</p>





<p>â€¢	Leverage the support of LAUSD with artists and leaders in LA's arts and culture community to advance and sustain LA Creates!</p>","Bringing LAâ€™s most recognized industry into the classroom will have immediate AND longrange effects.  The LA2050 Report states that 36% of LAUSD students do not graduate high school, adding â€œThatâ€™s up to 20,000 Angelenos entering the modern economy every year and competing without a high school degree.â€  Per LAUSD staff, this is a conservative number since it does not account for students who drop out before reaching high school.  A studentâ€™s decision to drop out of highschool is frequently the result of negative school experiences (e.g., academic failure, suspensions) that often begin before the ninth grade.  By targeting middle school students, LA Creates! is being designed to appeal to young people at an earlier stage in their education and serve as a catalyst to change this trajectory.





To capitalize on the areaâ€™s surging creative sector (one out of every eight jobs in Greater LA, per the 2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy), LA Creates! will work with Consortium and industry stakeholders to help students develop skills identified by local employers as vital to our continued leadership in the creative industries.  These skills are needed for artsrelated jobs and careers, such as animators and digital effects artists, as well as nonarts STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) careers that also value media arts training, because they require communication, collaboration, and problem solving skills, all of which are developed through media arts education.  To ensure that the arts and culture ecosystem in LA continues to significantly enhance human development while outpacing other cities in the U.S. and abroad, â€œLA must recruit, train and retain the next generation of creative artistsâ€ (LA2050 Report). 





An important aspect of LA Creates! is the development of the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in the historic Wilshire May Company building, adjacent to the LACMA campus.  This new museum will build on the Academyâ€™s vast archival resources, important ties to the film industry, and robust yearround public programming.  It will also complement LACMAâ€™s focus on the visual arts, including the arts of the moving image.  Film Independent, an organization that empowers filmmakers to tell their own stories in their own voices, currently works with LACMA on its film programs.  Film Independent is a DCA grantee for â€œProject Involve,â€ a 20year diversity program dedicated to cultivating the careers of filmmakers from communities traditionally underrepresented in the industry, and will be a natural collaborator for this project.





Moreover, LAUSD will incorporate LA Creates! into its fiveyear strategic plan for arts integration in public schools, with the final goal of creating a sustainable Media Arts program involving all 85 LAUSD middle schools and reaching the 120,000 middle school students enrolled yearly.  The Goldhirsh Foundation award would be a critical first step in launching the initial year of this ambitious pilot.","<p>According to the LA2050 Report, LAâ€™s Arts & Culture Vitality indicator will move from its current green ranking, indicating that it â€œsignificantly enhances human development,â€ to light green, indicating that it simply â€œenhances human developmentâ€ in the year 2050.  By training the next generation of artists & creative professionals, LA Creates! will ensure that LA keeps its current place as a national & international leader in the arts.</p>


<p>Of equal importance is the symbiotic relationship between the arts & other indicators.</p>


<p>Education received the lowest score in the LA2050 Report.  Yet there is a plethora of research, including that of Stanford Universityâ€™s Dr. Shirley Brice Heath, which reveals that young people who participate in the arts for at least three hours a day/three days a week, for at least one full year, are four times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement, four times more likely to participate in a math & science fairs, & three times more likely to win awards for school attendance.</p>


<p>Arts education also improves SAT scores.  Per The College Board, math SAT scores improved by 41 points, & verbal scores improved by 57 points after students were enrolled in arts education programs.  Studying the arts for four years or more improved total SAT scores by 119 points.  Through strategic investments in arts programs such as LA Creates!, increased LA student retention is possible, diminishing dropout rates & increasing college attendance.</p>


<p>In terms of employment, the latest 2012 Otis Report indicates that the creative industries are the second largest business sector in the Los Angeles region, generating nearly 1 million jobs.  Unfortunately, many of these creative jobs are out of reach for a large number of LA residents, particularly for people of color.  LA Creates! will provide linkages between young people & the entertainment industry.  Capturing the imagination of young people at an early age, while providing training & networking access to industry leaders, will develop a homegrown pool of talent, helping to ensure that in 2050, LAâ€™s creative jobs will not be outsourced, & that LA retains a high concentration of creative artist jobs. </p>


<p>It is especially significant that LA Creates! is proposing to utilize the highest ranked indicator to systematically address retention, training, & advancement issues in the lowest ranked indicator, Education.  Education, in turn, is the most significant determiner of how an individual fares in income & employment; ability to secure adequate housing in an environmentally secure community, & effects all other indicators in the Report as well. Moreover, LA Creates! will leverage the support of LAUSD with leaders in the arts & culture community to scale up & sustain the program over the long haul.  In turn, this positive linkage between Arts & Cultural Vitality & Education will result in a more vibrant & engaged community as we head into the year 2050.</p>"
3102041,2013041,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/RAP.html,Camp Educates Kids Forever , Education,"The mission of the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) is to enrich the lives of the residents of Los Angeles by providing safe, welcoming parks and recreation facilities and affordable, diverse recreation and human services activities for people of all ages to play, learn, contemplate, build community and be good stewards of our environment.





We desire to provide day camp scholarships to over 1,000 youth ages 5 â€“ 17, in the summer of 2013.  From June 10, 2013 to  August 9, 2013 over 75,000 youth will register at RAP summer camps that provide youth enrichment activities including but not limited to computer training classes, environmental awareness and education, mentoring, sports, team building, handson outdoor and camping activities, arts and crafts, aquatics, fishing, hiking, and life skills.





RAP operates American Camping Association (ACA) accredited residential camps at Griffith Park Boys Camp and Camp Hollywoodland for Girls, both situated in one of the largest parks in North America.  The majority of our summer day camps are located among our 184 recreation centers that dispersed over 457 square miles of the City of Los Angeles (City) 





Studies show all children lose ground academically during the summer, and the achievement gap is even more striking for lowincome children (Cooper 1996). Richard Rothstein, former national education columnist for The New York Times, and now a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, agrees ""disadvantaged children get less educational support in summers and after school."" His research confirms this differential ""summer setback"" occurs partly because middleclass children's learning is reinforced in the summer months â€” they read more, travel, and learn new social and emotional skills in camps and organized athletics"" (Rothstein 2005).





Day camp scholarships will help to close this gap by offering affordable Out of School Time (OST) enrichment programming to youth in Los Angeles during summer vacation months.  RAP has over 100 years of programming experience and use models of informal learning opportunities that psychologists and academia are beginning to understand.  It is no coincidence that the Latin word â€œcampusâ€ (field) reveals the link between school campuses and campsites. These two institutions not only share a common root, but together account for countless hours of engagement and influential experience for American children and adults (Ozier, 2010).  Dr. Edmund Gordon, one of the founders of the Head Start Program contends supplemental educational experiences are vital to all children and are closely associated with ""exposure to family and communitybased activities and learning experiences that occur both in and out of school"" (Gordon 2005).


","RAP has provided quality recreational services to the residents of the City for over 100 years.  This year, 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of RAP camping programs.





Annually, RAP serves several hundred thousand people including more than 1,000 youth daily in our after school programs, more than 60,000 youths in our sports leagues, and 75,000 in summer day camps.  RAP has worked cooperatively with other City entities and outside agencies on numerous foundation, state, and federally funded grant programs with budgets ranging from approximately $5,000 to more than $15 million.    





For the past five years RAP has partnered with the Mayor Villaraigosaâ€™s Summer Night Lights (SNL), an antigang program that keeps parks open after dark with organized activities for at risk youth, and provides job opportunities and a safe place to spend the summer.  By empowering communities and targeting the traditionally mostviolent summer months, SNL has become a national model for violence reduction.  Since 2008, SNL has expanded from 8 parks to 32 city parks, leading to a 57% reduction in gangrelated homicides in SNL neighborhoods. 





In 2011, RAPâ€™s One Wattâ€™s Program, a cluster of programs serving residents of the Nickerson Gardens, Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts housing developments and the 109th Street Recreation Center, became the first park program based in Los Angeles County to win the â€œGovernors' Council on Physical Fitnessâ€ gold medal since the competition was created in 2006.  The Wattâ€™s One Program was awarded for bridging communities through its innovative recreational programs that promote physical activity, fitness and wellbeing of California youth.  Hundreds of boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 12 years participated in soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and flag football programs in efforts to unite the Watts community.


","Various RAP divisions, state, federal, and nonprofit organizations collaborate to implement our summer day camp programs.  RAP partners include:  United States Department of Agriculture, State of California Department of Education, State of California Department of Justice, County of Los Angeles, National Recreation and Park Association, National Atmospheric Administration, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, California Recreation and Parks Society, American Camping Association, Montrose Settlements Restoration Program,  RAP Park Rangers, RAP Aquatics Division, Forestry Division, Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, Los Angeles Parks Foundation, and People for Parks.","The Program Director and Program Staff will conduct an internal evaluation of the program at the end of the summer to assess the effectiveness of the programs planned goals, objectives, and outcomes in order to maximize program performance.  RAP will request feedback from parents, participants, and staff to assist in evaluating the program.  A final report will be created to summarize the findings.  





Goal:  Provide 1,000 summer camp scholarships in 2013.


Objective:  RAP will use approved scholarship forms and attendance rosters to track the distribution of 1,000 scholarships for youth ages 5 â€“ 17 years attending RAP summer camps in 2013.  Scholarships will be awarded according to RAP policy and procedures until all scholarships have been awarded.





Goal:  Provide Increased Out of School Time (OST) programming for youth in the summer of 2013.


Objective:  1,000 participants who received summer camp scholarships will engage in a minimum of 30 hours of activity per week totaling 30,000 hours of OST programming. 


","This scholarship program will allow more than 1,000 youth to attend summer camp in 2013, who otherwise would not have this opportunity.  The impact will be realized throughout the City of Los Angeles, with the majority of scholarships being allocated among summer camps located at RAP recreation centers located within economically disadvantaged communities, and for youth to experience a week long overnight camp at one of our two residential camps.  The 2005 and 2006 the American Community Survey revealed that 20% of the City met the Federal guidelines for poverty, with a 29% child poverty rate.  Approximately 80% of Los Angeles Unified School District students qualify for free or reduced price meals.  With over one third of the population of the City under the age of 18 (Census 2010), affordable out of school time programs that offer informal learning opportunities to keep youth engaged in summer vacation months with the goal of minimizing the summer learning gap.  


The RAP summer day camp and residential camp programs provide a multitude of benefits by bridging social diversity within communities, providing an alternative to antisocial behavior, teaching community values and life skills, facilitating computer literacy, promoting environmental stewardship, advancing socialization skills and team building to teach conflict resolution and problem solving skills, while improving the health of youth by providing alternative physical activities and nutrition. 


","In 2050 success will mean more Los Angeles students are graduating from high school, attending and graduating college, ready to enter the workforce to benefit Los Angeles.  Public school systems will look continue work with public agencies and nonprofit organizations to improve education.





Young people are our future business and public leaders of Los Angeles. They will pay taxes, raise families, and undertake volunteer and other community service activities.  Outofschool time (OST) settings are important venues for helping youth successfully navigate their adolescent years and develop the knowledge, values, attitudes, skills, and behaviors they will need to be fully functioning adults. In particular, there is strong evidence that OST activities and contexts are significant contributors to the promotion of youth development. The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks will continue to provide these resources to support recreational opportunities, programs, and services to facilitate OST activities.  Municipal leaders already understand that OST programs are wellpositioned to help the next generation develop a comprehensive set of 21st century skills that emphasize problem solving, collaboration, use of technology, and creative thinking.

3102042,2013042,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/backyardhomes.html,Backyard Homes: Sustainable Flexible Affordable Housing for LA, Housing,"cityLAB proposes to build, study, and publicly display a prototype Backyard Home using innovative, simple technologies that will create sustainable, affordable, flexible, livable housing for Los Angeles.


<br><br>


Los Angeles developed as a city of suburbs, where yards and gardens surround individual homes to create our distinctive neighborhood identity. But LAâ€™s suburban sprawl also created a laundry list of problems, from traffic congestion to unaffordable home prices. cityLAB, a think tank at UCLA, along with Daly Genik Architects, have developed a new concept and construction technology for â€œBackyard Homesâ€ that will maintain the beauty of the Los Angeles homeinthegarden pattern, yet has the potential to provide a substantial supply of new housing. The idea is simple: on a housebyhouse basis, owners can acquire and customize a Backyard Home. It arrives to the site packed flat, allowing it to squeeze past side yards and tight spaces. Once in the backyard, a foundation is erected, the flatpacked walls expand to become rooms, and a skin is added to the walls. Homeowners can customize a studio, onebedroom, and twobedroom arrangement, much like purchasing a new car with various interior packages to choose from.


<br><br>


In fact, there are 500,000 singlefamily home sites in the City of Los Angeles alone. Already a number of those halfmillion lots have illegal rental units in their garages and backyards. In 2003, the State of California passed the Granny Flat Law, to permit second units on singlefamily lots, and in 2009, the City Council acted to make backyard housing possible across Los Angeles. Our project recognizes that the illegal units reflect a real need for backyard housing that is safe, legal, affordable, and easy to construct. The recent state and city rulings provide the guideposts to creating safe, legal units; the cityLAB prototype will create a model of affordable, easytoconstruct Backyard Homes. With the laws and the model home, everything is in place for homeowners to build Backyard Homes that will create a much more diverse housing supply and a more livable Los Angeles.","cityLAB, a research center at UCLAâ€™s School of the Arts and Architecture, was founded in 2006 by Director Dana Cuff and CoDirector Roger Sherman. Since that time it has become one of the most well respected urban think tanks in America. cityLAB was featured in Architecture Magazine, on CNN International News, in Newsweek Magazine, and in the American Pavilion of the Venice Biennale. It gained worldwide recognition and the national spotlight with its open design competition, WPA2.0Working Public Architecture, the results of which were presented to lawmakers in Washington DC and key members of President Obamaâ€™s urban advisory team. cityLABâ€™s important role in Los Angeles is increasingly evident through its frequent mention in the news, its work to revitalize Westwood Village, its studies about the ways high speed rail and transit systems can improve civic life, its role in advancing new urban policy, and its championing of good design in our region. cityLAB is successful when it explores new ideas for urban design that reach the public, studentsâ€”our next generation of urban activists, and urban leaders of all stripes.


<br><br>


Daly Genik Architects is partnering with cityLAB to design and test the Backyard Homes prototype. Daly Genik, founded in 1990, is an awardwinning design practice with a focus on craft, construction systems, and material research. The firmâ€™s work highlights the interrelationship of research and fabrication, sustainability and livability, utility and form. Firm Principal Kevin Daly has designed some of the areaâ€™s most outstanding affordable housing for the Santa Monica Community Corporation, as well as widely recognized technological innovations that serve environmental goals, such as a model daylighting system at Art Centerâ€™s Pasadena campus.","The project will be undertaken by the internationally recognized team of UCLAâ€™s cityLAB and Daly Genik Architects who have been collaborating for the past six years. Our partners have included the LA City Planning Department, Los Angeles Housing Department, nonprofit housing corporations, various departments and faculty members at UCLA, a range of community organizations, Habitat for Humanity, Stanford Universityâ€™s Engineering Department, and Buro Happold Engineers. Because cityLAB is a universitybased research center, students are involved in all the work we undertake. About 100 architecture and planning students have been part of the Backyard Homes effort to date. All collaborators have donated their services and will continue to do so.","We propose to build a demonstration prototype specifically so that we can evaluate its performance on a number of measures. This is a real research project as well as a public demonstration of new housing technologies. We will measure the success of the Backyard Homes demonstration project in the following ways:


<br><br>


1. Cost. We will evaluate the prototype in terms of cost, with the goal that it should cost less than half of prevailing persquarefoot residential construction, or approximately $50,000 for a small unit.


<br><br>


2. Environmental Impacts. The prototype will be evaluated in terms of environmental impacts on a range of measures, with the goal that it should outperform standard home construction by a factor of 10. We will study approximately two dozen different impacts such as recyclable materials, production of carcinogens, summer smog, acidification, sourcing and shipping, assembletodisassemble impacts, etc.


<br><br>


3. Ease of Construction. The assembly of the prototype will be documented to both evaluate and record how easy it is to install. The installation in the Hammer Museum courtyard will itself be part of the exhibition, allowing the public to observe, firsthand, the methods of construction and the â€œbackyard squeezeâ€ in practice.


<br><br>


4. Public Response. We will collect responses from visitors to the Backyard Home exhibition during the two to four weeks it will be installed in the museumâ€™s publicly accessible courtyard and will begin to develop relationships with potential developers and owners of Backyard Homes.","Backyard Homes will benefit Los Angeles by making it more livable in three substantial ways.





First it will improve our housing, by making it more affordable, more flexible, more sustainable, and more livable. According to a preliminary study by Stanford University engineers, compared to a typical house of the same size, the Backyard Home has a ten times to as much as a hundred times lower environmental impact. The simple construction system will make it possible to acquire a Backyard Home the way you might buy a car, will leave no foundation if and when it is disassembled, and will be adjusted or customized to each yard and household need. A family that needs more space can find it in their own backyard. A family that wants to reduce its mortgage payment can do so. A Backyard Home can provide a home office now, and become a caregiver apartment later.





Second, it will improve neighborhoods. Now, when a familyâ€™s circumstances change, they often need to move to a new community where housing is cheaper, bigger, smaller, or in some way more suitable to their new needs. This creates neighborhoods in constant flux. Neighborhoods will have greater stability when people can stay in place through the various stages of their lives. Neighborhood stability has profound benefits for the residents, from improved quality of life, to improved educational outcomes, to improved health outcomes. In addition, Backyard Homes is a solution that can replace unwanted infill housing development such as large apartment buildings or condominiums that change neighborhoods in unwanted ways.





Third, Backyard Homes will improve the city as a whole, by helping reduce sprawl, traffic, and greenhouse gas emissions. The innovative construction and design technology can set a new standard for housing in the city, demonstrating that Los Angeles can grow inward instead of outward, while at the same time growing more sustainably, more beautifully, and more affordably. In the same way that midcentury modernists championed a new form of home through technology and design in 50sera LA, Backyard Homes can make Los Angeles more Angeleno for the twentyfirst century.","In 2050, if Backyard Homes had spread to just 20% of the 500,000 single family lots across Los Angeles, we would have a full 100,000 new, affordable, sustainable homes and yet our neighborhoods would hardly look any different! The beauty of Backyard Homes is that they maintain the character of existing communities, because they are tiny additions that when taken together have immense implications. Unlike the usual bulky, blockbusting apartment buildings or condos, Backyard Homes are built incrementally and can be controlled not by the developer, but by the neighborhood.


<br><br>


If we could see inside each home, what we would notice would be fewer misfits between the old suburban housetype and the wide variety of current households: fewer families doubled up, fewer college kids struggling to make ends meet, fewer households moving when they reach the â€œempty nestâ€ stage of life, fewer homeless people, fewer nannies and caregivers having to commute long distances to their jobs, fewer aging parents placed in institutions far from their families.


<br><br>


In 2050, we could look at measures of Backyard Homesâ€™ success via quantifiable measures: there would be fewer home foreclosures, more affordable rental housing available, shorter commute times from home to work, increasing numbers of legal backyard units, and an abundance of new types of Backyard Homes in addition to this prototype developed by cityLAB."
3102043,2013043,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CityLife-LA.html,High School Students Shape the Future of Los Angeles, Education,"<p>The My LA2050 Challenge asks, â€œWhat does a successful Los Angeles look like to you?â€ Our idea at CityLife is to encourage the youth of Los Angeles to answer this question.  The My LA2050 Challenge invites us â€œâ€¦to dream of the most innovative and creative ways to tackle Los Angelesâ€™ biggest problems.â€  Our idea at CityLife is to offer the tools to enable the youth of Los Angeles to dream of possibilities, and to empower them to work to make their dreams a reality. </p>  





<p>CityLife has offered, throughout its 17year history, summer camp and afterschool programs.  Recently we have partnered with LAUSD to offer an English/Humanities course at Lincoln High School, during school hours and extending into afterschool.</p>





<p>The CityLife students at Lincoln High School are currently exploring urban planning issues related to the proposed Cornfield/Arroyo Seco Specific Plan (CASP) for redevelopment of the areas around the Los Angeles State Historic Park (The Cornfield), between downtown and the Los Angeles River. Working closely with our staff as well as faculty and grad students from the UCLA REMAP project, they are researching the pastâ€”what was here before, what remains, what has been lost, what should be kept or restored. They are studying what effect the CASP will have on the future â€“ on people in the immediate area, and on their community across the River in Lincoln Heights, even though it is not in the CASP area. They are discussing and proposing issues and ideas that are important for communities for all people, as well as what kinds of businesses, amenities, services, etc., make for a better city.</p> 





<p>Research and discussion are just the beginning of the process.  The CityLife students are creating an interactive digital mural as a means to present their ideas and also to engage the general community in the discussion. The mural consists of images created and photographed by students, with explanatory narrative written by students.  On the one hand, the mural fits right in with the rich mural tradition in Los Angeles.  On the other hand, it brings the tradition fully into the 21st Century, with its digital capacity of actually engaging viewers.  Motion tracking cameras will enable viewers to manipulate the content of the mural.  By waving a hand, the viewer can bring forward information about the CASP; by moving in another direction, the viewer can see the old Southern Pacific train yard (former use of the land where the Cornfield is located); yet another motion can help the viewer see into the future to analyze several alternative solutions to an urban problem. In fact, the mural is a tool for creative expression and community interaction about local urban planning issues. Our colleagues at UCLA are developing the technology, with input from the students. So in addition to being thinkers and artists, they are part of the research team of a major university!</p>  





<p>This first mural, which will be projected onto a screen at The Cornfield, will be presented by the students on May 30, 2013. For this project, students receive high school credits in English and community service.  More important, this entire process will change the way students approach problems. They will become handson participants in innovative solutions.</p>





<p>Our idea is to continue this project on several levels, all the while creating different ways of seeing, thinking and acting.</p>





<p>â€¢	Begin work with a summer program for incoming 9th graders, with current CityLife students acting as mentors for the new students.</p> 





<p>â€¢	Work next year primarily within one Small Learning Community at Lincoln, in an effort to have a broader, positive impact on the school culture, which in turn, will increase student engagement and performance.</p> 





<p>â€¢	Expand upon the work of this yearâ€™s students. Each project will end with an official public presentation and include the question, â€œWhatâ€™s next?â€ as a starting point for the following groupâ€™s project.</p> 





<p>â€¢	Work toward including students in other high schools, having our students make presentations at neighboring schools, encouraging students to become involved and develop comparable projects, and mentor them as they get going.</p> 





<p>â€¢	Create a seat at the table for young people early in the planning process.</p> 





<p>We believe that by working with teachers and administrators, as well as students, at Lincoln High, school culture will improve, student performance will increase, college attendance and jobreadiness will increase, AND the CityLife alums will become active citizens and play a leadership role in in finding innovative solutions to urban planning issues in their communities.</p>","<p>CityLife brings together young people from diverse backgrounds and offers them exposure to and experiences with the Arts, culture, history and politics of Los Angeles in order to find creative solutions to urban issues. We promote educational and interpersonal practices that encourage participants to find their own voices, become independent thinkers, be leaders within their community, and develop into adults who are good neighbors and active citizens who value learning as a means to personal growth, economic benefit and social change.</p>





<p>During every session of CityLife, participants tackle an urban issue and propose solutions to those challenges. Middle school students have designed an urban park, created public art for a redevelopment district, proposed an â€œAlley Districtâ€ in Downtown, designed possible replacements for the 6th Street Bridge across the Los Angeles River. In addition, they wrote â€œThe Sacred Spaces of Wilshire Boulevard, a Guide for Kids, by Kids,â€ published jointly by CityLife and the Los Angeles Conservancy, and remains on the Conservancy website (http://www.curatingthecity.org/sacred_spaces_kids.pdf). This project, funded by a grant from the History Channel, was a finalist for an award, which allowed us to take two participants to Washington, DC, where, among other adventures, they got to meet with staffers of Senator Feinstein and watch a debate on the Senate floor.</p>





<p>High school students created a Peopleâ€™s Promenade to connect the residential community of the William Mead Project with the Cornfield. This project was featured in an exhibit, RETHINK LA, Perspectives on a Future City, in 2011 at the A + D Museum. Students at Lincoln High created a brochure, Exploring the Centennial, using the schoolâ€™s Centennial Celebration as the impetus to identify and propose projects that would improve the campus.</p>





<p>Many of our participants have had their first exposure to classical music and have brought their entire families on CityLife outings to the Hollywood Bowl, also a first for them. Families have attended CityLife activities at MOCA, again often for the first time. And all have experienced broadening their horizons by exploring neighborhoods outside of their own, often for the first time. They have learned to examine evidence, explore issues from different perspectives, ask questions and develop opinions.</p>





<p>We know that many of our former CityLifers have gone on to attend and complete college and are starting out in careers in education, the arts, web design and marketing.  One is currently working on the CityLife staff; another is designing our website; two others are beginning to help with fundraising. </p>





<p>CityLife received a Rose Award from the Downtown Breakfast Club. And student projects have been featured in articles in the Los Angeles Downtown News and the Los Angeles Times.</p>   ","CityLife uses the city as our classroom, and in that context, has worked with collaborators and partners throughout its seventeenyear history. The major partners for this project are UCLA REMAP (http://remap.ucla.edu), a joint venture of the School of Theater, Film and Television and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, Lincoln High School and EduCare Foundation. Additional collaborators include Councilman Ed Reyesâ€™ office, The Department of City Planning, California Sate Parks and Los Angeles State Historic Park, MOCA, Grand Performances, Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, Los Angeles Conservancy, Gilmore Associates, Harley Ellis Devereaux, and other business and civic leaders as needs arise.     ","<p>The Analytical Framework put forth in the LA2050 Report, describes Education as, â€œEvidence that students are engaged in a learning process that adequately prepares them to contribute their skills, talents, and abilities to society.â€  This is consistent with the growing body of research suggesting that qualities such as student engagement, values, character, selfdiscipline, grit and studentteacher relationships are far more predictive of student success in school and in life than are test scores and IQ.  On the same page, the Report also talks about how â€œThe field is embracing broader measures of human development and wellbeingâ€“and so are we [LA2050].â€  And yetâ€¦</p> 





<p>The LA2050 report counts test scores, high school completion/drop rates, and collegegoing rates among the measures of what works in education. Those measures do not tell the complete or correct story. Test scores, for example, are increasingly being challenged as ineffective predictors of success in post secondary education. They may even lead to cheating. While high school completion matters in the job market, it doesnâ€™t tell us about careers or professions, or a studentâ€™s engagement in the community and civic affairs. In short, these measures donâ€™t really tell us what students know and can do when they finish school.  They donâ€™t tell us what kind of adults they will be. And they most likely contribute to the exact opposite of the LA2050 description.</p> 





<p>CityLife shares the LA2050 vision of Education. We live and breathe it every minute we are in session. Organizational achievements, which are really student achievements, are described in the second section above.  These serve as one important measure of our success.</p> 





<p>CityLife is based on Youth Development and Organizing models, both of which show very high correlations between youth activities and academic performance.  A recent study by the Fundersâ€™ Collaborative on Youth Organizing noted that 80% of innercity Black and Latino students involved in organizing activities improved their grades, 60% took more challenging coursework, 91% said they knew more about what they had to do to succeed in school, 95% were more motivated to finish high school, 92% were more motivated to go to college and 49% said they expected to complete graduate or professional degrees beyond college.  This is 1520% higher for degree completion than students surveyed in other national samples.  The Funderâ€™s Collaborative report describes similar differences between the Youth Organizing sample and other national samples regarding current and future political and civic engagement and commitment to activism.</p>  





<p>One member of the team of our UCLA collaborators is an evaluator.  He will work with us to develop and administer surveys to students, parents and teachers, as well as to monitor the quality of student projects. We will have both statistical and anecdotal evidence of success.</p> ","Our project will benefit Los Angeles in a variety of ways. 





â€¢	CityLife studentsasadults will know how to access â€œCity Hallâ€ and the planning process in order to provide input into the urban planning process.





â€¢	Because CityLife students will understand the importance of the arts and their role in building and maintaining strong communities, they will support and protect various arts projects in their communities as well as throughout the city.





â€¢	CityLife students will â€œspread the word,â€ reaching out to and working with students in neighboring communities.





â€¢	CityLife students will become well educated citizens of the future, which according to the LA2050 Report, is the first step toward improving the City.





â€¢	CityLife students will learn about a whole range of career possibilities in urban planning, politics and government, and related fields such as urban planning, architecture, law (land useâ€¦), environmental engineering, the arts and more.





â€¢	Perhaps some CityLife studentsasadults will run for office and become public servants.





â€¢	CityLife students will help improve the quality of their neighborhoods and communities through bottomup rather than topdown policies, planning and activities. Each time one neighborhood improves, it has a positive impact on the surrounding neighborhoods.





â€¢	CityLife projects and murals will bring information, interaction, beauty, whimsy and art to the community.





â€¢	CityLife alums will model their varied and innovative ways of seeing, thinking and acting.	


","<p>Imagine a school where students are eagerly engaged in their own learning, where they are respected and encouraged to become the best possible human beings they can be, where they welcome and mentor younger students into the school culture.  Imagine a neighborhood where children and adolescents are free from fear when walking down the street, where there are parks where children can play and centers where teens can, well, be teens. Imagine a community where the local cafÃ© is actually owned and operated by high school students and is a gathering place for young and old alike, where news is exchanged and issues are discussed, where art is displayed and music is performed. Imagine a city where art and culture are valued, where history and vibrancy are celebrated with art, where walls are enhanced with murals, where parks have gazebos for dance and band performances. Imagine a city where planning benefits local residents as well as oftenabsent developers, where local neighborhood councils are really listened to in the decisionmaking process, where young people have a seat at the table with power brokers.</p>





<p>Blight usually begins on one block and spreads to the surrounding blocks, eventually engulfing entire neighborhoods.  In fact, the definition of blight is disease, a plague. It is contagious. Its opposite is health and prosperity. The like the disease, the â€œcureâ€ begins with one project, perhaps a digital mural, on one block and can spread to the next block and the next, eventually restoring entire neighborhoods to health and prosperity. Health is also contagious, in a good way.</p>





<p>Margaret Mead said, â€œNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, itâ€™s the only thing that ever has.â€  Like the cure, this small group plants the seed and helps it grow. We, at CityLife, believe that this small group, these thoughtful, committed citizens who plant the seeds, are the middle and high school students of today and tomorrow.  They have many of the answers we seek.  Our job is to listen to them, help them refine their ideas, and support them as they work to implement them. If we give them the tools to see, think and act, we â€“ our city â€“ will reap the benefits of their ideas.</p>"
3102044,2013044,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ZenFunder.html,Civic Crowdfunding Platform for Local Government and Schools, Education,"<p>Since the financial crash of 2008 and the following recession of 2009, the budgets of our local schools have been tremendously impacted. Public administrators and teachers have lost their jobs, existing services have been cut and new projects have been abandoned. The needs of our educational institutions to provide services, however, still remain. Communities and parents are looking for new ways to fund projects that are important to them, and they are willing to open their pocket books to help out.</p>





<p>In the last year Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and others have pioneered raising money through crowdfunding. Through crowdfunding, prospective buyers can donate to various projects and products they find interesting, be it an inventors new hitech watch or a filmmakerâ€™s new movie. This method of raising money has seen incredible success in the consumer product and entertainment space, but has even more potential at raising money for educational projects. Looking at the current services  available, none are suited for civic engagement. Most crowdfunding tools in the marketplace lack the oversight and transparency necessary for educational projects.</p>





<p>CitySourced has created ZenFunder, a complete civic crowdfunding platform that combines the best of existing crowdfunding applications while at the same time offering new tools that better match the needs of local government, schools and community groups. When a parent, teacher, or administrator creates a project, the school can set requirements that must be met for initial review. Requirements can be anything the school needs to move the project forward while ensuring guidelines are followed. An example of these would be documentation, a minimum threshold of funds raised, or even a review by the district board. Once the requirements are met the school will review the project. If the project turns out to be unfeasible and the school rejects the project, the initial funds are returned. But, if the project is approved, then the community can continue to raise funds secure in knowing that once the goals are met, the project will be implemented and completed. </p>





<p>This approval workflow is what truly differentiates our crowdfunding application from every other one on the market today. From the start of when a project is submitted to the very end of its completion, all activity is tracked and recorded for public record. The community can ask questions about the project (to which either the author or the school can answer), they can comment on the project before and after funding, and the school can post updates on progress such as photos or videos of the projectâ€™s implementation. Everything is on record. Information such as which administrator or board member approved the project, key dates such as board votes, and even reasons a project does not get approved are all public knowledge for full transparency and accountability. </p>





<p>CitySourced has designed, developed and built out version one of the application and is already piloting a similar program in San Jose. We would like to expand the pilot program to include the Los Angeles Unified School District. We are also looking for ways to extend the application to enhance the community engagement capabilities and make an impact locally. To create a successful pilot program, CitySourced needs to accomplish three goals:</p>





<p>1.	Through community and school input, identify 20 projects in the LAUSD suitable for crowdfunding</p>


<p>2.	Work directly with the community, district and the schools to get the approvals needed for the projects</p>


<p>3.	Engage the community in raising funds for the various projects</p>





<p>Once the pilot program is completed, CitySourced will compile a case study documenting the best practices of educational crowdfunding for the entire process. This case study will include everything from strategies and outcomes for identifying projects, school and community collaboration and even ways to optimize the fundraising process. Deploying a successful pilot and documenting the process will allow this incredible and much needed technology to be successful around the nation. With the help of the Good and the Goldhirsh Foundation, we can make this a reality for everyone. We all want to help and pitch in, we just need the tools to do it.</p>","<p>As a leader in the civic engagement space, CitySourced has received numerous awards. Below are just a few:</p>

<p>We will measure our success by the metrics above. We will deem the campaign a success if we can: 1) create and approve at least 15 projects; 2) fund at least 10 projects or raise at least $250K in aggregate; and 3) analyze the individual projects for positive engagement using # of contributors, # of comments and # of questions as an overall indicator.</p>","Our project will directly benefit Los Angeles through a couple ways. First, monies will be directly contributed to the education system in the City of Los Angeles having the effect of providing relief to the strained resources the City's schools are currently operating under. Second, the communities surrounding the schools will benefit from improved services and program enhancements provided by the funds raised through ZenFunder. Finally, the Los Angeles community itself will become increasingly engaged. Our exhaustive research has show that  communities are willing to fund project and become more engaged, they simply haven't had the vehicle or tools to do so.","Success for us in the education indicator would be very simple. It would include: 1) improved test scores for all students in Los Angeles; 2) improved graduation rates for all students, especially those in underprivileged areas; 3) better allocation of taxpayer resources in the education system; and 4) an improved overall sense of community between the Los Angelenos and the students, teachers and administration of the LAUSD."
3102045,2013045,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CitySourcedCrimeApp.html,Smartphone App for Civic Crime Reporting, Public Safety,"Crime is pervasive in our communities and its damaging effects are well documented.  Despite the negative impacts, criminal activity and crime tips are often not reported by citizens because of fear associated with â€˜snitchingâ€™. What if we could make it extremely easy for anyone to anonymously report criminal activity and crime tips from a smartphone?  





With our easy to use smartphone, CitySourced proposes to give residents of Los Angeles a technology tool to report and monitor crime happening around them. The CitySourced crime reporting app will allow Los Angeles residents to log and categorize crime witnessed in their neighborhoods from their smartphones or the web. They will also be able to get a quick view into what crimes are happening around them by viewing other reports and public data on a map.





Regardless if reports are submitted anonymously or a user chooses to include contact telephone and email information, the CitySourced app allows for communication between citizens and public safety officials through the secure app and platform. 





In addition, the user would have several options for the crime information submitted in the reports, including discreetly adding a photo or video to a report, providing more valuable data for public safety organizations. CitySourced would be able to use this data to alert authorities to a crime in progress or add to the data available to police and the City.





The data gathered will help Los Angeles citizens be more aware of their environment and allow them to understand the location of crime hotspots in the city. By allowing twoway communication through the mobile phone between citizens and the police force we provide better service for residents affected by crime.


","CitySourced has developed a suite of award winning mobile and web civic engagement applications deployed in over 30 cities worldwide. Our mobile applications have been downloaded over 50,000 times and have brought better service and data to the residents and cities we serve. 





CitySourced is the official civic engagement platform for cities such as San Jose, Honolulu, Omaha and LAUSD. Our solution directly benefits over 13.2 million citizens worldwide, and we're deployed in six countries spread out across the globe. 





As a leader in the civic engagement space, CitySourced has received numerous awards. Below are just a few:





2009 TechCrunch50 Conference: 3rd Place (of 700 entries)


  


2009 OnDC Winner





2010 San Francisco Magazine's ""Best UrbanAction App""





2011 e.Republic Center for Digital Government's ""Best of the Web"" 





2011 GovFresh's ""Best Civic Startup"" and ""App of the Year""


 


2012 e.Republic Center for Digital Government's ""Best of California award for Best Application Serving the Public""


 


2012 California Helen Putnam Award for Excellence





2013 IBM's Beacon Award Finalist for Smarter Cities


","CitySourced has a well established relationship with many large enterprise software organizations which will great benefit the functionality of the app. Those companies include Esri, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Omega Group (crimemapping.com), and many more.


 


In addition, CitySourced has successfully deployed technology apps in Los Angeles Council District 9 and with Los Angeles Unified School district (LAUSD). Weâ€™ll harness this experience and additional account manager support to successfully deploy this project throughout all of Los Angeles.  


","CitySourced will measure its success based off citizen engagement with the app.  





Engagement is a measure of how many Angelenos download and interact with the application. We will measure download count across iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows Phone and would expect 10,000 downloads in the first 6 months.  





We would also measure the total number of reports generated through the app, and would expect to reach 25,000 in the first 18 months. In order to drive adoption, weâ€™ll run outreach and marketing campaigns to get users involved with the application. In addition, weâ€™ll provide access to our metrics dashboard to any public safety officials in Los Angeles County. 


","CitySourced Crime Reporter will make it easier for citizens to report crime to the appropriate parties for better response from law enforcement groups. We also believe that increasing the visibility of what crime is happening and where, will make it easier for policy makers to come up with targeted data driven policy and for Angelenos to be informed voters on crime prevention policy.","We envision our app to be the first step in a technological transformation between citizens and public safety organizations. By opening the lines of communication in an easy to use manner, weâ€™re providing a voice for users to submit important crime activity, while simultaneously giving law enforcement richer, more accurate data.  





As citizens generate more data for law enforcement, officials will be able to build better, smarter tools for reacting to crime in real time. In 2050, citizens will be walking sensors capable of transmitting and receiving important information around criminal activity. The net impact of terabytes of data points will be better, faster action on the part of public safety officers, more informed citizens, and a great reduction in crime. 





We believe that law enforcement, citizens, and media will use technology tools extensively that will help lower crime rates and make Los Angeles a safer city to live in.

3102046,2013046,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LACITYstageDiscovery.html,The CITYstage Arts Discovery Project,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>Imagine the anticipation: a curtain rises on a magnificent stage; the crowd hushes as orchestral horns and violins burst forth; dancers leap and seem to defy gravity; something magical has occurred. Itâ€™s happening right here in your own community, but youâ€™ll never experience it. Youâ€™re just a kid, you could never afford a ticket, and no one could take you there. In fact, this world of captivating performance and art isnâ€™t part of your world at all.</p>


<p>But it could be. Thousands of LA kids ages 1218 have never been to a professional performing arts production in dance, music or theatre. Many have never even taken a performing arts class. In fact, less than 10% of LAUSD middle school students receive instruction in a comprehensive arts program.</p>


<p>CITYstage would like to change that. Founded in direct response to the diminishing performing arts programs in LA, CITYstage is a nonprofit dedicated to inspiring and preparing inner city youth to become the future performers and arts leaders in the Los Angeles community. Currently, CITYstage provides tuitionfree summer and afterschool programs in the performing arts for underserved middle and high school students of LAUSD. But this is not enough. Answering the Goldhirsh Foundationâ€™s call to provide more opportunities for participation in and support of cultural and artistic activities, CITYstage proposes an Arts Discovery Project for youth. The goal of this program is to recruit, train and retain the next generation of creative artists.</p>


<p>How would the Arts Discovery Project do this? To start, youth would take part in â€œfield tripsâ€ to professional stage events, such as Alvin Ailey at the Music Center, Lion King at the Pantages, or the LA Phil at Walt Disney Concert Hall.</p>


<p>Itâ€™s Saturday. Imagine going to the Pantages Theatre with 49 of your classmates to see the Lion King. Before leaving for the show, you learn about the costumes and puppetry that bring the animals to life, explore the themes of the story, and learn the lyrics to â€œHakuna Matataâ€ which you discover means, â€œNo worries.â€ With much excitement, you are finally off to see the show! You arrive at the most beautiful theatre you have ever seen â€“ the historic Pantages â€“ where 50 ft. high dancers and giraffe puppets ascend the aisles amid thundering African beats. Youâ€™ve never experienced anything like it. Something magical is happening! After the performance, you meet the cast, see the puppets up close and get to ask all your burning questions. After school on Monday, the Arts Discovery staff brings in a puppet from the show and introduces you to African drumming and dance classes that you werenâ€™t even aware were available in your very own neighborhood.</p>


<p>In an effort to increase access for youth participation in â€œformalâ€ arts in Los Angeles, the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project would provide tickets and transportation for 50 LAUSD youth to attend 9 events (3 Theatre, 3 Dance, 3 Music) for a total reach of 450 youth per year. The project would foster awareness and appreciation of LAâ€™s rich cultural offerings, making professional performing art accessible for lowincome youth. According to a recent study by the Arts Education Partnership, even a small exposure can effectively result in longterm participation in the performing arts.</p>


<p>In addition to arts â€œfield trips,â€ the Arts Discovery Project would host free weekly community events, where art would be taught, learned, appreciated and shared. Fridays, from 68 p.m., LA residents would present art from their neighborhood and culture in an informal setting at Art Share LA. For example, dancers from Ballet Folklorico de Los Angeles might perform and instruct the audience in Mexicoâ€™s traditional dances.</p>


<p>Itâ€™s Friday night. Female dancers appear in colorfully embroidered skirts that seem to spin and dance on their own. Live mariachi guitars and trumpets resound with joyful, energetic melodies. Men in traditional Mexican costume stomp out powerful, percussive dance steps that interweave with the music. Your pride as an Angeleno grows as you begin to realize the diverse cultural heritage of LA. The eyes of parents in the audience light up as the value of a traditional art is passed down to a new generation.</p>


<p>With the Arts Discovery Projectâ€™s collaborative approach, we can impact the indicators identified by the Goldhirsh Foundation. Fieldtrips for 450 teens to attend professional arts performances will increase youth access to and participation in the arts, as well as fostering support and building a youth audience for formal art in the concert setting. Additionally, the projectâ€™s community events provide weekly opportunities for youth arts enrichment within their own neighborhood. Exposing our youth to a mix of formal and informal, institutional and community arts affords our students many points of entry to recruit, retain and train the next generation of artists and leaders in the LA arts scene.</p>","<p>Since our inception in 2010, CITYstage has served over 100 of LAâ€™s atrisk middle and high school youth with tuitionfree performing arts instruction in the disciplines of dance, music and theatre. Our first pilot program at Manual Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance instruction and resulted in all program graduates going on to attend 4year universities, as well as continuing to pursue the arts. </p>





<p>In 2012, we expanded our pilot program to include instruction in all three performing arts disciplines for 35 students at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School. CITYstage also ensured highquality instruction by employing working professionals in the LA performing arts community. During an Arts Discovery pilot, 25 students were taken to a variety of events including youth standup comedy at The Improv, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at the Ahmanson Theatre and music and dance performances at the Colburn School. </p>





<p>Students who visited the Colburn School live in the shadow of Downtown LA, yet had never visited the cultural center of their own city â€“ less than 3 miles from home. They marveled at the sight of LAâ€™s skyline; the discipline and training required to develop the ballet dancer physique and enjoyed the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge of classical ballet positions in their discussion of the performance.</p>





<p>In late 2012, CITYstage formed a partnership with All About Kids to serve 50 additional children who are victims of domestic violence and abuse. With this partnership, mental health support was made a new priority for CITYstage. </p>





<p>In a conscious effort to provide our youth with leadership opportunities, we have added a former graduate of the Manual Arts High CITYstage pilot program to our Board of Directors as the first Student Director. We believe that including students on our board empowers them to become the next generation of leaders and advocates of LA culture and art. The Student Director role also gives a powerful voice to our most important stakeholders â€“ our students. We can only ensure the viability of our programs and build a lasting foundation for the arts if we actively listen to and address the needs of the communities we serve. </p>","CITYstage will create partnerships across the education, arts, business and nonprofit sectors. Art Share LA will provide theatre and rehearsal space for Arts Discovery events. To recruit youth participants, CITYstage will work with LAUSD middle and high school principals and faculty at the following schools: Audubon, Carver, Clinton, John Muir, Crenshaw, Dr. Maya Angelou, Manual Arts, Jefferson, Foshay Learning Center. We intend to partner with venues including: Music Center, The Pantages, Disney Concert Hall, Comedy Sportz, and Center Theatre Group. Corporate partners Goldstar Events, LA Weekly and ADVOC8 will be key to successful outreach. Collaborations with nonprofits KKJZ, KCRW, UCLA GSE&IS, will provide exposure and project support.","<p>A balanced evaluation of the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project would include meeting measurable objectives set by the CITYstage Board of Directors, as well as an external study and analysis by an accredited academic research organization to inform and improve learning opportunities and model change in education research, policy and practice.</p>





<p>Measurable objectives include: </p>





<p>450 innercity youth exposed to the professional LA arts scene through Arts Discovery field trips (50 youth per fieldtrip x 9 events = 450 students/year)</p>





<p>1,000 local residents and youth participating in performing arts in Arts Discovery community events (up to 50 weekly participants x 20 weeks of programming = 1,000 participants/year)</p>





<p>CITYstage partnerships with at least 3 professional performing arts venues</p>





<p>Partnerships with at least 4 LAUSD schools to continue Arts Discovery beyond year one</p>





<p>In addition, CITYstage would perform an internal audit and survey of participants to evaluate learning and enrichment experience, with feedback and suggestions to improve future programming. </p>





<p>A third party evaluation is necessary to fully assess the project and identify opportunities for improvement. CITYstage would seek a partnership with the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Department of Education to conduct research and analysis of the projectâ€™s impact on students, families and schools. The UCLA GSE&IS Department of Education is an international leader in the study and practice of K16 urban education, student testing and assessment, teacher and continuing education and development  particularly in urban, multiethnic environments, and issues of access, equity, and quality. </p>





<p>Data could be collected on whether local youth continue participating in the arts beyond the Arts Discovery field trip experience, and what impact the project has on academic performance, student retention rates and the pursuit of continued education. Alternately, participants might be interviewed about perceptions of community, race relations and future levels of interest in participating in the arts.</p>





At the end of each year, CITYstage would formally review the projectâ€™s internal audit survey results alongside the findings and recommendations of UCLA GSE&IS. This combined evaluation would inform future plans for Arts Discovery to provide opportunities for community arts enrichment in LA. In addition to significantly enhancing the development of innercity youth and the underserved communities that they live in, and contributing to the body of academic work that strengthens support for artsrelated policy, our hope is that the Arts Discovery Project would become a model for successful arts enrichment programs in other metropolitan areas.","A diversity of LAâ€™s stakeholders stand to benefit from the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project including innercity youth, LAUSD schools, local artists, professional artists and venues, arts nonprofits and the local community. Below outlines the specific benefits each group would acquire along with a list of advantages gained from their participation.





Innercity youth would gain: opportunities to participate in and contribute to the cultural landscape of LA; chances to explore and develop their creative mind; access to afterschool arts programs that provide safe and productive environments; pathways and possibilities for success in the future including higher education and careers in the arts and other creative industries.





LAUSD middle and high schools would benefit from: outside resources to address the lack of comprehensive arts programming in public schools; improved academic achievement, student retention and graduation rates; solid research to build the case for lasting policy and curriculum change in support of the arts in schools.





Local artists would gain: a venue for sharing their talent and art; a supportive space for experimentation, growth and development of their craft; free event marketing resources for greater visibility of upandcoming artists; financial support for their participation.





Professional artists and arts venues would benefit in the following ways: growth of a new generation of young audience members to sustain future support; access to previously untapped markets (innercity youth and the underserved communities of LA); direct financial support to metropolitan arts/cultural venues with an additional 450 attendees per year; opportunities to make the â€œformalâ€ concert arts more accessible to our youth in the form of discount group tickets, â€œtalkbacksâ€ with youth after performances, â€œsneakpeeksâ€ into rehearsals, guest lectures, and artist workshops.





Arts nonprofits would gain: opportunities to collaborate with other nonprofit arts providers that will strengthen youth arts programs across the county; a model for collaboration between local arts programs.





The LA community, as a whole, will benefit from: weekly opportunities to participate in free classes and performances that celebrate the diversity of LA; a stronger business climate due to the growth of creative industries; a betterinformed, connected and engaged citizenry; the development of a more vibrant and inclusive arts community; a public mandate for greater arts support in schools and the community.





In order to change the future of Los Angeles and further enrich the arts and cultural vitality of the city, projects like CITYstage Arts Discovery need to engage all members of our communityregardless of race, income or geography. It is through this inclusive approach that we will see continued growth into 2050 and beyond, ensuring Los Angeles as a model and leader in sustained arts and cultural vitality. 


","<p>Itâ€™s 2050. You are 49 years old and have been teaching dance in the LAUSD for the past 26 years. You just finished teaching your 7th grade students the history of Alvin Ailey, an African American choreographer and activist who formed the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre over 90 years earlier. You are reminded of 6th grade when you took your fist CITYstage Arts Discovery â€œfield tripâ€ to see the Alvin Ailey company at the Music Center. The agility and grace of the dancers inspired you to try a dance class in your community. For the next 7 years, you attended classes at CITYstage and Lula Washington Dance Theatre and experienced breathtaking performances through the annual Arts Discovery â€œfield trips.â€ You realize now that the introduction and continued exposure to the arts as a child helped you grow into the passionate, creative and dedicated teacher you are today. </p>





<p>We believe that if we introduce resources like the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project in 2013, we can help develop and support the future artists and leaders of 2050. The ability to ignite creativity and passion in our youth, and to empower our citizens, organizations and policymakers is the key to sustaining a vibrant arts and cultural scene in our region.</p>





<p>How would this specifically impact the artistic and cultural vitality of LA in 2050? If we start now, over the next 37 years CITYstage can provide a minimum of 16,576 of LAâ€™s most atrisk teens opportunities to participate and contribute to LAâ€™s vibrant arts landscape. 


Using the inspiration, training and support provided by the Arts Discovery Project, we believe that a significant number of our youth will discover pathways out of poverty through careers as artists or in artsrelated fields such as education, artsbusiness or advocacy. </p>





<p>With success and possibilities born from the arts, advocates will not leave their fate to chance, but will demand commonsense legislative support such as: creating comprehensive arts programs for LAUSD middle and high school students; earmarking funds for increased percapita arts spending; tax breaks to encourage film production in LA, and the like. The revitalization of the business of the arts is crucial to expanding the LA arts scene and realization of the cityâ€™s full potential as both an economic and a creative powerhouse.</p>





<p>We believe in the power of innercity youth to shape the future of arts in Los Angeles. With this in mind, we will work toward a Los Angeles 2050 in which we nurture home grown artists and artsleaders to help maintain LAâ€™s dominance as the leading US arts center for generations to come. Furthermore, securing a future in which a concentration of these artists and leaders are from the underserved communities of LA ensures that all Angelenos have access to the arts, regardless of race, income or geography.</p>"
3102047,2013047,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/PickUpPopUpProduce.html,PickUp PopUp Produce Station, Health,"The Pick Up, PopUp Produce Station provides reliable access to fresh, affordable and healthful food grown in community gardens to commuters and local residents in the vicinity of transit stations.  The project impacts community health by improving food access and proposes a replicable prototype implementable across the county.





This prototype is adjacent to the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line Station. We propose to install a dismountable produce stand in close proximity to the station accessible from 103rd street, capturing pedestrian activity. The produce station will be packable, transportable and will transform into an active and engaging retail environment accommodating daily selling of produce, as well as serving as a backdrop for special events. Mudtown Farms in conjunction WLCAC will provide the fresh produce from their local farm located five blocks from the station.





The Watts Labor Community Action Committee will provide operational support for the PopUp Produce Station through training and administering a workforce, offering other administrative support, and community outreach.   In order to make people aware of the project, a series of events centered on the PopUp Produce Station will be staged by Project Food LA to activate the relationship between the transit hub and the food system.


 


Osborn Architects will design and oversee the construction and initial deployment of the produce stand, obtain necessary approvals, and involve the stakeholders in the design process.  Project Food LA will administer programming and special events to the PopUp Produce Station at its initial installation.  Civic Projects, along with Osborn, will coordinate implementation and communication between the stakeholder organizations and agencies, and provide a strategic planning infrastructure so the project can be successfully maintained for the ongoing, achievement of project goals for a duration of five years by the WLAC and Project Food LA â€“ the project goals being to provide reliable access to fresh, affordable and healthful food to commuters and local residents at the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line Station.

","Success will be measured by multiple, and wideranging, factors, including but not limited to the following:





1. Overall health of the community as determined by studies carried out by parties independent of the project, over a period of five years.


2. The number of people served by the stand over the course of days, weeks, months, up to a period of five years.


3. The amount of produce sold by the stand over the course of days, weeks, months, up to a period of five years.


4. The number of people participating in the workforce and job training aspects of the program.


5. The revenue versus the costs of the program.


6. The length of time the workforce and job trainees stay with the produce stand.


","The immediate station area, and the larger neighborhood, is notably underserved by grocery stores, both in terms of quality and number. Access to nutritious food in grocery stores is taken for granted in more affluent neighborhoods. In this station area, residents' options are severely limited to fast food outlets or overpriced and substandard produce and groceries. The station serves a moderately dense residential area, with pedestrian traffic around the station throughout the day, and heavy pedestrian traffic at rush hour. The PopUp Produce Station will be a community resource besides offering access to nutritious produce by providing work and job training opportunities for neighborhood residents.


 


Our proposal links the products of Mudtown Farms, five blocks from the station, to the pedestrians around the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line Station, providing convenient, affordable and reliable access, by transit users and pedestrians, to nutritious produce grown in the community garden. Our project will supplement the Mudtown Farms Phase III plan, which recently received a Proposition 84 State Parks Grant to enhance and maintain their urban farm. The PopUp Produce Station will act as a vendor outpost to the Farms. Produce grown and harvested at the farm will supply the produce stand, providing the local farmers with a reliable pedestrian consumer pool.

3102048,2013048,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/climateresolve.html,Climate Resolve: Inspiring LA to Prosper in a Changing Climate, Environmental Quality,"In 2050, Los Angeles will be 4 to 5 degrees hotter, access to water vastly diminished, wildfires and flooding more intense and frequent, and the sea level will be 5 to 9 inches higher, all because of climate change. The good news is there is plenty we can do to get ready for these changes, reduce impacts, and, most importantly, make Los Angeles a better place to live. To have a great LA in 2050, we have to start now. 





<br><br>Climate Resolve will use the LA2050 award to galvanize Los Angeles to become better prepared, safer, and more prosperous in the face of a changing climate. We will (1) release three new studies on how the climate will change in Los Angeles by 2050, (2) hold two community climate meetups to initiate action on climate solutions, and (3) install a cool roof on lowincome apartments to demonstrate a proven solution.





<br><br>SEEING LAâ€™S CLIMATE FUTURE





<br><br>First, we will work with our partners at UCLA to ensure that Angelenos understand the emerging science on LA area climate impacts, using our proven communications strategy. UCLA scientists are modeling what LA will look like in 2050. And Climate Resolve is shaping that vision.





May to September 2013, Climate Resolve will assist UCLA in the release of climate studies on changes in snowfall in our local mountains, LA area precipitation, and Santa Ana wind conditions by 2050. Climate Resolve help people understand how these studies will affect their lives. Similar to the midcentury temperature study (described below), we will work with media to help ensure the science gets reported accurately and is relatable to the public. We will design maps, graphics, and posters that readily describe the findings in an accessible way, and incorporate the studies into the website CCHANGE.LA so people can continue to have access to the latest science.





<br><br>CLIMATE MEETUPS: BUILDING RESILIENCE IN LA NEIGHBORHOODS





<br><br>Not just reporting on our future but creating it, Climate Resolve will work with local leaders in two LA communities to look at neighborhoodscale impacts, and identify real, positive solutions that work in these neighborhoods. During the Fall and Winter of 2013, Climate Resolve will host two intensive community climate meetups through which we will work with community leaders, invite trusted messengers, and listen to community concerns. We anticipate engaging our partners in this phase to bring together the collective expertise and leadership on community engagement and environmental stewardship in Los Angeles. UCLA scientists will discuss climate impacts. Environmental practitioners will share solutions they have successfully employed around the city.





<br><br>Each community climate meetup will have two phases, beginning virtually with live Twitter parties where we engage community members in rapid, thoughtful, and inspiriting dialogue about climate impacts and solutions. One week later, we will host a followon inperson meetup with the agenda informed by the outcomes of the Twitter party. The inperson meetup will bring community members together with civic and environmental leaders to collectively identify policy measures and real, tangible actions that will prepare Los Angeles for a changing climate. The climate meetup process will enable the people of Los Angeles to develop and implement solutions for their communities, working jointly with local environmental leaders, academic experts, and Climate Resolve. The result will be identification and action on priority community projects, such as installing a cool roof on a lowincome apartment, a shady park with a cool playground, or a greenway along a stretch of accessible waterway. 





<br><br>The climate meetups will result in action, the beginning of Los Angeles buildingup the social infrastructure to meet the climate crisis. Climate Resolve will work with our partners, including the City of Los Angeles, to obtain resources and get the job done. With Climate Resolveâ€™s strong relationships at City Hall, we anticipate great success. When proven effective, we will expend the climate meetup model citywide, continuing beyond the LA2050 project. 





<br><br>SHARING SUCCESS: INSPIRING ANGELENOS TO TAKE ACTION 





<br><br>We will promote success stories via Twitter, Facebook and other social media, providing a place for people to post pictures and videos of what theyâ€™re able to accomplish in their neighborhood or home or school. This will show people how easy it can be to take action.





<br><br>MAKE LA COOL: START WITH WHAT WORKS





<br><br>Cool roofs are a lowcost, accessible and proven solution to keeping Angelenos comfortable and safe, reducing air conditioning costs, and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. For LA2050, Climate Resolve will spearhead a project to outfit an existing lowincome apartment building in Los Angeles with a cool roof. We will work with residents to help track comfort and costsavings as a proof of concept that cool roofs are an effective solution.


","<br><br>Climate Resolve was founded in 2011 to meet an enormous unmet need. Americaâ€™s secondlargest city did not have an organization dedicated to the climate crisis. Since then, Climate Resolve has collaborated with scientists and government on cuttingedge scientific research, communicated science to the public, and created solutions to meet this generational challenge and make Los Angeles a more livable place today and in the future. Climate Resolve is the only organization exclusively working to get Los Angeles ready for 2050.





<br><br>From the start, Climate Resolve forged key relationships with local researchers, including a lasting collaboration with UCLAâ€™s Dr. Alex Hall, a leading global expert on regional climate impacts. Dr. Hall developed a groundbreaking research method to model climate impacts at the local level. Released last June, â€œMidCentury Warming in the Los Angeles Region,â€ shows temperatures at the neighborhood level. Before this study, global climate models lumped Los Angeles into a single data point, ignoring key influences of the local landscape such as mountain ranges, coastal zones, and valleys. UCLA will continues its research on how other climate factors will transform Los Angeles by 2050.





<br><br>In June 2012, Climate Resolve organized the public release of the UCLA study on midcentury warming that reveals, with unprecedented specificity, how much warmer Los Angeles will be by 2050. We now know that most neighborhoods will be warmer by 4 to 5 degrees (F) by 2050, and certain neighborhoods will experience especially severe changes. Hollywood, Eagle Rock, Downtown, and Watts will have between two to four more days per year of extremely high temperatures (above 95ÂºF). The San Fernando Valley, specifically Woodland Hills, Porter Ranch, Sunland and Sylmar will have twelve to twenty more days per year of extremely high temperatures.





<br><br>After the release, Climate Resolve immediately began working on solutions to help Los Angeles prosper despite a warmer future and identified a costeffective proven solution that works well in our climate, cool roofs. In March 2013, Climate Resolve launched a Hot City, Cool Roofs initiative to help homeowners and apartment dwellers cool down, by hosting a free conference attended by over 300 Angelenos including Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who gave the keynote address. The Mayor announced that Los Angeles Building and Safety will develop new codes for the installation of reflective roofing materials on all homes and apartment buildings. LADWP announced it will expand cool roofs incentives to offset the cost of installation. 





<br><br>Climate Resolve also developed a webbased centralized clearinghouse of information on solutions for climate change in Los Angeles located on the Do Something tab of the webpage CCHANGE.LA. Here anyone can locate helpful ideas and incentives provided by local and states governments to support implementation and learn about success stories for climate acti","UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Los Angeles Regional Collaborative for Climate Action and Sustainability, Council for Watershed Health, Tree People, Romel Pascual, Deputy Mayor, Office of the Environment, City of Los Angeles, Green LA Coalition, Interfaith Power and Light


","In the near term we will measure our success by tracking: (1) the reach of our climate science communications in terms of the number of news outlets and blogs that carry stories about the forthcoming UCLA studies after their release and visitors to the website CCHANGE.LA; (2) attendance at community meetups, number of partner organizations engaged, and use of social media to organize and exchange ideas within communities; (3) implementation of numerous local actions to prepare for climate change; (4) installation of one cool roof on a low income apartment building with measurable benefits. 





In the long term, beyond the LA2050 seed project, we will measure our success by the number of communities mobilizing to develop and implement solutions for climate change and the number of civic, academic, business and environmental leaders participating with Climate Resolve to build a better future. Over the next ten years, we hope to see widespread community level engagement in climate change planning and implementation of multibenefit solutions. We will track progress visually on our website, maintaining a map of Los Angeles that shows progress one neighborhood at a time, tracking the evolving landscape as Los Angeles develops a better future.","Using the LA2050 grant, Climate Resolve will help inform Los Angeles of the climate changes to come so that we can anticipate, prepare for, and reduce the impacts of climate change, while at the same time we help two of the most vulnerable communities in Los Angeles identify solutions and mobilize to take action to make their neighborhood better, stronger, and more resilient to climate change. 





But our vision extends well beyond the work we will do in 20132014. Climate Resolve will leverage our experience, successes, lessons learned, and new partnerships developed with the LA2050 seed funding to scaleup the process into a longterm, citywide effort of coordinated communitybased climate planning and engagement. Climate Resolve will be a â€œbig tentâ€ where nonprofit organizations, businesses, civic leaders, and communities can convene to help one another prepare for climate change.  ","Los Angeles will have empowered communities that are prosperous, safe, comfortable, and healthy places to live. Starting now, communities will begin identifying and implementing strategies to get ready for climate change and reduce negative impacts, by identifying and achieving workable solutions. In 2050, communities across Los Angeles will have implemented actions and the city will look like this:





Angelenos will under cool and green roofs. Our children will play on cool playgrounds. Los Angeles will be laced with a network of neighborhood cooling centers in our schools, libraries, community centers, and parks to help the most vulnerable Angelenos escape extreme heat.





The landscape will be populated with shade trees, drought tolerant native plants, and permeable surfaces to conserve water and provide beautiful spaces for all to enjoy.





Major waterways will be flanked by publically accessible greenways planted with vegetation to recapture storm water, prevent floods, and recharge our groundwater so that people in Los Angeles can get their drinking water from reliable and inexpensive local supplies.  





Where sea level rise is a concern, the first floors of multilevel buildings will be retrofitted to parking and other uses that can withstand occasional floods and single story buildings will be elevated above flood levels.  





People will bike, walk, and ride the bus, trains, and subways to get just about anywhere they need to go.





Electricity from renewable sources will run the city and be produced from distributed sourcesâ€”like solar panels on the rooftops of residential and commercial buildings.  





Los Angeles will also be a city where we take better care of each other. Communities will be connected through social media and have plans and procedures for protecting the most vulnerable when there are high rains, severe winds, fire warnings, heat waves, and floods. The City of Los Angeles will be prepared and able to respond rapidly when severe weather occurs. No one will be left isolated and alone in the face of these challenges."

We want to see Dante, a finishing carpenter and trained journeyman in his fifties, living in South Los Angeles, who remembers a time when city infrastructure projects meant work for his community, see his son, his niece, his friend, his neighbor, work again; see people from his neighborhood working on the subway line that will be under construction a few blocks from his home. We are dedicated to joining in Danteâ€™s fight to end chronic unemployment and underemployment in his community. <p>In Los Angeles, black unemployment hovers at nearly 20 percent, and is estimated to be significantly higher for black men ages 16 to 25. Of those who are employed, thirty percent of black workers in LA are in lowwage industries, earning $12 per hour or less. Lack of jobs and lowpaying jobs in black communities in Los Angeles relate to specific health issues, including mental health risks like stress, depression and drug addiction. </p><p>Partnership for Black Workers Rising is a project of the Coalition of Mental Health Professionals that will advance our goal to empower local residents to take charge of their communities. Created in collaboration with the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, the Partnership for Black Workers Rising project is rooted in the Civil Rights model of organizing community and workers to advocate for social justice. The project will focus on economic justice as a vehicle for African Americans living in Los Angeles to successfully navigate the problems of everyday life and to end the job crisis in our communities. </p><p>The Partnership for Black Workers Rising challenges employers to foster equity and transparency in hiring practices, and provides a safe space for black workers to openly discuss issues related to their experiences in the workplace. The main objective is to offer peer support and solutions to address racism, discrimination as well as build skills and networks to turn knowledge into action. Our longterm goals of are to dismantle the barriers of employment discrimination, create access to quality jobs, and transform lowpaying, lowskilled jobs into fulfilling and sustaining careers and vocations through unionization and leadership development. This project will develop the next generation of black leaders and a thriving black workforce in Los Angeles by promoting public policy advocacy and providing community education and leadership development. </p>Public Policy Advocacy


The project will continue our current programs that develop tools such as a â€œcompliance report cardâ€ to engage community members in monitoring local hiring agreements in public construction projects. At the LA Black Worker Center the focus has been on: 1) compliance with antidiscrimination policies under the Civil Rights Act; 2) community relations; 3) access for all workers; 4) transparency in hiring practices; and 5) diversity on the job site. The compliance report card is an empowerment tool that gives community a voice in hiring standards, holds employers and agencies accountable, and brings workers and community together. We intentionally engage all residents in our monitoring campaigns, in part to build trust among diverse communities of Los Angeles, and to strengthen calls for economic justice, especially in communities of color. We will continue to provide community members with opportunities to educate their neighbors and disseminate information locally. In addition, local residents will disseminate results among peers and use this project to develop additional tools on future local project labor agreements.





Community Education and Leadership Development


We will provide trainings and mentorship for young black residents to increase their access and retention in construction and utility careers. We will expand current programs that prepare workers for the regulated construction industry by connecting young workers to experienced black workers in the building and construction trade unions. We recruit mentors in trade unions who can guide young black workers through the apprenticeship process. Mentees benefit from gaining broader perspectives and strategies for longterm, quality career choices and a support system and network contacts. This mentorship program promotes sustainable avenues for earning a living and positive intergenerational peer interaction.





Within our education and mentorship program, we provide leadership development trainings that aim to prepare the next generation of workers, including union, lowwage, and the unemployed, to advocate for local improvements and mobilize our communities for change. Workers will build skills to develop campaigns and frame messages for the media. The idea is to advance the conversation from simply addressing individual solutions to strategies for systemic change that target the root cause of joblessness and underemployment in our community and build power for lowwage workers. ","<p>Los Angeles Metro (Metropolitan Transit Authority) Target Hiring Policy: In a coalition of local government agencies, trade unions and community organizations, we were central to a Public Works Projects Campaign to advocate that the Los Angeles County Metro adopt a fiveyear agreement that requires a targeted hiring program for transit projects, ultimately creating an estimated 23,000 union construction jobs. The agreement is the nationâ€™s first master project labor agreement approved by a regional transportation agency. The campaign ensured the agreement incorporate rigorous diversity language. This language includes stronger disadvantaged criteria, including the formerly incarcerated and those emancipated from foster care; a requirement that disadvantaged workers be defined by at least two criteria; and federal civil rights and equal opportunity language, which includes affirmative action enforcement and monitoring. </p>





<p>Community Monitoring System and Compliance Report Card: The LA Black Worker Center (BWC) developed and piloted a community monitoring tool to foster greater community and worker participation in decisionmaking processes and to increase access to information in the public contraction arena. The tool provides a mechanism for accountability to the community on public infrastructure investments and how jobs are created. The BWC worked with graduate students and undergraduate research interns to develop a community monitoring tool called the â€œPublic Construction Report Card,â€ which allows local residents and workers to evaluate and grade contractorsâ€™ past practices of employing a representative workforce. The report card evaluated contractors by using indicators such as community outreach and relations, accessibility, civil rights compliance, and transparency. The BWC supervised a team of BWC members and students who tested the report card tool in the field. The tool focused on four bidding contractors on the $1.7 billion Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor Project. Though this was a test of the tool, the results proved the public construction report card was a powerful monitoring mechanism in the highstakes conversations with the contractors. In the end, each contractor team pledged to improve their â€œgradesâ€ and invited the BWC to be directly involved in their workforce pipeline process. The results of the report card pilot became the subject of highlevel discussions between the office of Congresswoman Karen Bass, construction team executives, BWC members, and LA Metro staff. </p>


","Leadership Development and Mentorship Partners: AfricanAmerican Sheetmetal Workers Association; Black Labor Construction Council; IBEW Local 11; SEIU 721; AFSCME International Union;  MAâ€™AT Institute for Change;  SEIU United LongTerm Care Workers, and SEIU Local 721.

","The Coalition will evaluate project activities and measure success in three ways: 1 ) participant feedback; 2) partner response; and 3) operational assessment.  





The specific evaluation processes are:


1)	We will conduct surveys with participants at trainings to learn about their assessment of the materials, presentations, and accessibility of our facilitators, along with their suggestions for improvements. We will also collect data on the number of attendees. 


2)	We will interview partners about their experiences in the collaboration, troubleshoot during project implementation, and assimilate their recommendations into the development of new collaborative efforts. We also measure the success of partnerships by interest from new partners. 


3)	We will participate in an evaluation process by an external team and will apply the assessment of our strengths and shortcomings to operations and implementation of other projects. In addition, we will continue our periodic assessments of programs by debriefing with staff, reviewing participant surveys, and analyzing attendance statistics.





The overall success of our leadership development and community monitoring tools will be measured by the number of young black community members who enter preapprenticeship programs, participate in advocacy projects with local organizations, and ultimately join the workforce. 


","The Partnership for Black Workers Rising will benefit Los Angeles by increasing Black workersâ€™ access to quality construction jobs, holding agencies accountable for ensuring diversity in public works, and creating mechanisms to monitor agency management of project labor implementation. Our mentorship program will prepare young workers for the regulated construction industry. Our grassroots leadership development programs will prepare the next generation of union and community leaders. Our outreach will develop new and durable multiethnic alliances to fight for an end to joblessness and build a peaceful and prosperous LA. 





Ultimately, the Partnership for Black Workers Rising will reinvigorate a tradition of community action and revive areas of Los Angeles where economic growth has all but stalled. Increasing black workersâ€™ access to quality employment will lay the groundwork to build a Los Angeles economy that includes all residents and all neighborhoods. Black workers trained through our programs will have skills to advocate for improving not only access to jobs but also resources to address health needs, neighborhood improvement, and equity and transparency that keeps Los Angeles on the track to economic justice for all. 





","<p>In 2050, Los Angeles black workers will be represented fairly in the Los Angeles labor market through access to quality jobs, the power of worker organization and discriminationfree work sites. The LA black job crisis will be history. Policy makers will recognize that race and place impact the level of access and opportunity for quality employment. All policies meant to address unemployment and underemployment in LA will ensure the communities hardest hit by economic downtown participate in city economic growth. </p>





<p>LA economic development and enforcement policies will be the model for a racial equity agenda that ensures there are enough resources to include all workers regardless of race and gender at workforce table, particularly in cityfunded economic development projects.  </p>





<p>In 2050, the power of alliances among organized labor, community members, workers, civil rights organizations and multiethnic organizations will have successfully designed, adopted, and implemented a racial equity policy and enforcement agenda that transforms industries beyond the public construction sector to be the leading channels for black workforce development training pipelines. Los Angeles will be a model of public and private/public projects that represent the black community and by extension the black workers whose tax dollars help to fund infrastructure projects. </p>





<p>By 2050, we will remember that it was the power of the people that challenged all of LA to address the state of racial and economic justice with innovative tools and fresh ideas. Grassroots worker leadership and strategic communitylabor alliances will have been the remedy to the broken opportunity ladder for black workers in Los Angeles. The job crisis of chronic unemployment and underemployment will no longer badly fray the social fabric of black communities and undermine LAâ€™s economic security. The alliances and policies that this project builds today will fuel proworker economic policies, investment in urban communities and racial equality in the labor market in years to come. By 2050, black workers will be in a position of decisionmaking not only to demand equity, transparency and accountability to achieve equal access to meaningful, sustained, and quality employment for all workers, but in positions to lead major projects in a variety of industries with a commitment to equity, transparency and accountability for all of Los Angeles.</p>

3102050,2013050,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CollaborativeTutor.html,Mentoring through Education Movement, Education,"At Collaborative Tutoring, we believe in working in collaboration with community partners to utilize resources to guide and support children and young individuals from all walks of life towards success; while fostering positive learning environments- through education, mentorship, community service, and volunteerism. 


The Mentoring through Education Movement (MEM) project is based on an innovative student-centered approach combined with mentoring and experiential learning to revolutionize traditional ways of learning. The MEM project will allow youth and young adults (in the 7th-12th grades) coming from high-crime, high-poverty communities within Los Angeles County, to receive high-quality tutoring services in combination with real life experiential learning through volunteerism, community service, and restorative justice.  Volunteerism will play a large role in the studentâ€™s education by promoting learning both inside and outside the classroom. Students will volunteer with non-profit organizations for a minimum of 21 hours over the course of the project. Types of volunteering opportunities will positively impact: the environment (i.e. conservation), community enhancement, education, the homeless, humanitarian efforts, etc. All volunteerism and community service activities will promote altruism for the greater good of humanity. Restorative justice will be carried out through the power of poetry, art, creative writing, and/or skits/plays created by the students, which will be showcased at Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s Mentoring through Education Movement Celebration.Collaborative Tutoring focuses on the meaningful experiences young people encounter within their lives. Our â€œEducator/Mentorsâ€ will provide one-on-one and/or small group tutoring and mentorship, using the studentâ€™s Life Plan as a tool towards success. This movement will allow students to experience education with a whole new approach through relationship building. Our goal is transform our studentâ€™s way of learning through various avenues. Not only will students learn within the classroom setting, but they will continue their learning through experiences outside of the classroom. 


The MEM project is expected to develop teaching communities in which teaching not only happens in the classroom, but within the communities in LA as well. Teaching communities will allow students at a middle school and high school level to teach both adults and children by using what they have learned within their experiences. For example, a high school student could adopt a â€œreading buddyâ€ to improve literacy among elementary school-aged children. These teaching communities could be modeled and replicated in all environments and among all ages- young and old. A harsh reality in LA is that our young people either are, or are at high-risk of dropping out of high school, being on probation/incarcerated, entering gangs, becoming homeless, etc. Due to the lack of access to resources, it is through the Mentoring through Education Movement that will continue to educate and guide young individuals towards success within their lives. In addition to tutoring services, Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s MEM will provide Life Skills workshops, to enhance young peopleâ€™s socio-emotional development and leadership skills. Workshops include, but are not limited to: using Microsoft Office, basic computer skills (i.e. typing), Internet use, E-mail, FAFSA, CAHSEE & college prep, parenting, job readiness, budgeting, health, technology, etc. Successful completion of the program will allow students the chance to become part of the MEM Internship program. MEM Alumni will be able to apply to become an intern with one of our collaborating partners. Within this internship program, young individuals will have access to a business mentor/s in the workforce. 


Through Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s Mentoring through Education Movement, we expect the project to impact education with an increase in:


â€¢	Life skills, leadership and personal development


â€¢	Confidence levels within their education


â€¢	High School Diploma attainment and graduation rates


â€¢	Passing of CAHSEEâ€™s and/or TABE (Test of Basic Adult Education) test scores


â€¢	College going rates and/or the desire to attend college (community college, 4 year institution, trade school, etc.)


â€¢	Knowledge of college preparation (FAFSA, college apps, college navigation)


â€¢	Knowledge of career exploration and goals


â€¢	Knowledge and use of skills/tools (communication, Microsoft Office, typing, e-mail, etc.)


â€¢	Knowledge and access to resources within their communities


Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s ultimate goal is to advocate for our young people and close the gap that disconnects community resources, educational systems, and issues negatively affecting their lives.


The Mentoring through Education Movement program will be a tool for students to use in collaboration with partners within the community, to improve education, while enriching their lives and the communities in ","<p>Collaborative Tutoring is an organization driven by the ultimate goal of collaborating with businesses, organizations, agencies, the young people, and their families to promote teaching through mentoring. Collaborative Tutoring has been able to connect with community-based-organizations and other agencies to provide services and resources to not only students in the Collaborative Tutoring program, but to at-risk and high-risk youth and young adults in low-income communities. We have also implemented an informal mentoring model embedded within the organizationâ€™s structure to improve student educational success and their socio-emotional development as well.</p>





<p>We have also been able to connect with collaborative partners to provide internship opportunities within their businesses/organizations. </p>





<p>It is our goal to continue to develop and implement a structured Mentoring and Internship program for our students.</p> 


","We will partner with post-secondary institutions including, but not limited to four year institutions and community colleges within the Los Angeles County (i.e., Rio Hondo College, East Los Angeles College, Citrus College, etc.), local artists, college students, teachers, charter schools, schools within LAUSD, community-based organizations, local businesses, agencies, etc. We also will reach out to business owners and entrepreneurs, parents, volunteers, and other community members in order to successfully implement the project. ","<p>Collaborative Tutoring will evaluate the Mentoring through Education Movement using several methods. We will create an evaluation plan, which states our objectives, desired results, our indicators and data to measure our results, and sources of data. In combination with the evaluation plan, we will conduct quarterly SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). This will allow our organization to evaluate the project to see if we met our objectives and deliverables and make adjustments as needed. </p>


<p>A studentâ€™s educational progress will be tracked using mid and post progress reports. In addition to this, data will be collected using Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s pre and post assessment and educational data collection tools, TABE tests, standardized test scores, ASCA National Standards Developmental Competencies and leadership competencies tracking tools.</p>


<p>Collaborative Tutoring will evaluate the mid-progress and final delivery of the Mentoring through Education Movement project with stakeholders (i.e. Advisory Committee, educator/mentors, parents, community members, etc.) and student satisfaction; asking questions such as:</p>


<p>â€¢	Were you satisfied with the result?</p>


<p>â€¢	Did the delivery of the final result run smoothly?</p>


<p>â€¢	Was the scope and objectives of the project representative of project delivery?</p>


<p>â€¢	Was the plan for project resources adequate?</p>


<p>â€¢	What could have been improved to make the project successful?</p>


<p>In addition to this, we will use KPI (Key Performance Indicators) to help us measure progress and success toward our project objectives.</p> 


<p>We anticipate that:</p>


<p>â€¢	Students under this project will show a 40-60%% increase in the subjects of Math or English Language Arts- as measured by Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s pre and post assessment tools</p>


<p>â€¢	There will be a 75% increase in the knowledge of college navigation including, but not limited to: FAFSA, college applications, college choices and majors, etc.- as measured by Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s pre and post assessment tools</p>


<p>â€¢	25% of high school seniors under project will graduate and earn their high school diploma- as measured by Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s educational data collection</p>


<p>â€¢	Increase the passing of CAHSEEâ€™s (California High School Exit Exams) by 20%- as measured by Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s educational data collection</p><p>â€¢	100% increase in knowledge of college preparation (FAFSA, college applications, college navigation, etc.)- using Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s pre and post-assessment tools</p>

<p>â€¢	85% increase in confidence levels within their education- using Collaborative Tutoringâ€™s pre and post-assessment tools</p>


<p>â€¢	100% increase in knowledge and access to resources</p>","Mentoring through Education will benefit LA by providing innovative, hands-on, and experiential educational services and workshops, with the development of Learning Communities. We expect over 300 students to be served throughout Los Angeles County in high-crime, high poverty communities over the course of the project. However, through the implementation of Learning Communities, the number of individuals served throughout Los Angeles will multiply drastically.  Through these teaching communities, LA will benefit by creating more jobs, decreasing unemployment rates, improving the health of LA residents, creating safe environments for residents to live, and inspiring residents to educate their children at a very young age. 





Mentoring has shown to positively impact the lives of youth all over the world. It has inspired young people to face and overcome obstacles within their lives. Through the Mentoring through Education Movement, this project will revolutionize the way of learning, allowing young people to have a support system as they progress through not only their educational goals, but their lives.  





Through our embedded mentoring, community service, and restorative justice approach, we expect LA to benefit from our young leaders who are succeeding and giving back to their communities. By fostering young leaders to reach their goals and succeed in their lives, we expect the same individuals to model and inspire other young people to become future leaders. 





Collaborative Tutoring envisions the increase in high school diploma attainment rates within the Los Angeles County. With this, we expect that college-going rates will increase. It is our goal to build up young leaders that will pave the way for their own children and embed education within their childrenâ€™s lives. 


","<p>We expect success to look like â€œA Culturally Diverse and Educated LA,â€ while working together to positively impact and educate young individuals and communities through a mentoring movement. To succeed on oneâ€™s own may be difficult, but with the support and guidance of one or more mentors, success can be limitless. We envision collaboration among our young people, their families, and communities to promote, practice, and model the Mentoring through Education Movement throughout their lives and future generations. </p>





<p>Success in the year 2050, will be apparent through a significant rise in educational vitality and a major decrease in recidivism rates among our young people. This will be reflective when our young leaders are leading through modeling and actively creating positive impact within their communities. With mentoring embedded as a way of learning, success will demonstrate â€œthe young teaching the young.â€ </p>





<p>Education will no longer be a significant impediment to human development, but be the pathway for our young adults of today to succeed and lead; as future educated business owners, teachers, parents, and collaborators. Education will also be the driving force that significantly positively affects all other indicators that impede human development, including: arts and cultural vitality, environmental quality, health, housing, income and employment, public safety, and social connectedness. </p>





<p>Race, income, and geography will no longer have to dictate how we live and experience Los Angeles. Through the Mentoring through Education Movement, the people that make up Los Angeles will be able to have a choice on their success and how they live their lives. 


Nelson Mandela once said, â€œEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.â€ Education in 2050, will not only change the world, but will change lives. LA in 2050 is a story of HOPE.</p>

3102051,2013051,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/iamcollegetrack.html,College Track: Creating a Pathway to College in Boyle Heights, Education,"In this country, there exists a persistent gap between the academic achievements of low income, predominantly African American and Latino students and their high income, white peers. In California, less than 16% of students of color graduate from high school with the required classes to attend a University of California or California State University campus. On a nation wide scale, only 22% of lowincome students earn a bachelors degree within 6 years of high school. Students are not getting the support necessary to navigate the college landscape to college completion. We aim to provide this support.








College Track is a national educational nonprofit organization working to increase high school graduation, college enrollment, and college graduation rates among lowincome students. Our ultimate goal is to transform communitiesâ€”like Boyle Heights, where our Los Angeles center is locatedâ€”into places where all students have the opportunity to graduate from a 4year university. We do this by opening College Track centersâ€”centrally located in communities demonstrating significant needâ€”where our students receive academic and college readiness support in a learning â€˜hubâ€™ environment. Through this work we narrow the achievement gap and build collegegoing cultures in the neighborhoods where our centers are located. Currently, the organization supports more than 1,400 students at centers in East Palo Alto, Oakland, San Francisco, New Orleans, Aurora, Colorado, and now Los Angeles.








College Track strongly believes that if you give motivated students the resources and tools to succeed, they will. College Track was founded by volunteer counselors who discovered that many students were motivated enough, but lacked resources to access college. College Track helps students with their academics, coaches them through the required tests, prepares them for the culture of higher education, supports them through the application process, and mentors them throughout college. These are kids who have the will to succeed, but lack the support to be successful. We provide them with that support, so that they in turn can reach their goals.








The student who is accepted into the College Track program receives academic and mentoring support for up to ten years, starting in their freshman year of high school through their college graduation. There is no other program like this in the country. College Track students currently attend more than 75 fouryear institutions including Harvard, Stanford, MIT, University of California (Berkeley, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Cruz), Howard University, Spelman College, and Columbia. 








Programming consists of:





Our Academic Summer Advancement Program prepares rising 9th graders for the challenges of high school. 








Academic Affairs provides comprehensive academic planning, tutoring, 


monitoring and support. 








Student Life provides students with opportunities to explore their passions and engage in their communities. 








College Affairs guides students in all aspects of college admissions and support with scholarships. 








College Success supports students once they are in college, through advising, financial assistance, and social engagement.








Over the course of four years, students receive support equivalent to one extra year of high school.








At the suggestion of Mayor Villaraigosa and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Deasy, and given the scarcity of educational support in the neighborhood, College Track began an expansion of its services to Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles this school year. The students here deeply need and deserve a safe space with caring and nurturing adults who help them with their high school academics, prepare them for the culture of higher education, support them through the college and scholarship applications, and mentor them all through their college years. 








College Track is partnering with two of the small schools affiliated with Roosevelt Senior High School in Boyle Heights â€“ The Academy of Medical and Health Sciences, and the Math Science & Technology Magnet Academy. College Track is colocated on the Roosevelt campus for our inaugural year and has plans to expand off site as our program grows.   Our first class is comprised of 30 freshmen from each of these Academies, for a total of 60 students. We will continue to grow the center by adding an additional cohort of 60 freshmen a year. By 201516, our Boyle Heights center will be fully enrolled with four cohorts of students, totaling roughly 240.








College Track strongly believes that neighborhoods and schools must work more effectively together to support the healthy development of youth. College Track and its partners have the opportunity to radically improve the academic and life outcomes for students in Boyle Heights.


","College Track's program and services are linked to a proven model of college preparation and completion. Today, our national strategy stems from sixteen years of outstanding program results: 100% percent of our seniors graduate high school, compared to an average of 50% in the districts we serve, 90% are admitted to a fouryear college, compared to roughly 15% of students of the same demographic, 80% of students who complete our high school program have graduated from, or are still attending college. Over time, College Track increases the number of collegebound students of color in each community we serve. College Track students are often the first in their families to attend college, and with this example, their families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers adopt a mindset that a college degree is the expectation, not the exception. ","College Track is partnering with two of the small schools affiliated with Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights  The Academy of Medical & Health Sciences, and the Math Science & Technology Magnet Academy. Our first class is comprised of 30 students from each of these Academies. Boyle Heights native Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas is supporting College Track philanthropically, and by launching the Peapod Music & Arts Academy, which provides instruction in performing arts. Other partners inclide Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the California Endowment, and collaborations with several CBOs including the Boyle Heights Learning Collaborative, Homeboy Industries, and Proyecto Pastoral, creating a strong community base to support out work.","College Trackâ€™s primary measure of impact is graduation rates. We track studentsâ€™ college status and progress through college graduation and compare results to national and regional averages for similar demographics of students. College Track has the following primary goals for impact: 1) 75% program retention; 2) 100% of our students graduate high school; 3) 90% matriculate into fouryear college programs; 4) 75% graduate from college in six or more years.





In Boyle Heights over the coming year, we expect the following:


â€¢	College Track will double students served from 60 to 120.


â€¢	Via our math support program, 55% of students will meet the math readiness benchmark on the ACT predictor test in 201314, compared to 38% of students during 201213. 


â€¢	Via our Academic Affairs Program, 70% of students will earn a GPA of 2.75 or higher in 201314 (minimum GPA required to be eligible for a California State University), compared to 55% of students in 201213. 


â€¢	We will retain 90% of students.





In order to achieve our goals, staff monitors all students closely to ensure individual program goals are completed and that challenges students encounter do not go unaddressed.  Indicators used to track student success include daily attendance, academic performance, and test scores. Additionally, college application indicators, such as application deadlines, completion, admission, and scholarships awarded, are also monitored by College Track staff, as well as leadership and extracurricular interests, and community service hours. College Track's Director of Program Evaluation and Planning, designs and monitors a set of tracking tools that measure organizational performance based on the stated expectations for scholar achievement and attendance. Progress is measured on an ongoing basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, by semester, and annually.)


","Only onethird of Boyle Heights residents 25 yearsold or older have a high school diploma, and only 5% of these residents have a college degree. Additionally, close to 50% of students from Boyle Heights never complete high school. On a host of academic measures, schools in Boyle Heights have historically been very low performing. In 2010, 41% of Roosevelt High School students graduated high school in four years, and only 22% of those graduates were eligible to attend a fouryear university. At Hollenbeck Middle School, only 6% of 8th grade students scored proficient or advanced in math and 19% in English language arts (ELA). At Roosevelt High School, only 5% of students are proficient or advanced in math and 26% in ELA. We intend to change all of this.








College Track's services are linked to a proven model of college preparation and success. Over the past 16 years, 100% percent of our seniors graduate high school compared to an average of 50% in the districts we serve, over 90% are admitted to a fouryear school compared to roughly 15% of students of the same demographic, and 80% of students who completed our high school program have graduated from, or are still attending college. 








Over time, CT increases the number of college bound students of color in each of the districts and cities we serve. For example, in 2008 when we opened our center in San Franciscoâ€™s Bayview Hunterâ€™s Point neighborhood, only 6 AfricanAmerican students graduated from the neighborhood high school eligible to attend a 4year university. Since graduating our first class in San Francisco in 2012, we have sent 120 students to college from the Bayview, and we are poised to increase the San Francisco Unified School Districtâ€™s college bound AfricanAmerican students by 30% by 2016. We expect to see similar results and impact for our Boyle Heights center.








Specifically, this work will benefit Los Angeles by:





1) Positively impacting academic outcomes for Boyle Heights, Roosevelt High School, and in time, the LAUSD.








2) Creating a pathway to college for underprivileged students in Boyle Heights who would not have the opportunity to pursue a 4year degree were it not for our support. 








3) Transforming Boyle Heights into a community where it is the expectation, not the exception, for students to pursue and obtain a 4year degree.








4) Contributing to the economic vitality of the city, by creating a strong, educated work force in one of the cityâ€™s most vulnerable neighborhoods.  





 


","â€œWe need to see more College Tracks. Ideally Iâ€™d want to live in a world where we wouldnâ€™t need College Track, where every student would be going to college. But we do need College Track, and just one center was not enough,â€ David Cruz, Class of 2004. 








By 2050, we will work in a world where there would not need to be College Track. By 2050, we will have provided direct impact to lowincome students across Los Angeles, and nationwide. These communities will be transformed, and college will be the norm. We will continue to work in collaboration with KIPP, Teach for America, Posse, and others to determine best practices and develop a pipeline for getting underprivileged students in Los Angeles through college.  Our city will value the mindset and resources needed to do this, and will adopt and support these practices. By 2050, all students in Los Angeles will have the tools, role models, support and resources to complete college and pursue their dreams. This in turn will contribute to a thriving, healthy Los Angeles, where the skills, tools, and gifts of each of its residents are recognized and valued.

3102052,2013052,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CBEYouthEJ.html,Youth for Environmental Justice and Community Revitalization, Environmental Quality,"Low income communities of color are disproportionately impacted by cumulative sources of pollution and poor land use decisions.  The only way these disparities can be seriously addressed is for wellinformed community members to engage in the decisionmaking process.  Our idea is to build a generation of civic leaders that will work with different stakeholders to transform their communities and their neighborhoods toward more sustainable and livable environments.  In this project we propose to offer a wide range of leadership development and technical trainings related to civic engagement and environmental stewardship.  These trainings will build the capacity of a dedicated group of youth activists, leaders and future decisionmakers in Southeast Los Angeles County and in the Harbor areawhich is host to some of the most polluted and vulnerable communities in the Los Angeles region.  Here are the activities that CBE proposes:





Leadership Development Trainings:  Youth will complete an intensive 6week, 18hour summer training. Youth will learn how and why pollution disproportionately affects lowincome communities of color (Session I); the locations of the most egregious polluting industries in their communities (Session 2); pollutionâ€™s detrimental effects on human health in their communities (Session 3); the environmental decisionmaking processes in their communities (Session 4); how community efforts can successfully stop or prevent pollution (Session 5); and how communities develop a vision for protecting and improving their environments (Session 6).  Educational and teambuilding elements of the trainings will help youth build motivation to become leaders in community environmental stewardship. 





Mono Lake Trainings:  Youth and adults will participate in intergenerational â€œParent Nightâ€ workshops on water issues and Mono Lake. Youth, with CBE staff, will participate in 5day, 4night educational field trips and trainings at Mono Lake, hosted by the Mono Lake Committee. Youth will learn to analyze the relationship between Mono Lake and the Southern California water supply, how to gather and test water samples to assess the health of water, and uses for this data. By learning about water conservation practices and about the impact of Southern California water use on Mono Lake, they will develop motivation to conserve water on individual and household levels, for example by turning off the tap while showering or brushing teeth and by using waterefficient systems to water plants.  





LA River Stewardship Training:  Youth will each attend 1.5hour LA River Stewardship workshops and one of three, 2.5hour LA River Stewardship kayaking field trips with CBE and LA River Expeditions staff. During the workshops, youth will learn about water pollution issues related to the LA River, the history of the revitalization of the upper portion of the river, and current community efforts to revitalize the lower portion. Youth will learn to analyze the relationships between mobile sources of pollution and river water quality, and between the future health of the lower portion of the river and planning for Highway I710, which runs next to it. During the postfield trip workshop, all youth will gather to compare the upper and lower LA River, to analyze the impact of river pollution on human health, to problemsolve better solutions, and to conduct a visioning process for river stewardship. 





Stormwater Pollution Trainings:  Youth will participate in one 1.5hour stormwater pollution workshops and water sampling field trips with CBE and LA Waterkeeper staff. The workshops, coled by CBE staff and LA Waterkeeper, will teach youth to think critically about industrial water pollution and how the Clean Water Act can be used to reduce it. During the field trips, youth will see and learn how industrial runoff contaminates ecological systems and affects the health of humans and other species and will gather water samples to be evaluated for pollution levels. 


","â€¢	Working with adult and youth members in refinery communities to achieve precedentsetting standards to prevent chemical leaks from thousands of valves at oil refineries and mandating vapor controls on refinery tankers loading in California. This historic regulation is now a national standard. 





â€¢	Working with adult and youth members to significantly strengthen the California South Coast Air Quality Management Districtâ€™s Rule 1402 to reduce allowable cancer risks from air pollution from stationary sources of pollution by 75%. 





â€¢	Working with adult and youth members in refinery communities in California to achieve the nationâ€™s most stringent regulations of â€œflaring,â€ or burning of excess gases by refineries, at both the Bay Area and South Coast Air Quality Management Districts, now a national working model that can be put in place at all refineries. In the South Coast air shed alone, by December of 2012, this regulation has achieved an estimated reduction of 1.18 tons per day of SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and 1.44 tons per day of CO2 (carbon dioxide). 





â€¢	Working in intergenerational settings to lead a successful campaign against construction of an unneeded and highlypolluting power plant in the City of Vernon, California. This prevented an annual emission of 1.8 million pounds of local and regional pollution and 5.5 billion pounds of greenhouse gases from entering the environment. It also created regional awareness about health impacts of pollution, energy planning, and contributed to exposing corruption in Vernonâ€™s city governance.   





â€¢	Working with Youth members to defeat an unnecessary polluting power plant proposal in the City of South Gate, California.  This campaign is analyzed in Power Politics, a book written by UCLA social anthropologist, Karen Bodkin.





â€¢	Working with youth and adult members along the Long Beach Freeway (I710) corridor and in coalition with other environmental and community groups to create an unprecedented public participation framework in the I710 freeway expansion project led by Caltrans and Metro. We used this strategic opportunity to elevate community demands for a cleaner, healthier project. 





â€¢	Working with youth and adult members, allies and academic partners to introduce a novel policy initiative in the City of Los Angeles called Clean Up Green Up to address cumulative impacts from multiple pollution sources and environmental health and justice concerns in city planning. Relying on participatory action research methods and engaging community members in the Wilmington area from the early phases of policy formulation, CBE staff and community members engaged with experts, allies, city councilmembers and the Mayorâ€™s office to win their support for this policy. 





â€¢	Building one of the most successful and vibrant environmental justice youth programs in the country during the past 15 years in Southeast Los Angeles County.


","â€¢	Mono Lake Committee


â€¢	LA River Expeditions 


â€¢	Los Angeles Waterkeeper","Evaluation strategies and tools will include, at a minimum: (a) plus/delta evaluations of all meetings, trainings, activities, recorded on butcher paper during the meeting, then transcribed into electronic format;  (b) pre and postsurveys for selected attitudes, knowledge and skills; (c) results of pre and postsurveys conducted by Mono Lake Committee for youth members who participate in Mono Lake field trips; (d) monitoring of quarterly staff work plans by supervisors to ensure that satisfactory progress is being made on project elements; and (d) endofyear evaluations in December/January of each year.","Environmental justice communities are at the fenceline of polluting sources.  Creating greener and cleaner operations at the fenceline neighborhoods and improving landuse decisions in vulnerable communities will not only promote the public health of residents most in need but also benefit the entire LA region.  Addressing environmental equity for communities that have traditionally been neglected due to gaps in proper permitting, enforcement and planning will create great environmental benefits to the most susceptible LA communities by way of improved air quality, reduction of water pollution, enhanced access to open space, revitalization of blighted lands, greater access to healthy food options, greater community cohesion and overall improvement of quality of life.  





These benefits will not be limited to the areas that will be receiving direct attention. They will have a positive impact on all of the residents in the region by reducing pollution and spurring economic growth regionally.  Working with businesses with industrial operations in environmental justice communities to better manage their storm water runoff will protect our waterways and the Pacific Ocean. Pushing for zero emission technologies during the expansion of goodsmovement operations near Wilmington and along the I710 corridor will benefit all communities in Los Angeles.   Prioritizing green jobs and clean energy sources in lowincome neighborhoods will benefit all LA residents and our planet by way of reducing our regionâ€™s carbon footprint. We believe the main component of improving the quality of life for vulnerable communities is enhancing civic engagement of local residents in these communities, and this project is focused on this effort.","We hope that in 2050, environmental justice communities will rank high in a wide range of sustainability indicators. Clean water, clean air, safe streets for walking and biking, an improved public transportation system, revitalized brownfields, more open/green space, more access to healthy food outlets and nutrition,  more engaged communities, and more accountable decisionmakers will be the indicators that will demonstrate significant improvements in the current disparities in environmental justice communities.

3102053,2013053,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/cislosangeles.html,Communities In Schools of Los Angeles: A Vision of 100% Graduation in LAUSD, Education,"<p>At Communities In Schools of Los Angeles, our vision is 100% high school graduation. The current graduation rate for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is 64.2%, and among Latino and African American students itâ€™s just 60% and 57% respectively. As the LA2050 report highlights, more than 20,000 Angelenos are entering our economy every year without a high school diploma. </p>





<p>Communities In Schools (CIS) is the nation's leading high school dropout prevention organization. Working nationally with 1.25 million students in 27 states, CIS is the only organization proven to increase graduation rates and decrease dropout rates in the schools in which they serve. Since its founding in 2007, CIS of Los Angeles has grown to serve over 16,000 lowincome and minority students and families at 12 traditional, Title 1 public schools across LAUSD, with 2,300 students receiving individual case management. </p>





<p>A 2011 study by Robert Balfanz at Johns Hopkins University found that students who are most atrisk of dropping out of high school can be identified as early as 6th grade through three Early Warning Indicators (EWIâ€™s): poor attendance, unsatisfactory behavior and course failure. These students have an 80% chance of dropping out and only a 1020% chance of graduating from high school. </p>





<p>CIS of Los Angeles places Site Coordinators,  passionate and extensively trained social workers and counselors, directly into the districtâ€™s highest need middle and high schools to support both individualstudent as well as schoolwide needs. Site Coordinators act as case managers, using the above mentioned EWIâ€™s to identify underserved students most atrisk of dropping out, and connecting them with strategic partners to provide interventions which specifically address those students' unmet needs. CIS then follows up to make sure those services are getting students back on track to an ontime graduation.  CIS Site Coordinators work before, during and after school, in teams of two to four, case managing up to 33% of the student body population at a site.  </p>





<p>In addition to oneonone case management, Site Coordinators work with school leadership to identify a school's biggest needs and develop a site plan outlining specific schoolwide goals, including increasing overall attendance, reducing disciplinary incidents, or strengthening the collegegoing culture. Based on these goals, CIS Site Teams develop schoolwide activities such as attendance initiatives, college & career fairs, behavior incentive programs and personal & professional development workshops. Parent engagement opportunities are also offered throughout the year, such as workshops about conducting effective parentteacher conferences.</p>





<p>Because 37.5% of dropouts happen in 9th grade, CIS has developed targeted initiatives for students in their freshman year, such as workshops on study skills and time management during this time of transition. At many of our schools, CIS partners with City Year for report card conferencing, during which trained, volunteer adult mentors meet with every single 9th grader for oneonone assistance reviewing their report cards. These adults provide students with encouragement and advice, in addition to practical tools for initiating effective conversations with their teachers and improving their grades.  </p>





<p>CISâ€™s work is guided by the Five Basics, a set of essentials every student needs and deserves: a oneonone relationship with a caring adult;  a safe place to learn and grow; a healthy start and a healthy future;, a marketable skill to use upon graduation; and a chance to give back to peers and community. This means that though CIS of Los Angeles will most directly impact LA2050â€™s Education indicator, our work also indirectly impacts the other indicators, including: Income & Employment, Health, Public Safety and Social Connectedness. </p>





<p>As Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said, â€œThe path to the middle class today runs straight through the classroom.â€ The healthy and prosperous future of Los Angeles depends on improving our cityâ€™s graduation rates until 100% of our students receive a high school diploma.</p>","<p>Since starting our program at Venice and Hamilton High Schools in 2007, schoolwide graduation rates have risen 9.8% and 12.4% respectively, with leadership reporting a stronger collegegoing culture at both schools.  This despite massive budget cuts resulting in the loss of personnel at both schools, including teachers, college counselors, Title 1 Coordinators, Pupil Services & Attendance (PSA) counselors and school psychologists. </p>





<p>At Hollenbeck Middle School, the API score has risen 80 points in the past four years with CIS on campus, the greatest increase among any of the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools in Boyle Heights, and the only one partnered with CIS. </p>





<p>Though we are facing a local and national dropout crisis, CISâ€™s approach of providing integrated student support services directly inside public schools has proven to be a successful intervention. Despite originally exhibiting risk factors, 96% of CIS of Los Angeles seniors graduated in June 2012 compared to the district's 62% graduation rate. 84% of CIS of Los Angeles students met their attendance goals, 81% met their academic achievement goals, and 84% met their behavior improvement goals.</p>","<p>CIS establishes strategic partnerships with school leadership, communitybased organizations, social services agencies, health care providers and parent and volunteer organizations to provide students with interventions that address their unmet needs.  </p>

<p>Spark</p>","<p>CIS of Los Angeles is a data driven organization, committed to the rigorous measurement and monitoring of outcomes. We track students' attendance, behavior and academic marks every five weeks, in addition to annual graduation, culmination and grade promotion rates. We have also begun to collect longitudinal progression data to track individual students within our feeder patterns, with the longerterm aim of evaluating the impact of our program on every student as they progress from 6th12th grade. </p>





<p>Data is entered directly into a national data management system and is analyzed by our Data Manager at the end of every semester, generating a comprehensive report of individual site and affiliatewide progress. In the yearend report, we also utilize schoolwide performance indicators â€“ such as graduation and promotion rates, attendance rates, API scores and other metrics â€“ to run comparative analyses on the strength of our programs and to evaluate CISâ€™ overall impact on a school community.</p>





<p>Ultimately, success is defined as a 100% graduation rate in the schools we serve. As we work to approach this 100%, we evaluate the success of our individual sites and our entire affiliate through annual benchmarks. These benchmarks are unique to each school and are determined by the abovementioned student data. Individual students are considered successful if they graduate or promote to the next grade level, attend school more than 96% of the time, receive fewer than 2 unsatisfactory behavior marks on their report card and receive no F's on their report card. CIS benchmarks increase year by year at each school, as students continue to meet their goals. </p>





<p>Our Executive Director and Board of Directors use all of the above data to evaluate, guide and finetune the work we do with all of our students at all of our school sites. Two major questions inform our refinements: 1) Are 100% of our students considered successful by the above metrics? And 2) Has CIS positively addressed a schoolâ€™s greatest needs in order to increase the graduation rate?</p>","In 2012, Communities In Schools commissioned a national economic impact study to quantify its economic and social returns to society through a rigorous thirdparty investment analysis. Conducted by EMSI, one of the nationâ€™s leading economic modeling firms, the study found that every dollar invested in Communities In Schools of Los Angeles generates $38.00 in economic benefit for the community. Students who earn a high school diploma have been shown to earn over $300,000 more over the course of their lifetime than peers who drop out. Businesses benefit by having a more skilled and productive workforce, taxpayers benefit through a broadening tax base, and the public generally benefits from reduced social costs attributed to dropping out of high school, such as crime and unemployment. Despite LAUSDâ€™s 64.2% graduation rate, in 2012 96% of CIS of Los Angeles students graduated ontime from high school. The benefits to our community are much more than merely subjective. What does all of this mean?  A $100,000 grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation through LA2050 would result in $3,800,000 in economic benefits to Los Angeles.  


","<p>Success in 2050 would be a 100% graduation rate for students in LAUSD, achieved through the modification of the fundamental way in which resources are delivered to schools and families in Los Angeles. Every student would have access to coordinated, accountable, personalized assistance through a Site Coordinator, whose first responsibility would be to know the name of every student who might be at risk of dropping out. Community resources would be brought inside the system to provide a safety net of wraparound services for students and families.</p>





<p>As CIS founder, Bill Milliken, has written, â€œScalability, sustainability, and evidencebased strategies are essential to creating permanent change in the way our education system combat the dropout epidemic.â€ The CIS model of placing a trained professional adult directly onto school campus fulltime to act as a broker of community resources to students is a fully scalable approach to meeting the districtâ€™s goal of 100% graduation for all students. </p>"
3102054,2013054,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/PTP.html,Peace to Prosperity, Public Safety,"CIS has been in the business of improving public safety for over 19 years. As a world champion in martial arts and kickboxing, CIS Executive Director, Blinky Rodriguez has a long history of working with youth. The work became personal in 1990 when Blinky himself fell victim to gang violence. Sonny, his 16yearold son was killed in a driveby shooting. In court, Blinky met the three killers facetoface, not for retribution, but to forgive them. Through a series of meetings, he subsequently negotiated a truce, called The Valley Unity Peace Treaty, which was signed by over 75 gangs with over 1,000 members. The treaty successfully reduced gangrelated deaths from 62 to 2 in the first year. The peace treaty project became CIS San Fernando Valley, a nonprofit organization in 1994. Blinky approached longtime friend Bobby Arias, then Southwest Regional Director for Communities In Schools, Inc. and solicited his assistance in developing an â€œintegrated service delivery approachâ€ for gang youth. Since the tragedy of Sonnyâ€™s death, Blinky and Bobby have dedicated their lives to improve and promote public safety by ending youth and gang violence and helping young people transform their lives.





CIS is one of the first organizations in LA to deliver services exclusively to ganginvolved and gangoriented youth and young adults within a cohesive, integrated, wraparound service delivery strategy aimed at addressing root causes. These wraparound services integrate violence prevention, gang intervention, parenting, mentoring, intensive case management, recreation/sports, therapeutic/mental health counseling, life skills and job development based on the individual needs of each client. A critical element within our model is engaging clients in sporting events. These sporting events displace hostility and violence and have proven to be some of the most effective CIS communal public safety intervention activities. They lead to improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility.





The idea we propose to LA2050 to improve public safety is our â€œCIS GAMES FOR PEACEâ€. The goal of CIS GAMES FOR PEACE is to showcase how CIS can prevent violence through well designed and coordinated sporting events. For example, a flag football game back in 1993 between rival gang members was the pivotal event that helped CIS solidify the historic Valley Unity Peace Treaty. This was a groundbreaking, paradigm busting, first of its kind phenomenon in the realm of peacekeeping in LA. That original football game morphed into a world renowned blueprint for peace acknowledged by the United Nations. CIS has since then conducted 252 sporting events that bring together potential enemies, reduce friction, encourages harmonious communication and prevent violence. 


 


Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE would include a series of basketball, handball, softball and football events. We will conduct a minimum of 25 events each year partnering with Dept. of Recreation & Parks, LAPD and other law enforcement agencies and elected officials to ensure ongoing community safety.


 


In addition, we would make boxing instruction available to this underserved population through our CIS Heart of Champions Boxing Academy. This instruction would take place at a local boxing gym where participants will receive professional boxing instruction. The Academy will provide a positive alternative to gang life for participants and significantly enhance their health, physical fitness and abilities, sense of pride, selfworth, cooperativeness and respect for others. We believe that participation in this program will have profound impact on our youth. Academy youth will be required to take our anger management/mediation class as a prerequisite to participate in the academy. The curriculum will consist of beginning boxing and kickboxing principles. Those who wish will be allowed to participate in the Golden Gloves program facilitated by the gym. The program will provided participants with a Heart of Champions membership, Tshirt, mouthpiece and hand wraps.





We feel this idea will impact public safety by reducing crime and while also improving health. Crime rates are at historic lows throughout the county. Still, the experience of crime and perceptions of safety vary widely along racial and socioeconomic lines. Areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher rates of violent crime. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will be engaged in positive activities and away from crime. As noted by LA2050, safety and security is â€œa core element for the wellbeing of individuals and society as a whole.â€2Crime can lead to loss of life and property; it has detrimental physical and mental health consequences; it can reduce economic productivity; and, most detrimentally, it creates a pervasive feeling of vulnerability. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will have ready access to mobile health screening and other services.","Numerous national and international leaders including Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Dr. Jane Goodall, Al Gore and Barbara Boxer have recognized the work of Blinky and CIS. CIS violence prevention and intervention practices have been replicated in the USA, Germany, Tanzania, England and South Africa. In 1998, Blinky received the Medaille dâ€™Excellence, presented in Switzerland to only 14 people worldwide in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the United Nationâ€™s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Blinky has earned over eightythree awards for his work. He was selected by LA Mayor James Hahn, A&E Television and their Biography series as a 2002 Biography Community Hero for his service to LA. Blinky and the staff of CIS were featured in the November 2002 Reader's Digest article on ""Everyday Heroes"". In 2003, he received the Angel of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater LA, The SFV Interfaith Council Human Relations Award, Simon Bolivar Liberty Award and was appointed by Mayor Hahn to The Commission for Children, Youth & Their Families. The following is a sample of our achievements:


 


Helped reduce gangrelated deaths from 62 to 2 in one year


Connected over 1300 youths with mentors  


Helped place 554 people in jobs


Helped place 220 people in college


Conducted over 252 Sports Events with over 11,000 participants


Conducted over 106 Peace Rallies/Community Events with over 50,000 attendees





The Public Safety and peacekeeping efforts of CIS were the subject of a 1999 study, funded by the California State Legislature under AB 2650. Conducted by Cal State University at Northridge, it found the peace treaty to be effective in demonstrating peacekeeping strategies and recommended that it be replicated statewide. CIS has been named the â€œmodelâ€ program for gang intervention by the State of California, LA County and the City of LA.





A most significant achievement occurred in 2012. After a journey that exceeded eleven years, CIS celebrated the grand opening of our Job Training & Opportunity Center on October 22, 2012. The Center has been a dream since 2001 when CIS first realized the positive impact that having a job had on helping youth continue their education and avoid violence. The Centerâ€™s construction was funded by a partnership between the County of Los Angeles, the City of Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and the U. S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Center represents an unprecedented joint partnership between CIS and LA County Probation. Under a tenyear rentfree lease, the brand new CIS Job Training & Opportunity Center sits on County land and houses job training, educational and other support services programs. County Probation officers share the facility with CIS to serve probationary youth, dropouts and their families. CIS will maximize the Probation partnership and relationships to ensure job readiness service delivery for participants is effective, well coordinated and well managed.


","Partners will be LAPD, United Methodist Church, USC, UCLA, CSUN, Mission College and xx Boxing Gym. CIS now uses the church gym to provide services to gang members in a safe setting who otherwise would not be able to congregate because of LAPD gang injunctions. Activities include basketball tournaments for youth, zumba classes and self improvement workshops for mothers and swap meets for community bargain hunting at the site. USC, UCLA, CSUN and Cal State LA will provide interns as mentors/tutors for gang youth. Mission College will provide job training, job placement, GED and other educational services.","CIS has successfully demonstrated that it can deliver results. CIS became the subject of a study, funded in 1999 by the California State Legislature conducted by Cal State University at Northridge. Over 1,200 people were interviewed during the CSUN evaluation. Among the interviewees were kids, gang members, teachers, probation officers, parents, police officers and local citizens. The following is a sample of the responses:





â€¢	â€œThey (CIS) are there day and night; any timeâ€¦itâ€™s had a tremendous positive impact.â€


â€¢	â€œFor them (the youth) to be part of the program, it makes them feel wanted, loved and understood. It makes the community feel more trust.â€


â€¢	â€œNow, you donâ€™t have to worry as much. You can feel comfortable in the park. People have birthday parties in the parks now. You couldnâ€™t do that beforenot and feel safe.â€


â€¢	â€œCIS teaches kids how to work their way up. It gives them selfconfidence to get a job, teaches them about expectation on the job, teaches them how to make a living and has helped kids get jobs, especially through Local 300.â€





More recently a five year evaluation of CIS conducted by one of the nationâ€™s foremost social science evaluations firms, ICF International from Fairfax Virginia, showed:





â€¢	The CIS Model yields substantive improvements in school and student level outcomes on credit completion, academics and attendance and is unique in among other dropout prevention programs in reducing dropout and increasing graduation rates.


â€¢	Students that receive CIS case management services successfully navigate the critical 6th to 9th grade transition better than those students that do not receive CIS services.


â€¢	Student outcomes were significantly better for those who received CIS casemanagement services for two and three years, rather than just one year, proving that the long term effects of sustained engagement with CIS were substantial.


â€¢	The greatest outcomes for schools and students resulted from CISâ€™s strong business practices, strong CIS leadership and strong school administration and teacher participation.


â€¢	the CIS Model resulted in the strongest reduction in dropout rates of over 1600 existing fully scaled dropout prevention program evaluated by ICF





CIS was evaluated over three years (20052008) by Dr. Jorja Leap, PH.D. and a team from the Department of Social Welfare at the UCLA School of Public Policy funded by the California Wellness Foundation. It showed â€œCIS has demonstrated substantive impact on the lives of the youth it works to serve.  Further, the program has shown to be a steadying force in their lives as well as a source of support in a community that has few such resources available to its families.â€ Under LA2050, we will have specialized data collected and analyzed by another UCLA team. This evaluation team will write a comprehensive analysis of the results and the report will assess the effectiveness of our work; analyze Process data, numbers of clients, units of service and evidence of intended outcomes.


","Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE project would benefit Los Angeles in a number of ways. Specifically, our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE participants come from communities with some of the lowest income and high crime areas in Los Angelesâ€™ San Fernando Valley. They face a relentless assault of negative influences that often result in drug abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, poor academic performance, even death. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will develop the skills, abilities, relationships and associations necessary to foster selfesteem, persistence, perseverance and positive attitudes to overcome negative influences.





Next, the project follows evidencebased models already proven to be effective. Two significant studies, Yin (1986) and Spergel (1989) evaluated strategies typically used to deal with gangs and delinquency. Both studies found that the most effective were:





â€¢	Community Organization comprehensive interagency cooperation and community cohesion among grass roots organizations, law enforcement agencies along with job development 





â€¢	Providing Alternative Opportunitiesother activities such as sports, recreation, youth service, job training and placement





CIS services and our Wraparound service delivery strategy are in line with the â€œSpergel Modelâ€ and incorporate all elements of the model. 





Our special connection with youth and sports has been long, consistent and one of the most highly successful elements of the public safety methodology. The 252 baseball, softball, football, basketball and soccer games and tournaments that CIS has conducted have been highly effective tools in enhancing communication, reducing violence and improving the quality of life for all members of the community. The LA Times February 20, 1994 praised the football game that marked the 110th day of the Valley Unity Peace Treaty. Since then, scores of newspaper articles have documented the importance of these sporting events in helping youth avoid gangs and violence. In 2004, CIS hosted the first ever softball game between LA County Probation Gang Unit Officers and former/current gang members to enhance communication and improve relationships. In August 2005, CIS in partnership with the LAPD, hosted the 5th Annual LAPD Celebrity SwingAThon.





The most significant and fundamental benefit to LA is that youth and individuals formally considered as â€œthrowawayâ€ are reenergized with hope and can contribute positively to our society. These are individuals that others have â€œgiven up onâ€ and who have been called the â€œlepersâ€ of society. They are ganginvolved or gang oriented youth and young adults who, despite their past behaviors, have demonstrated a sincere willingness to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. LA or any city and community can benefit when souls, spirits and minds are uplifted and redirected toward positive action.


","Gang Violence is a plague that potentially threatens the health of every man, woman and child throughout Los Angeles on a daily basis. Victims can be rich, poor or innocent bystanders of any race or age. You or someone you know could be exposed and afflicted at any time, either at home or away from home. This plague takes rank with other significant Public Safety issues that result in death and destruction within in our communities.





Have you ever heard a gunshot in your neighborhood, in your home? Has your child? Please stop for a minute and think about it. Close your eyes and put yourself there. We believe that in 2050 the success in Public Safety would look like a community where none of us ever has to endure that experience.





We believe we can make this vision become a reality through communal public safety intervention activities that will ultimately lead to improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility.





Between 2007 and 2008, US Congressman Tony Cardenas, (then an LA City Councilman) worked with CIS and other community stakeholders to draft public policy regarding juvenile justice, gang violence and other public safety issues. The result was a CommunityBased Gang Intervention Model that provides a blueprint for the infrastructure to adequately understand gang intervention and create the appropriate mechanisms and systems to support and expand the field of gang intervention. The Model combines proactive and reactive approaches to improve the quality of life of communities through reducing violence and providing integrated human services.





Communitybased gang intervention provides specialized crisis intervention as well as ongoing attention and maintenance by skilled intervention specialists who have personal knowledge, understanding, and experience of gang life and thereby offer the greatest likelihood for gaining, building, and maintaining trust and confidence among active and former gang members. 





This twoprong approach provides hardcore, specialized, streetbased mediation and mitigation to stop or prevent violence between gangs and the concurrent redirection of individual gang members and their families in ways that bring progress to themselves and their communities.


Prong 1 is Hardcore, Specialized Street and Detention/PrisonBased Services that provide for the deployment of peacemakers on the streets, saving lives by quelling rumors, preventing and mediating conflicts, and responding to crises. Prong 2 is GangResponsive/Specific Individual & Family Services that deliver rehabilitative services to ganginvolved and affiliated individuals, families, and communities. 





CIS is a communitybased organization that is in the business of saving lives. Our work using the twoprong Model results in enhanced public safety rather than fear and apprehension, an environment of support rather than rejection and a new population of young people reenergized with selfconfidence, selfesteem and future."

While crime is at record lows, there are many communities with concentrated poverty that continue to face higher levels of crime higher than wealthier parts of our city. This disparity falls along race and class lines, undermining the promise of equality in our great city and threatening our future vitality.</p>





<p>Our idea is simple.  In areas with concentrated poverty, transform public spaces, which are traditionally danger zones â€“ such as parks and schools â€“ into community nerve centers for developing leaders, addressing public safety, and creating transformative social change.   By organizing residents to reclaim public spaces, communities begin to transform their neighborhood, their relationships to each other, and are primed for increased civic engagement.</p>





<p>Previous Success 


Since 2008, Community Coalition has employed this strategy in the King Estates neighborhood of South Los Angeles. Residents identified Martin Luther King Jr. Park and the adjacent public library as a hub for change.</p>





<p>For many years, residents were afraid of using the park, and were concerned about the neighboring liquor store, recycling center, and blighted alley as a barrier to the usage of the park and library. Burglaries, assaults, theft, prostitution, and homicides were also of grave concern to the residents.</p>





<p>Community Coalition recruited residents to develop solutions.  The community residents felt that to turn the violence and crime around in their neighborhood it would take an all hands on deck strategy.  As a result they pushed for various levers of change including: pressuring City officials to increase park programming, enforce its powers to stop nuisance activity at businesses (such as loitering, selling single servings of alcohol and cigarettes, allowing onsite drugdealing, etc.), and creating wrap around services and programs for young people at the park.</p>





<p>The strategy worked. Today, crime is down, and since 2008, the City has invested close to $1 million in physical improvements on what was once an ignored community.  In addition, the City of Los Angeles now runs Summer Night Lights, a summer prevention program supporting youth.  According to LAPD crime data from 20082010 crimes significantly declined after 2008.   Property crimes declined 23% in 2009, and then an additional 7% in 2010.  Violent crimes were also a significant occurrence at the park in 2008 but reduced by 23% in 2009, and an additional 3% the following year.</p>





<p>Our Proposal: Building Community through â€œEdutainmentâ€</p> 





<p>These investments and changes were not accidental.  They came as the result of organized residents coming together to make a positive change in their community.  However, not enough people know about how it happened, or that they can get involved to sustain the changes.  With the support of LA2050 we plan on changing that.</p>





<p>Last year Community Coalition organized a summer concert called the â€œSouth LA Power Festivalâ€ at King Park. Over 1000 residents attended this allday event to hear a dozen music acts and in the process Community Coalition successfully engaged hundreds of community members and provided education on the fall 2012 ballot initiatives.  The concert served as a community celebration of change and mechanism for greater resident involvement.</p>





<p>This summer and fall, Community Coalition proposes to continue reclaiming public spaces by organizing a summer art walk and fall concert to: 


1)	Promote activism as a vehicle for increasing public safety, and 


2)	Recruit residents to participate in Community Coalitionâ€™s organizing activities to increase public safety.</p>





<p>Community Coalition believes it can build community ownership, promote social connectivity, and bring public attention to successful community driven efforts by organizing mass based entertainment events that draw positive media attention and bring thousands of residents to the space.</p>





<p>With the support of LA2050, we plan to build on our success in the King Estates neighborhood by expanding our â€œSouth LA Power Festivalâ€ â€“ establishing it as a regular community function, and fortifying burgeoning community bonds.  Resources from LA2050 will allow us to more than quadruple the size of our event â€“ bringing 10,000 South L.A. residents together for a day of empowerment, entertainment, and the opportunity to connect with community leaders who are helping to transform South L.A.</p>





<p>Further, we plan to launch a new neighborhood organizing campaign in the Westmont neighborhood in South Los Angeles, utilizing the same tools we used to empower residents in King Estates. Resources from LA2050 will allow us to launch a South LA Art Walk in this community, helping to bring 1,000 residents together to build community bonds and get involved with Community Coalition public safety campaigns.</p>","<p>Community Coalition hopes to build on its major accomplishments from its 20year history to broaden the impact of its policies victories in the future. The most notable victories are in the arenas of public safety, child welfare and education:</p>





<p>Public Safety


â€¢	One of the Coalitionâ€™s first campaigns â€œRebuild South Central Without Liquor Storesâ€ led to national recognition and implementation of the Coalitionâ€™s public health model, which uses nuisance abatement and land use policy to improve public safety. After the 1992 Civil Unrest, this campaign led to the prevention of the rebuilding of over 150 liquor stores that were destroyed. Following this success, Coalition members helped author the citywide Nuisance Abatement Ordinance that was passed in 2008 with support from City Councilwoman Jan Perry. </p>





<p>Child Welfare


â€¢	In 2004, South LA relative caregivers helped Community Coalition along with Casey Family Programs, the nationâ€™s largest provider of private foster care, secure and establish a kinshipcare support center in South LA, the first ever in the region to combine services with advocacy and community organizing. Community Coalitionâ€™s Relative Caregivers have been one of the first organized and politicized constituencies in the nation to advocate around kinshipcare policies and engage elected officials around providing relative caregivers public resources. Community Coalition has won significant and important victories over the years including reaching greater parity in the amount of monthly government payments compared to their foster care counterparts. </p>





<p>Education


â€¢	The â€œEqual Access to College Prepâ€ campaign achieved the landmark AG Resolution in 2005, mandating that AG college preparatory curriculum be made available in all schools in LAUSD. Coalition youth leaders recognized that the majority of South LA youth were not on track to graduate and were ineligible for college based on college prerequirements. In this fiveyear effort, the Coalition trained student leaders to engage with elected officials and decisionmakers. The Coalition also cofounded Communities for Educ</p>","Community Coalition believes that working in collaboration with others is essential to creating social change.  Addressing public safety requires a multiprong approach that involves various stakeholders.  Community Coalition plans on building upon the alliance of organizations it involved in its organizing efforts in last years â€œPower Festival.â€  They include various organizing groups, social service providers, government representatives, businesses, labor unions, arts organizations, and advocacy groups (SCOPE, LAANE, CHIRLA, Los Angelesâ€™ Mayorâ€™s Office, Advancement Project, Parks and Recreation, Gang Reduction and Youth Development Office, SEIU ULTCW, SEIU Local 99, Voto Latino, and Brotherhood Crusade).  ","<p>As a part of the organizationâ€™s larger public safety campaign, Community Coalition will analyze real crime data (gang related incidents, property crimes, violent crimes, etc) to assess whether or not crime is declining in the Westmont and King Estates communities.   We will also use qualitative data collection through surveys and community meetings with residents to discuss if they feel safer, and identify â€œhot spotsâ€ in the community that require more attention.</p> 





<p>We anticipate involving 150 residents in various volunteer activities, outreach efforts and planning committees to organize both events. As a part of our evaluation we will assess how well we involved residents in the planning and execution of the events.  Community Coalitionâ€™s membership and leadership body, entiteled the â€œPeople Power Assemblyâ€ will be the main vehicle for community residents to help organize the events and volunteer their time.  When the event is over we will review sign in sheets, agendas, notes and hold a summary evaluation with our members to assess our success.</p>





<p>We will measure the success of the large scale entertainment events in four additional ways: 1) how many people came, 2) how many people signed up to get involved, 3) how many people actually get involved, and 4) press coverage.   With the support of LA2050 we expect to turn out close to 10,000 residents from which we will recruit 1000 new members, grow our email list by 2000, and identifying 3000 more volunteers for future activities.   It is imperative to the organization that we not only bring a lot of people out, but they stay involved.  This is quality that is built into the DNA of the organization as we believe the residents of South Los Angeles are the engine for social change. We expect people to stay involved by becoming a dues paying member, signing up for an email list, joining one of our many organizing committees, or becoming a volunteer of the organization.</p> 





<p>Press coverage will be an important factor for success.  Having the major media outlets in print, radio and TV cover the event will help to tell a different narrative about South Los Angeles and demonstrate the great work of community leaders advocating for change.</p>","Every Angeleno, regardless of class, race, or zip code should have the opportunity to live in a safe neighborhood.  Ensuring that all people have access to safe parks, streets, and violencefree neighborhoods creates a more unified and stronger Los Angeles.  However, there are communities in our city that continue to suffer from violence and higher rates of crime.  With these racial and economic disparities, we are failing as a city to ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to reach their full potential.





Organizing mass based cultural events as a part of a larger community organizing strategy to address public safety benefits Los Angeles in several ways. 





1.	Ensuring South Los Angeles has safe neighborhoods through prevention is good for everyone.  


Los Angeles benefits from advancing policies and strategies that prevent crime, rather than deter through punishment in several ways.  Everyone benefits from having less people in prison and leading positive lives.  It saves taxpayers money and allows for greater use of resources on programs that Angelinos care about like parks and recreation, youth services, and education.





By advancing community driven solutions that create safer parks, schools and libraries, we not only increase public safety, but we also tackle equity and opportunity.  More students will graduate, more families will stay in the community, and more Angelinos will take advantage of the rich history, culture, and institutions South Los Angeles offers the city.





2.	Largescale cultural events in South Los Angeles promote civic engagement. 


Just as important as the change we create, is the way in which it is created. By believing in everyday people, developing their leadership, and creating opportunities for them to work together the best and most sustainable kind of neighborhood transformation is created.   Getting people involved in the solution is a critical component to sustaining it for the long term.  We seek to ensure that residents not only come to an event but also become involved in our public safety campaigns.  Typically, events are one time in nature, and benefit the community for its set time.  By making these events a part of an ongoing organizing strategy, it moves beyond a onetime event into something meaningful throughout the year.  





3.	Brings positive attention to communities labeled as dangerous


Many communities throughout Los Angeles regularly hold entertainment events that bring thousands of residents together and help to establish a neighborhood identity, sense of pride, and build connections among attendees. Whether itâ€™s the Sunset Strip Music Festival, or others, these events serve to put these communities on the map, and engender positive associations and good will. Unfortunately, South Los Angeles is at a deficit when it comes to these types of events.  Our events will build community ownership, promote social connectivity, and bring public attention to successful community driven efforts.","<p>In 2013, Los Angeles continues to be a racially and economically segregated city.  Racial and economic disparities are a defining feature of our city.   African American and Latinos continue to have the poorest academic achievement levels, the lowest paying jobs, highest unemployment rates, live in concentrated poverty at higher rates, and live in the cityâ€™s most unsafe neighborhoods.  This is unacceptable.</p>





<p>Los Angeles has a history of valuing equity.  By 2050, we want to ensure that we practice it.  Safe neighborhoods would not just be an experience of middle class communities, but it would extend to the entire city and have a profound impact on the lives of all Angelinos.</p>





<p>Safe neighborhoods helps to eliminate achievement gap in our schools.  This means that children and teenagers would attend school without worrying about which way to walk home.  It ensures that traumatic experiences related to gun violence do not get in the way of the social and emotional development of our youth, and allows for students to focus on their academics, graduate and go onto a some form of postsecondary education.   </p>





<p>South Los Angeles has an overconcentration of unused land, blighted property and vacant lots that often serve as crime magnets and deterrents from using parks and libraries. These lands would be freed from bight and become pocket parks, youth centers, and markets with quality food and produce, and thriving businesses. </p>





<p>Families would not be afraid to use parks and libraries.  Youth would not join gangs in an effort to make money for their family or be protected from a rival gang.  Instead, youth will be involved in service learning projects, internships, and job shadowing opportunities. </p>





<p>Safe neighborhoods would mean that bars would come down from windows, gates from school sites, and security guards from shopping malls.  Neighbors would interact with one another, and children will be playing on the streets.</p>





<p>African American and Latinos in South Los Angeles will be binded together by the opportunities in front of them, rather than the obstacles and barriers created by crime that often pit them against each other, when they should be united around the conditions such as nuisance business, failing schools, vacant lots, and unemployment that foster crime in the first place.</p>





<p>In 2050, Los Angeles residents will remember the role that community residents played to reclaim their public spaces, get organized, and advance transformative change one neighborhood at a time.</p>"
3102056,2013056,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LAOpenAcres.html,LA Open Acres: Transforming Empty Space Through Collaboration and Empowerment, Environmental Quality,"<p>Many communities in Los Angeles are severely lacking in access to parks and open space. This directly impacts the quality of our environment through deteriorated air and water quality, more noise, reduced tree cover, etc. Studies have also shown that a lack of parks and open space has substantial indirect effects on public health by reducing opportunities for children and adults to participate in outdoor activities. </p>





<p>Yet, while LA is poor in parks, we are rich in vacant and underutilized lands, many of which are located in the very neighborhoods that are most in need of new parklands. The LA Open Acres Project aims to capitalize on this opportunity by facilitating the transformation of the cityâ€™s thousands of acres of vacant and underutilized lands into vibrant green, public places that contribute to the health and wellbeing of local residents.</p>





<p>Currently, these vacant, underutilized, and often abandoned empty spaces are eyesores, places for illegal dumping, and focal points for crime. Local residents who have the motivation to transform these spaces face an intimidating morass of overlapping bureaucracies and unclear ownership structures. Identifying appropriate opportunities for new green space development is extraordinarily difficult and requires a high degree of expertise. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive process in place for expanding access to open space through community participation in the assessment and stewardship of vacant land.</p>





<p>The LA Open Acres Project will break this cycle of neglect by decoding the system, creating a shared platform that neighbors can use to support each other in administrative advocacy for access to these spaces and to share expertise. </p>





<p>At the heart of the LA Open Acres Project is an online platform that provides community members with clear pathways to transforming vacant and underutilized parcels into green, open spaces. This platform will catalog and distribute information about vacant lots, alleys, red fields, surface parking lots, easements, flood control channels, and other underutilized spaces and allow neighbors and park and open space advocates to access this information in an attractive, graphical format and connect with each other to begin the process of working with the City and other landholders to develop projects. </p>





<p>The Project will begin by creating a database of these empty spaces in the City. Information will be collected using GIS data from city departments, as well as fieldwork led by community resident researchers, satellite imagery, and existing webbased mapping software. This information will inform the development of an interactive online map that allows users to identify vacant and underutilized parcels and obtain all relevant publiclyavailable data about them. Users of the website will also be able to tag and upload photos of vacant lots in their neighborhoods, allowing the data to be verified, expanded, and continually updated. Profiles of empty spaces and land parcels will include their location, size, lot number, and ownership, as well as images and any information about current efforts to organize a project around the parcel. Furthermore, users of the website will be able to find and connect with others interested in working on particular sites, and access public and private resources dedicated towards transforming them.</p>





<p>The online database and interactive map will be a powerful tool that allows neighbors, community organizations, nonprofits, neighborhood councils, and other stakeholders to work together to develop plans for converting empty spaces to places full of opportunity such as urban gardens, small parks, and other muchneeded community open space uses. The online tools will be prepared in partnership with 596 Acres, a nonprofit that is on the forefront of building online organizing platforms for land access advocates and facilitators.</p>





<p>As a key complement to the webbased tools, the LA Open Acres Project will work to translate these online resources into action on the ground, building upon the ongoing efforts of Community Health Councils and the Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles (CASLA) that CHC convenes and facilitates. This component of the Project will be adapted from 596 Acresâ€™ tactics in New York  putting signs directly on the fences of vacant municipal properties with pathways, contact information and a way for inspired passersby to connect with one another. CHC in partnership with a diverse network of advocates will connect local stakeholders with the online tools and with nonprofits and public agencies that can help them develop projects. The organized groups facilitated by the website and CHC will work in solidarity and partnership learning from each otherâ€™s challenges and successes. </p>","CHC: Since 1992 CHC has led coalitions in South LA and beyond to advocate for healthy communities. CHC utilizes data, experience and the expertise of community stakeholders to shape policy, systems and environmental change.  This approach provides an exceptional opportunity for people of different backgrounds to build a shared understanding of the degree of health justice issues, allowing them to examine the root causes of health inequity. Among many accomplishments CHC has:


Trained hundreds of community members to conduct neighborhood level assessments to document food and physical activity inequities in South LA leading to local policy change.


Led the adoption of the Baldwin Hills Oilfield Community Standards District, South LA Fast Food Interim Control Ordinance and Fast Food Moratorium.


Convened the ReImagining Empty Space Tour and Summit: http://goo.gl/UOogw


Negotiated a community benefits agreement in response to the removal of 253 trees due to the transport of the Space Shuttle Endeavor. The agreement creates a South LA Open Space & Tree Master Plan. 





CLab, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation: CLabâ€™s research focuses on techniques for communication about urban environments. Work has included a vision plan for an estuary in South Korea, awarded the firstprize by the South Korean Urban Design Institute and a masterplan for Chengdu, China. CLabâ€™s projects use mapping as a means of uncovering hidden potentials in cities. A current project maps new, unacknowledged â€˜neighborhoodsâ€™ of New York, based on commonalities and underlying networks of support. CLabâ€™s project â€˜Locating the Middle Class in New York Cityâ€™ considers several possible criteria for defining the â€˜middle classâ€™ in the city, and uses GIS data to map their footprints. In researching aging urban populations, CLab has produced maps of NORCs (naturally occurring retirement communities) in NY, and is currently partnering with Tongji University in Shanghai to develop strategies and research for housing the aging middle class in China. 





596 Acres: In 2011, 596 Acres launched an online interactive map of all the publicly owned vacant land in Brooklyn, NY. Since then they have expanded the map by compiling and releasing data for Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Workshops and online networking tools have been created to help communities share knowledge with each other and build relationships with decisionmakers. In the short time since the project launched, 8 new sites have been granted official status as communityrun open spaces, and 6 additional sites have been preapproved by city agencies who have jurisdiction over them. Currently 105 groups citywide are in the process of campaigning for access to public land. With the recent release of vacant land data for the Bronx, the 596 Acres has mapped 1394 vacant lots in 4 of the 5 boroughs and is currently working on data for Staten Island. Spanish versions are also available.","Partners in the project will include Community Health Councils, Columbia Universityâ€™s CLab, and the 596 Acres Project. CHC will work with local organizations and city departments to ensure that the project will be of benefit to the communities it is intended to serve, and is informed by the knowledge, skills, and expertise of local community residents. CLab will contribute spatial analysis techniques, including GISbased mapping, as well as graphic design for the website and educational materials. 596 Acres will develop the core functionality of the website, drawing on its previous work mapping vacant land and creating online organizing tools in New York (596acres.org).","<p>The LA Open Acres Project will provide a muchneeded source of accurate information that will help stimulate debate about vacant land in LA, and allow citizens to cooperate to transform specific parcels. The project will compile information on vacant land, assemble it into a comprehensive database, and make it accessible to the public through an online interface, thereby allowing communities to learn about land resources in their neighborhoods. Although the ultimate goal will be to radically improve the number of acres of parkland per resident in the City and reduce the number of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from the nearest park, given the short term of the grant, the success will be measured based on data that would indicate the extent to which the Project is laying the foundation that will lead toward those goals, including:</p>





<p>       How many land parcels were reclaimed for public open space using the websiteâ€™s tools and how much total acreage is made available for public use?</p>





<p>       How many vacant lots are identified that were previously uncounted?</p>





<p>       How many people used the website to find vacant land and share information with their neighbors?</p>





<p>       How many organizations used the data in furthering their mission?</p>





<p>       How many urban greening projects were launched through the website?</p>





<p>These metrics are easy to obtain through communication with community participants and site usage data, and will help establish a baseline for evaluating the projectâ€™s success. But there are other, longerrange effects that may be harder to immediately quantify, including:


<p>       How many people use the open spaces that are created, and what is the benefit to their physical and mental health?</p>





<p>       How are local economies benefited by opening vacant land to public uses like green markets and farming?</p>





<p>       How is the information useful to city departments in shaping plans for open space in LA?</p>





<p>       How does the project promote a public dialogue about open space and land use?</p>





<p>       How does access to open space empower communities over multiple generations?</p>





<p>These effects will be the best indication of the projectâ€™s success, and should be possible to anticipate using shorterterm metrics like the number of land parcels that the websiteâ€™s users are monitoring and organizing to transform.</p>","Los Angeles is one of the most parkpoor cities in America: the Trust for Public Land found that only 30% of the LAâ€™s four million residents live within one quarter mile of a park compared with 80% and 90% in Boston and New York, respectively. The shortage of parks and open space is most acute in Los Angeles poorest neighborhoods, exacerbating a chronic disease and obesity epidemic that is closely tied to poor diet and lack of exercise. Given the critical need for parks, open space, and urban agriculture and the cityâ€™s limited ability to develop these resources on its own, LA Open Acres partners are spearheading an effort to create a new model that capitalizes on the opportunities that exist in vacant and underutilized land throughout the City, particularly in the areas most in need. 





No public agency or nongovernmental entity in LA has comprehensively identified where and how much of these vacant lands exist and the potential for new green space. Limited access to this information disables efforts to repurpose these sites into better serving uses. However, there is no lack of imagination on the part of community members. Using networks fostered by CHC for over 20 years, LA Open Acres together with communities will use this newlyavailable and accessible information to push forward exciting and innovative open space projects that are in tune with particular local neighborhood conditions, needs and visions. LA Open Acres can provide an opportunity for Angelenos to serve as a national model spurring innovation and dramatic change by organizing and advocating for better use of empty and underutilized space. The data, maps, and online networking tools provided by the LA Open Acres Project will allow community members to find information about available empty spaces, and connect with their neighbors to start organizing, in cooperation with landholders, for access to unused parcels. By providing information and resources, the project will allow others to work together to launch initiatives to transform the local environment. Furthermore, this data will inform the development of multiple planning processes occurring in the city now, including the development of a South LA OpenSpace Master Plan. This project will allow more people to access information, connect with decisionmakers, and participate in the planning process in their neighborhoods to create healthier neighborhood environments.  


","<p>LA Open Acres Project will put in motion a process through which, by 2050, every resident in Los Angeles will enjoy the environmental and health benefits of having parks and open space within an easy walking distance from their home. By 2050, neighbors working together throughout Los Angeles will create hundreds of community gardens, miniparks, urban farms, green markets, plazas, playgrounds, and other public spaces. LA Open Acres will serve as the catalyst and the wayfinding tool for these realizations of local desires  the key to unlocking the potential of acres of underutilized land. </p>





<p>Local and regional air and water quality will be improved, neighbors will have more and more opportunities to interact with one another, the heat island effect will be reduced, unsightly and hazardous abandoned properties will be eliminated, and ecological sanctuaries for people and wildlife will become a feature in every part of the City. </p>





<p>People will be healthier, thanks to access to parks for exercise and relaxation and gardens for growing fresh, organic food. People meeting in these small healthy places will incubate more projects and organize locally  the formerly desolate acres will be catalysts for improvements in public safety, social connectedness, and employment across the region. </p>





<p>This vision of the future begins by giving communities the information and tools they need to reclaim and repurpose these underutilized spaces.</p>"
3102057,2013057,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/pulseoflosangeles.html,The Pulse of Los Angeles: Assessing the Watersheds, Environmental Quality,"Council for Watershed Health will build a dynamic, publicly accessible and scientifically valid webbased report card to show how the efforts of our cities, nonprofit organizations, agencies, businesses and academia are working together to catalyze improvements in the environment. This report card will be based on the collaborative efforts of the many agencies and organizations that are tracking specific measures but are perhaps not able to see the big picture from their individual scales. 





Called â€œThe Pulse of Los Angeles,â€ the project will measure environmental indicators within a geographic context over time and compare where we are to where we need to go. The web portal will use maps to display the status and trends of environmental health, social equity, and economic sustainability in the region, based on alreadyexisting and newlydeveloped measures.





We will focus on tracking environmental quality measures, but will also uncover important connections between the eight realms: Education, Income & Employment, Housing, Health, Environmental Quality, Public Safety, Social Connectedness, and Arts & Cultural Vitality. We need to show, for example, how education impacts environmental quality and how safety is strengthened by arts and culture; in this way we can see the big picture of Los Angeles. By working together, we will demonstrate how collective impacts can make life better for all Angelenos.





Working with multiple project partners and continuing on the work weâ€™ve already started, the Council will demonstrate that â€œif you donâ€™t measure it, you canâ€™t change it!â€ By understanding how the region is performing and how all the work is interrelated, the paths forward will reveal themselves. As a result, Los Angeles in 2050 will be one of the most soughtafter places to live, learn, do business, and retire. 





We are on that path, with so many strong and purposeful organizations, agencies, and individuals pushing us forward. And yet we are in danger of not achieving this LA 2050 vision if we do not work together to deliberately monitor, track, and report important indicators of the future vision. In 2050, we will accept synergy and collaboration as a normal way of getting things done and this project will help build towards that future.","The Council for Watershed Health has collaboration in its DNA. The Los Angeles Basin Water Augmentation Study, begun in 2000, assembled a technical and funding advisory committee of federal, state, and local agencies and nonprofits to investigate the challenges and solutions for capturing stormwater in an urban environment. Early findings showed that it is safe to use polluted water runoff to increase our underground water supplies. Our publication â€œStormwater: Asset Not Liabilityâ€ (2nd ed. 2010) changed the way the region thinks about stormwater as a source of local water supplies.





In 2005 the Council brought together additional partners to design and build the Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project. With phase I completed in 2010, the awardwinning project is the most comprehensive â€œgreen streetâ€ in Los Angeles, converting a disadvantaged street in Sun Valley into a model of urban sustainability. Elmer Avenue captures and cleans more water than is used annually by the 24 houses on the block. The project is a focal point in the community with its meandering sidewalks, solar street lights, and diverse native and droughttolerant plants. In 2012 the second phase, a midblock alleyway, Elmer Paseo, was completed. The formerly asphalted alley now is a visually pleasing connector between the block and schools nearby that also captures and infiltrates water. 





In 2005, the Council began management of the first watershed monitoring program in the region for the San Gabriel River. In 2007 we began management of a similar research program on the Los Angeles River. In 2011 we produced an authoritative State of the San Gabriel River report and symposium; the State of the Los Angeles River report and symposium will be produced in 2013. Both programs operate with a workgroup of stakeholders that set the annual research and monitoring agenda. 





In 2008 we began work on a framework of indicators of watershed health in urban regions, the first such project in California to focus on cities. Completed in 2010, the project included a report cardstyle analysis of the state of the Arroyo Seco watershed. We are now working with the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority on indicators development and we have a US EPA grant for the Los Angeles River Watershed. Executive Director Nancy Steele focuses her 20122013 Stanton Fellowship on this topic and we will have a UCLA graduate fellow from the Luskin School of Public Policy for 20132014.





We host a Watershed Symposium series in which we bring divergent viewpoints together around timely topics. Examples include â€œRestoration and Development Challenges of the Los Angeles Riverâ€ (2013), â€œOn Track? High Speed Rail and the Los Angeles Riverâ€ (2010), and â€œNature Needs Water, Tooâ€ (2009). In 2012, the Council convened a multiday international conference, â€œThe Mediterranean City: A Conference on Climate Change Adaptationâ€ which kicked off the Mediterranean Cities Climate Change Consortium (mc4.org).","We will be taking a big tent approach, working with partners in our US EPAfunded Indicators of the Los Angeles River Watershed and the LA Urban Waters Federal Partnership. These include Los Angeles City and other cities, Los Angeles County, over ten federal agencies, and NGOs. Specific partners include Friends of the Los Angeles River, Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Urban Semillas, Climate Resolve, TreePeople, and Materials & Applications, Inc. We will invite other Goldhirsch LA2050 awardees to join a project advisory committee, assuring a multidisciplinary collaborative approach that is fundamental to the effort. We will also invite interested businesses to join the project.","â€œThe Pulse of Los Angeles: Assessing Watershed Healthâ€ is a twophase project. 





The first phase brings together an advisory group and partners into an LA network; by bringing together these organizations and agencies, the project sets the stage for a new era of collective action designed to last through to 2050. Building the network through working together and creating a dynamic product will be a lasting result. Thus, the project will be evaluated based on the creation of a network, including commitments of appropriate partners to making contributions of data and analyses to the Pulse. 





The second recognizable and lasting product is the very first Pulse of Los Angeles web portal, a dynamic mapping application that displays multiple indicators of health and allows users to query them for more details. We expect to accomplish this task by the end of 2013. Populating the data of the portal, of course, will be a continuous process that will get started in 2013, as expected for such a longlasting project. The success of the project will be measured by the successful creation of a web portal. ","Today, we know that many Angelenos donâ€™t have a strong connection to the systems they rely upon and have only a vague idea of the impact of climate change on their lives. The truth is that if we donâ€™t figure out how to live with the environment and within our water constraints, Los Angeles will fail as a major city. In thinking about how to catalyze the necessary changes, the Council for Watershed Health looks to its organizational â€œVision 2025.â€ We envision a future for LA with clean water, reliable local water supplies, ample parks and open spaces, revitalized rivers, and vibrant communities.  Looking at our own experience and examples throughout the region, we believe the creation of a report card is the most effective way to describe the progress towards this vision for all Angelenos to make them believe it is possible, and then update them regularly on how things were going.





In creating a clear and easily understood way to regularly inform Angelenos about the health of our environment, the Pulse of Los Angeles project will create the knowledge needed to embody ecological health, social equity, and economic vitality. By using water and watersheds as the organizing principle, the Pulse will reconnect people to their landscape and waterways. It will become one of the critical tools for changing how people imagine the city, pointing the way towards so many of the changes we now hold dear.





We recognize that human wellbeing is intrinsically tied to clean air, access to clean water, parks, and natural open spaces, and healthful food. The services provided by healthy ecosystems are essential to healthy communities and healthy people. In developing a tool that measures, values, and tracks progress towards urban water resources sustainability for the Los Angeles area we will catalyze the changes that lead to a healthy environment and strong economy.","In our 2050 the streams of the region meander inside their flood plains, sinking to replenish our groundwater or winding down to the ocean. The air is clear and clean. Beloved by Angelenos, people fish along the banks of the Los Angeles River & tributary streams while bikers, joggers, and walkers take up the riverside paths and enjoy the parks, set like jewels along the riverways. You can find native fish (tasty ones, too) in the rivers because the channels have been reengineered to remove barriers for fish swimming upstream. Trees overhang the water, cooling it off and providing organic inputs for stream health. Formerly endangered birds and amphibians are common. 





Wherever weâ€™ve built or rebuilt, our houses and businesses joyfully face towards the river; restaurants have riverside dining and diners enjoy watching nature flow by, along with kayakers and paddle boarder. When waters are high in the storm season, movable barriers automatically rise to protect our economic investments and save lives. No one who falls in the river is in danger anymore because of the automated safety lines that detect and snag you out of the water. 





Beyond the river, Southern Californians have embraced sustainable landscapes. The community of Sun Valley, having realized its envisioned Watershed Management Plan, enjoys a unique watershed culture in the San Fernando Valley. Researchers, practitioners and community leaders come from around the world to learn the story of Sun Valley. There, members of the community have set the standard for an urban landscape that â€˜lives with the landâ€™.





The days when Los Angeles was considered as the most parkpoor metropolis in America are a distant memory. Nearly every city resident lives within walking distance of a safe, clean park. These oases of nature amidst our urban landscapes are for human respite and wildlife habitat. Thanks to improvements in water quality, our beaches have never been healthier. 





At the midpoint of the twentyfirst century while we will be leaning on the successes of our forbearers, we will still have challenges to meet. The climate will still be changing in the face of the 20th century excesses but Los Angeles will have learned the value of adaptation through respecting its climate and geography.





Our healthy, sustainable, equitable and prosperous Los Angeles depends on all of us, working knowledgably together, towards this common vision. The Pulse of Los Angeles allows us to transform knowledge into action.

3102058,2013058,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/VoterParticipation.html,Increase Voter Turnout Neighbor to Neighbor Communication and Govt Responsiveness, Social Connectedness,"<p>We will increase voter turnout in City elections by creating online engagement tools and opportunities for citizens to 


1. communicate with and understand one another


2. build community that creates a stronger sense of ownership, connectedness and rootedness


3. hold elected officials accountable</p>


<p>We will use the latest proven online tools, and create some new ones, to leverage the power of the Internet and social media to turn make a lasting improvement in the city's social engagement and a replicable model for municipalities throughout the country.</p>


<p>Voter turnout in LA City elections is alarmingly low, at 21% in the last City election.  Four out of five eligible voters in Los Angeles did not vote. (One get into the runoff for a Council seat with fewer than 2,200 votes.) Citizens are not engaged, and social scientists debate the barriers to collective action. For instance, citizens may not believe their votes make a difference. They may not believe that elected officials are responsive to  specific voter needs. City residents may not consider themselves part of a community that values voting.   In some cases, citizens may not know there even is an election or where to vote if they do know about it.  More than likely a combination of these factors is at work.  Key to a more sociallyconnected city, a brighter future, is increased voter participation and turnout.</p>


<p>We will begin by targeting and communicating with voters who registered online to vote. Our expertise is in online organizing and mobilization that results in offline action. We know that those who registered online have experience and interest in participating on line. Moreover, social, economic and political indicators clearly suggest that over time, an increasing number of people will be active and engaged on line. So the tools and systems developed now will have increased value and impact in the future, right into 2050.</p>


<p>What will we do? First, we will create a tool that gives citizens a means to amplify their voices and concerns and to learn what their neighbors are concerned about in a fun and measurable way. This is an online petition tool in the manner of signon.org, but hyper local. Individuals can create a petition and ask neighbors to add their voices. It could relate to traffic, environmental, health, commerce, education, publicsafety, almost anything. Through this process citizens can share their concerns and learn what is on their neighborsâ€™ minds. Communicating with and understanding one another creates greater engagement and improved quality of life.</p>


<p>Petitions can then be brought to the attention of traditional media and elected officials. Concerns and responses can be monitored as elections occur. Petitions may even lead to ballot measures. At the same time, an oftenoverlooked constituency â€“ public workers  â€“ can benefit by knowing citizen concerns and being better enabled to meet their own professional and civic goals of solving public problems.


Secondly, weâ€™ll help create involvement, engagement, and concern about City election outcomes. We will ask citizens to â€œrank orderâ€ the list of petitionersâ€™ concerns. The goal here is to urge citizens higher on a ladder of engagement with public policy, and to provide public education about some of the stakes in City elections. Results of the ranking will be communicated to respondents and publicized through online and traditional earned media.</p>


<p>Third, weâ€™ll create social pressure for voting, and help establish a sense of community around participation, using an online tool with which we found success in 2012. In the last LA City election, more than 40% of the votes were cast by mail. To address these voters, our plan includes a Facebook tool that simply checks the names and hometowns of ones friends against the publiclyavailable records of who has mailed in ballots, updated each day. If all of oneâ€™s friends have voted, the tool shows it. If a few have not, it will tell the user who, and provide an opportunity to gently encourage them to vote. It's not too invasive, could hardly be simpler, and it gives voters a civicminded excuse to log onto Facebook!</p>


<p>Finally, each communication will include basic logistics: the date of the next election and a link to a tool for finding oneâ€™s specific polling place. Also, weâ€™ll hire an organizer to implement the project and weâ€™ll advertise in traditional and new media to promote the tools.</p>


<p>Social connectedness will be enhanced by increased voter participation as citizens become more engaged with one another. As elections are understood more personally, and the impact of participation can be seen, citizens will become more rooted in the community where they play a role. As their ideas and concerns come to distinguish Los Angeles, citizens will more likely engage in volunteer activity, contributing in tangible ways to the place that reflects their values and includes their voices.</p>","<p>Double Bubble: Courage won an unprecedented votingrights victory after thousands of LA voters were disenfranchised by a flawed ballot design. As the LA Times highlighted in a frontpage article, Courage uncovered the flaw and leveraged 32,802 petition signatures, and grassroots pressure to force the Registrar to count 47,153 ballots previously discarded. As a result, the County Registrar replaced the doublebubble ballot with a new ballot for DTS voters & the California Secretary of State revised ballot documents to clarify instructions statewide.</p><p>Prop 8 Trial Tracker: After gathering 140,671 signatures in three days calling for the Prop 8 trial to be televised, Courage launched Prop8TrialTracker.com, to promote transparency in the historic trial. US Supreme Court Justice Breyer referenced 138,542 public comments gathered by Courage in his dissenting opinion, in favor of televising the trial. Through liveblogging, coverage of breaking news, & expert commentary, the site gained over 4 million views & 100,00 comments. Our Equality on Trial website now provides up to the minute coverage of legal cases involving the rights of LGBT Americans.</p><p>Foreclosure Flashlight: In April 2012, following the introduction of the Homeowner Bill of Rights, Courage launched The Foreclosure Flashlight to shine a light on key California legislators, how foreclosures affected their districts, how much money theyâ€™d taken from the banking industry, & where they stood on a strong, prohomeowner bill. The online tool encouraged Californians to contact their legislators. One by one, we won the key votes. This was an unprecedented victory over Big Bank lobbyists to pass fundamental reform ending the most deceptive & unethical foreclosure practices. We were proud to partner with the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, California Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Responsible Lending, PICO, State Labor Federation, National Council of La Raza, CalPIRG, Consumers Union, Presente.org, & Rebuild the Dream.</p><p>Progressive Voter Guide: Each election season, Courage publishes the California Progressive Voter Guide. In 2012, the guide contained the recommendations of 14 progressive organizations, important deadlines including voter registration & votebymail, a Spanish version, & a mobileoptimized version for voters to easily access even while voting. The Progressive Voter Guide was viewed more than 252,365 times.<p>Prop 30: Courage Campaign played a key role in creating and passing Prop 30 in 2012, which produced muchneeded public revenue. Courage and partners created a ballot initiative, The Millionaireâ€™s Tax, which was more progressive than the Governorâ€™s revenue proposal. As a result of Courageâ€™s research and organizing, along with partners, the Governor compromised to incorporate aspects of The Millionaireâ€™s Tax & made Prop 30 more progressive & ultimately more feasible to pass, providing important revenue for vital services and education.</p>","Courage Campaign provides the permanent progressive online organizing infrastructure in California.  That is, after an Election Day, candidate and ballotinitiative committees fold, but Courage Campaign remains.  In addition to informing, organizing and mobilizing hundreds of thousands of California voters, our offline organizing includes holding quarterly â€œconveningsâ€ of more than 65 progressive groups in the state, most with a strong presence in Los Angeles.  We do not have a specific commitment from our partners for this project since we are in the process of applying for this funding opportunity, but we are confident that once underway, we can count on the participation of a significant number of our associates and their constituencies.","<p>We will look at this main metric:  did voter turnout improve?  Did it improve, controlling for confounding variables, within targeted segments of the votingeligible population, and specifically among those using the online tool set?</p>





<p>Prior to the next City election, when we can look at these figures, we'll need success indicators for periodic evaluation. Up through the end of the calendar year 2013, success will be measured by creation and use of the online tools: how many people use the petition tool, how many sign the petitions, is there media coverage or awareness among city residents or public officials regarding the content of the petitions, do citizens engage in the rankordering of petitionersâ€™ concerns?  In 2014, we will have the chance to measure the success of the set of tools and the organizing in an actual City election.</p>





<p>In just about three weeks, the Los Angeles City Clerkâ€™s office will have compiled figures to indicate how many of those who registered online to vote did in fact vote in the City election of March 2013.  We can set the specific success indicator for that group once those figures are released.  In any event, increasing the turnout will indicate success.  Moreover, we will be able to evaluate, based on public voter files, whether those who use the tools turn out to vote.</p>","<p>First, citizens will have a useful tool through which they can communicate easily & clearly with their neighbors, & understand one anotherâ€™s concerns, eliminating some of the disconnectedness that can characterize city life in LA. While online social media exist, as do online petition tools, the key to this project is combining the tools & organizing them to focus on a specific public goal in order to make use of their potential for improving quality of life & for creating a sense of community.</p>


<p>The current system of Neighborhood Councils in the city is a great idea and plays a vital role, but is not always easy for all citizens to access since meetings are held at specific times & places when not everyone is available. Using the online tools improves accessibility.</p>


<p>Secondly, city officials will have access to a means for understanding public concerns and ideas & will be able to improve responsiveness.</p>


<p>Third, voter turnout will increase. City residents will have a stake in the local elections since they can play a role in bringing issues to the ballot or informing candidate positions.</p>


<p>Fourth, as residents know their voices are being heard, & are able to witness their own impact, barriers to collective action will be reduced and other civic benefits will accrue such as increased levels of volunteerism and community participation.</p>


Finally, public policy will be improved in the sense that it will be more responsive to public needs.Only time will tell what specific policy initiatives and legislation will ensue to improve the lives of Angelenos, but a historical example provides an illustration of the power of public communication.</p>


<p>Forty years ago residents in an area of Niagara Falls, NY, experienced higherthannormal rates of miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, and other illnesses. Families suffered in silence, their struggles known only to their physicians and to close family or friends. When one family mom told a town meeting of her concerns about the environment near her home, other families chimed in with similar stories of illnesses. As they shared, they realized they were not alone, & that the high incidence in their neighborhood of sickness could not be a coincidence, but must point to a larger problem. The neighborhood came to be known to the nation as Love Canal and before they were finished, a committed group of housewives gained national attention for their concerns and forced into being some of the most important environmentalprotection legislation of the 20th Century. And it only happened once neighbors began to communicate & discover they were not the only ones with a particular set of concerns or experiences. If they had not talked to & heard one another, they might have simply continued to suffer in silence. In today's â€œtown square,â€ the Internet, citizens can share, ideas, voice concerns, better understand one another, & ultimately organize for action outside of the town square.</p>","<p>In 2050, we'd see dramatically increased voter turnout and increased overall participation in the electoral and civic process.  Citizens would share their ideas and needs and find out what ideas and needs their neighbors have.  City officials and civil servants would be eager to take advantage of knowing the public's concerns and would create a more responsive and relevant government, from essential services to regulations and revenue.</p>





<p>At the same time, city residents would have a strong sense of ownership over municipal government and policies.  There would be an enhanced level of participation in civic life including volunteering to serve the community. Owing to this increased ability to be heard, participate meaningfully, and have a role and impact on the city, families would deepen their roots in the community which would yield cultural, economic, publicsafety, and environmental benefits.</p>"
3102059,2013059,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/creoutreach.html,Transforming Lives One Show at a Time,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"CRE Outreach is a nonprofit performing arts organization that helps atrisk youth, the visually impaired, and military veterans in greater Los Angeles overcome their challenges through the creation of original works. Our programs actively engage the most underserved individuals, empowering them to live better lives and successfully navigate through todayâ€™s society. 





Programming


Our Changing Perceptions program provides visually impaired youth, teens and adults with essential lifeskills through the performing arts.  Through this program nonverbal students become vocal, participants confidently navigate a stage and move through space, and casts learn to work as a team towards a common goal. Theatre by the Blind, the countryâ€™s only theater troupe composed entirely of blind adult actors, provides participants with a constructive and creative forum to confront their challenges while informing the public and changing misconceptions about the capabilities of the blind.  Creative Youth Theatre provides atrisk youth with performing arts programs at underfunded schools and community centers. Studentsâ€™ explore their own hopes and struggles to create original stories focused on themes such as bullying, racism, peer pressure, and selfesteem. Heroesâ€™ Stories is a performing arts program with New Directions at the V.A. that gives military veterans a safe environment to voice their own heroic stories and experiences through theatre. Through these innovative performing arts programs, CRE Outreach is â€œTransforming Lives, One Show at a Time.â€


","In the past two years, CRE Outreach has become a fixture within the Inglewood Unified School District serving over 100 atrisk youth with afterschool programs, doubled our audiences for local productions, expanded our donor database by over 15%, and been able offer stipends to our Theatre by the Blind actors for the first time. Our seventh Theatre by the Blind production, Private Eyes, completed a successful sixweek run in April 2012. An audience favorite, the show was prominently featured in the Los Angeles Times and other local publications (see attached press).  In addition, we have forged a strong relationship with the Braille Institute and the Junior Blind of America to develop and execute artsbased programming in the Los Angeles area serving approximately 200 visually impaired participants. CRE Outreach has also become the parent company for Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music Center, which provides over 80 underserved youth with scholarships for instrument lessons and music instruction. Most recently, we have developed a partnership with the Veterans Affairâ€™s New Directions program to implement â€œHeroesâ€™ Storiesâ€ â€“ a performing arts residency that gives a voice to our nations brave service members helping to honor and empower them through theatre.","We have forged a strong relationship with the Braille Institute and the Junior Blind of America to develop and execute artsbased programming in the Los Angeles area. Most recently, CRE Outreach has become the parent company for Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music Center, which provides underserved youth with scholarships for instrument lessons and music instruction. Additionally, this fall we have started theatre programs at the VA, titled Heroesâ€™ Stories to help returning war veterans cope with PTSD and other related issues through theatre.","Participants will selfselect an item from processfolios to include in an oncamera interview highlighting the important aspects of their journey and a personal evaluation of the program as a whole. CRE Outreach staff will combine these interviews (with the permission of all parties involved) with video of rehearsals as well as the final performance to create a minidocumentary about the program that will include items from the studentsâ€™ processfolios, photographs, and footage from the program. A copy of the DVD as well as a written final report will be made available to participants, their families, and the schools. 





The effectiveness of our program is documented in the final report and measured through participation data including creativity journals, dialogue note cards between participants and instructors and process folios, teacher evaluation forms, and informal observations. CRE Outreach staff will collect these materials from class instructors and use it to track studentâ€™s individual achievements as well as document the impact that exposure to the arts has in a childâ€™s development and or/an individuals life. These assessment tools and results will then be used in future public and private grant proposals.


","By working in the greater Los Angeles community, on stage and in schools, using the medium of theatre, CRE Outreach confronts many challenges that atrisk youth and the disabled community face. Our work provides a constructive and creative forum for participants to bring issues to the forefront and let their voice be heard.  Our programs actively engage the most underserved individuals to live better lives and empower them to successfully navigate through todayâ€™s society.","Success would include Los Angeles embracing the theater community not only in terms of its inherent entertainment value, but also recognizing that the performing arts have transformative capabilities; the power to change atrisk youth into service oriented caretakers for the elderly and responsible stewards of their physical surroundings. In 2050 Los Angeles will be the epicenter of empowerment for disabled individuals to receive resources, opportunities for selfexpression, and meaningful employment. And in partnership with the VA, the Los Angeles performing arts community will help veterans successfully transition from combat into society."
3102060,2013060,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/createla.html,Create LA: Free Art Classes for Kids,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Our idea is simple  free quality arts programming for Los Angeles kids. Create LA is a nonprofit organization providing arts education programs to Los Angeles youth both in community locations and out of a facility in Glassell Park that it shares with Keystone Fine Art Studios, a group of over forty artists creating sculpture, paintings, public art, and media installations. The organization has worked diligently to create partnerships with local schools, businesses and organizations to deliver art instruction in various capacities, pulling from its immediate resource in supportive Keystone artists. Create LAâ€™s goals are to engage youth in quality arts education; promote the spread of specialized skillsets from this generation of artisans to the next; and provide an engaging community space for creativity to thrive.








Specifically the organization aims to accomplish these goals through the connection of Los Angeles artists with kids in the community. Create LA will provide community members with expanding opportunities for participation through involvement in various events and the establishment of free after school arts programming with weekend workshop offerings. Our idea will impact the Arts and Cultural Vitality indicator by creating an environment where established and emerging artists work together to envision possibilities, explore options, and manifest unique expression.


","Within the past year, we have been thrilled to work with a dedicated group of volunteers to provide free art workshops to youth in the community in various capacities. We have successfully engaged community members by hosting fundraising events in our facility, showcasing Los Angeles artists. We have been fortunate enough to participate in local initiatives, cosponsoring with American Legacy Fine Arts, Glassell Park Improvement Association, Eagle Rock Yacht Club, Glassell Park Elementary School, Los Feliz Arts Charter School, Los Angeles River School, eCALS, Saint Bernard Catholic School, Work Source California, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the City of Los Angeles.  We have worked hard to establish a network of support consistently contributing time, money, and materials to our cause, including California Arts Club, Glassell Park   Partners LLC, and The Classroom LA. We are excited about our upcoming collaboration with the Gang Reduction and Youth Development program of Los Angeles in piloting our after school program. 


","Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keystone Fine Arts Studios, Glassell Park Recreation Center, various Los Angeles based visual artists","Ultimately, Create LA aims to positively impact the Los Angeles community with its uniquely collaborative programming, fostering a lifelong enthusiasm for working creatively. Create LA will engage youth in quality arts education, promote the spread of specialized skillsets from this generation of artisans to the next, and provide an engaging community space for creativity to thrive. Evaluation of project success will be measured by increased demand for arts programming in the community, individual improvement of higherlevel thinking and expansion of artistic exploration among youth, and continued development of Create LAâ€™s network of contributing artists and volunteers. Youth will continue participation in more complex courses, which can be measured by increased enrollment. Artist statements will capture the individual growth of higher level thinking in the reflective process. Additionally, as the organization provides youth with the space and opportunity to develop discrete skills from Los Angeles artists in various visual art forms, success will be marked by an increase in interested artist participation. ","Only through the deliberate shift of skills, trades, and ideas can we succeed in engaging the next generation of thriving artists and creative thinkers. Create LA was formed in direct response to the problem of lacking affordable arts education among todayâ€™s youth. The organization has begun to engage the public via numerous offerings including after school programs, weekend workshops, and community art instruction. Over time the Create LA facility will grow to be an invaluable resource and engaging community space.





The Los Angeles community will benefit from our presence as an institution of art, education, business, and creativity. As arts enhance culture, Create LA will be adding to the cultural vitality of Los Angeles, while directly serving youth with quality arts programming. Create LA youth will also get firsthand experience with the business of art through exhibition in regular gallery shows, where kids can familiarize themselves with the presentation process of visual art while participating in exhibits and events. Create LA will have the opportunity to encourage artistic exploration in youth, expose young people to career paths in visual arts, and provide them with onsite artist role models in the invested Keystone Studios.


","The prospect of success in the year 2050 is exciting for the Create LA program. Through participation and engagement in a comprehensive visual arts program, generations of community members will incorporate their creativity into all aspects of life. Appreciation for the talents and accomplishments of others will be paramount, which sustains a vibrant and peaceful environment. 





Additionally, a portion of the Angelenos who have been involved with Create LA as students will now be artists in their own right, employing skills and techniques they have learned from artists before them and applying this knowledge in their current work. They will also be sharing and collaborating with the young learners of the city, continuing the tradition of passing on enthusiasm for learning in and through the arts to the next generation. The arts will be central to the development of young people, and the established artisans of the area will view sharing the process of creating art as an ordinary part of daily life."
3102061,2013061,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/creativeactivists.html,Creative Activist Program, Social Connectedness,"An Incubator, Academy, & Agency, our Creative Activist Program (CAP) is a place for LAâ€™s creative activists to turn ideas into action & for the Los Angeles community at large to become a force for change. In LA alone, we incubate, educate, & represent over 45 different media & arts projects, ranging in media types (film, multimedia, music, visual arts, & more) & focusing on our 6 core causes (human rights, youth & education, global consciousness, environment, gender equality, & health & wellness). <p>Individually, our creative activists exemplify a heightened level of social connectedness. Having identified their cause, they use a media type to address an issue & inspire action. Their work in turn demands social interaction & civic engagement, & their projects draw community involvement & local volunteerism. As a collective, CAP fosters the community necessary to galvanize action around these issues & improve the social well being of Los Angeles.</p>Current LAbased CAP projects include:





THE IMAGINATION FOUNDATION


Grown out of â€œCaineâ€™s Arcadeâ€ & with support from the Goldhirsh Foundation, the Imagination Foundation (IF) turned a viral video with 6 million views into a movement that now finds, fosters, & funds creativity & entrepreneurship in kids. In 2012 IF launched its Global Cardboard Challenge & hosted over 270 events in 41 countries. 





TENDER GREENS SUSTAINABLE LIFE PROJECT


A dynamic farming program developed by Tender Greens Restaurantsâ€™ founders, the Sustainable Life Project (SLP) provides transitioning foster youth with a safe, consistent learning & living environment.  To date, SLP has nurtured a class of interns to complete the program & become Tender Greens employees.





FOSTER THE FUTURE


This project is the band Foster the Peopleâ€™s philanthropic initiative that works with charities & communities to influence the act of giving back & creating community. 





In LA they work with 826LA, Breakaway Education, LA Guerrilla Gardening, & Social Justice Learning Institute.





The implementation of CAP throughout LA will consist of 2 different levels of engagement: 1) with individual high impact creative activists & 2) with the LA community as a whole. To our selected creative activists & their projects, we provide direct services as an Incubator, Academy, & Agency.





As an Incubator, we offer strategic & narrative development to map out their goals & objectives. We host an annual CAP Summit at our community Center in Malibu where we exchange ideas & share lessons learned. We also provide our creative activists with the ON Revolution, a resourcerich online social network where they can collaborate around their projects & meet one anotherâ€™s needs.





As an Academy, we nurture our creative activistsâ€™ talents & introduce them to critical knowledge through workshops & seminars in our CAP Academy Series & through panel conversations in our ON Rev Speaker Series. All content from these series is filmed & made available on the ON Revolution social networking site.





As an Agency we connect our creative activists with the people, funding, & networks they need. We also provide fundamental services such as fiscal sponsorship while matching them with industry professionals for mentorship.





Our engagement with the LA community at large will take form as an expansion of CAP, geared for the public. We will hold an LA Creative Activist Conference for a broad audience.  Fashioned in the style of an arts & mediacentric TED Conference, this will be a fusion of our CAP Summit & our ON Rev Speaker Series. The Creative Activist Conference will highlight the work of our creative activists, offer panels about our most successful projects, & host forums on innovate solutions for LAâ€™s pressing issues. This gathering will provide opportunities for the community to get involved through civic engagement & volunteerism. As part of CAPâ€™s immersion into LA, we will offer Angelenos exclusive access to the ON Revolution site, our ON Rev Speaker Series, & our creative activistsâ€™ satellite community events.





Armed with the endless possibilities of digital media, todayâ€™s Angelenos are all producers, journalists, storytellers â€“ piecing together a collective narrative & engaging in a global dialogue. What story will we tell?  Thanks to LA2050, this year we have the chance to make LAâ€™s story count â€“ to make it a story about the community that tackled issues like poverty, global warming, human trafficking, & educational inequity with films & words & photos.  





By nurturing LAâ€™s creative activists & extending their work deep into the LA community, CAP will enliven, encourage, & sustain social connectedness throughout LA. CAPâ€™s 45+ active local projects provide Angelenos with the opportunity to participate in the solutions that will determine the future of LA. Ultimately, our Creative Activist Program has the ability to make the story of LA2050 that of a community rich in social interaction, civic engagement, & volunteerism.","<p>To date Creative Visions Foundation has incubated over 150 creative activist projects and productions, reaching over 90 million people.  Furthermore, these projects have reached 195 countries across the globe, and a recent evaluation of our finances, found that for every $1 donated to Creative Visions Foundation, $2.44 is raised for our fiscally sponsored creative activist projects.  Additionally, since the launch of our Dan Eldon Center for Creative Activism in Malibu, weâ€™ve hosted more than 100 events, serving over 10,000 people through educational seminars and community program.  Specifically, as an Academy, CAPâ€™s Academy Series and ON Rev Speaker Series host approximately 20 events annually, which produce original content and generate roughly 300 minutes of finished productions a year.</p>





<p>Some notable projects to have come out of CAP include the following:</p>





<p>Video Volunteers:  One of CVFâ€™s first creative activist, nurtured by founders Kathy Eldon and Amy Eldon Turteltaub here in LA, Jessica Mayberry had a vision to teach illiterate Indian women  how to use film to tell their stories and fight their battles.  We helped her see it with business strategy, creative consulting, journalism education, and board development.  Today Video Volunteers has created the largest, most diverse network of salaried community producers in the world.  To date, Video Volunteers has created 15 community video units, trained 150 producers, employed 100 fulltime producers, held 1100 screenings, reached 200,000 people through screenings, produced 60 video magazines and 50 additional films, hosted regular video screenings in 350 villages and slums, spurred 2,000 people to take direct action.</p>





<p>Happy:  The latest documentary from Academy Award nominee and Angeleno Roko Belic, Happy sets out to answer the question and stimulate conversations around, â€œWhat makes you happy?â€  With a Facebook force of more than 30,000 Facebook fans, Happy quickly climbed to the #1 documentary on iTunes and declared February 11th, 2012 World Happy Day, holding over 600 screenings of the documentary in 60 countries on all 7 continents.</p>





<p>Living on One:  A documentary about 4 LAbased college students who spent their summer living on $1 a day in rural Guatemala to better understand extreme poverty, Living on One has screened in 25 cities to 52,000 people & launched a Student Microfinance Movement with participation from 55 universities. A resource for students to take microfinance classes, find internships, and attend conferences, the Student Microfinance Movement builds the skill set necessary to become successful social entrepreneurs.</p>","Bleick Studios

<p>We will evaluate CAP by detailing, measuring, and quantifying not only the impact that each of our LA CAP projects produces but also CAPâ€™s impact on the LA community at large.  We require that each of our LA creative activists submits impact reports that provide us with concrete metrics on their work, and we hold our own work to the same expectations. We will have impact reports on each of our nearly 50 LA creative activists as well as a comprehensive report on CAPâ€™s impact on LA as a whole.</p>





<p>In these reports, we assess impact, social media, strategy, media attention, and fundraising. </p>





<p>Regarding impact, we will detail what direct services have been provided, who has been served, and how many people have benefitted.  We will also evaluate what longterm effects the project produces, whom or what has benefitted from those effects, and the metrics surrounding those beneficiaries.  Additionally, we will assess how the project has influenced change and what outcomes have been produced that have helped shape key policies, rights, and/or freedoms.  Lastly, we will report on how our project has addressed the issues surrounding the root cause of the problem and implemented sustainable change.</p>





<p>Regarding social media, we will outline the projectâ€™s social media strategy, and we will detail, measure, and quantify social media traffic, reach, reaction, and action.  For instance, we will track who we are reaching, how we are reaching them, who is reacting, what they are saying, whoâ€™s taking action, what actions are most important, etc.</p>





<p>Regarding strategy, we will detail our projectâ€™s goals and objectives over the past year and illustrate how we reached these goals and objectives, noting the benchmarks along the way.</p>





<p>Regarding media attention, we will describe coverage received in 2013 and how the project received the attention.</p>





<p>Regarding fundraising, we will provide yearend financial statements, including the budget and expense report for the past seven months.</p>





<p>We will measure success by evaluating the metrics surrounding LAâ€™s volunteerism, voting, and civic and social engagement before and after the implementation of CAP in Los Angeles. LA2050 currently gives LA an orange rating for social connectedness, implying that LAâ€™s lack of social connectedness currently hinders human development.  With CAP, we strive to significantly enhance human development across LA, and we intend to measure that by quantifying the work of our LA creative activists and evaluating the social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteerism produced through our Creative Activist Program.</p>","Transcending the binds that educational attainment often places on individualsâ€™ exposure to and opportunities for engagement, CAP will strengthen social connectedness throughout LA by cultivating creative activist projects that offer social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteer opportunities.  CAP inherently affects LA2050â€™s metrics for social connectedness.





Regarding social interaction, CAP not only provides Angelenos with the ON Revolution resourcerich social networking site to communicate and collaborate around projects and issues alike, but it also offers the LA community a wide variety of events.  Aside from the LA Creative Activist Conference, Angelenos will now be able to attend an ON Rev Speaker Series event every 46 weeks.  Additionally, at our Dan Eldon Center for Creative Activism in Malibu, we host gallery openings, monthly Sundowners for creative activists to meet and mingle from April through September, and Sack Lunches for Angelenos interested in creative activism to come learn more.  Recently, weâ€™ve begun hosting occasional screenings and even held small festivals at our Center as well.  Separately, our 45+ creative activists and their projects host an array of satellite events around LA, from fundraisers to awareness events, available to the broader LA community.





Regarding civic engagement, each of CAP projects offers individuals numerous points of entry to mobilize personally and as a community around issues that matter most to them.  As a media and art centered source for engagement, we meet citizens at the core of what inspires them, and these projects call on the community to take action. For our creative activists, action can take many different forms â€“ from a Global Day of Play for a Cardboard Challenge to a screening and discussion around global poverty and microfinance.  Action can also mean donating to a cause to sustain its work or signing a petition to influence institutional change.





Regarding volunteerism, CAP and the projects under its umbrella survive thanks to volunteers, and we have a bottomless well of opportunities for volunteers to get involved.  The media and arts component of CAP functions as that entry point for the average, uninspired, uninvolved citizen to become inspired and get involved.





And with inspired, involved, invested citizens, LA has the potential to flourish as a community and tap into its own spark to ignite change both locally and globally.","<p>For CAP, success in 2050 would be an LA where weâ€™re interacting with one another, engaging in critical issues, volunteering for what moves us, and participating as voters to craft the narrative around our community. LA2050â€™s report on social connectedness looked bleak at best.</p>





<p>In 2050, we see an LA with over 50% of its residents active on the ON Revolution social networking site, or engaging with one another on whatever platform the ON Revolution has evolved to become.  More importantly, we see an LA where that same number of people, if not more, is interacting with one another face to face at a host of community events.</p>





<p>We see an LA with no fewer than 100 active LA creative projects operating under our Creative Activist Program, with an additional 50 projects having graduated to alumni and operating as their own 501Â©3s.  In turn, we see an LA with a dramatic rise in civic engagement, increasing the local donations raised and the number of petitions signed by at least 300%.</p>





<p>We see an LA where the rates of volunteerism have risen from 21.5% to 65.8% and the number of adults volunteering has climbed from 2 million to 6 million.  We see an LA that sits somewhere in the top 3 metro areas for volunteerism rates.</p>





<p>And we see an LA where weâ€™re voting and trusting and enjoying our community.</p>





<p>Above all, in 2050 we see an LA where social connectedness is not an indicator of human development but instead an essential part of life.  It is in our blood and sweat and DNA as Angelenos, and it is only the beginning of our potential to thrive.</p>"
3102062,2013062,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CuriousFoodTruck.html,Food Truck + Food Desert = Win Win Win! , Health,"<p>Imagine what would happen if a large supermarket chain deployed a small fleet of reimagined food trucks into the neighborhoods lacking access to fresh, healthy meals  neighborhoods where dialysis centers are popping up faster than the fast food joints that surround them...</p>                                                                                                                                           





<p>Food deserts are the perfect storm of many social, political, and economic factors, not just access.  Many families simply canâ€™t afford more nutritious foods, whether from traditional supermarkets or farmers markets, which have become more upscale than democratizing; singleparent or socalled latchkey homes often lack time to prepare truly healthy meals; and years of compounded challenges have meant that many residents of food deserts no longer know how to cook fresh, tasty meals from scratch.</p>                                                                                                                                           





<p>Food trucks in Los Angeles have been the province of the uppermiddle classes â€“ serving up specialty foods to those who can track their locations on Twitter via smartphones and wordofmouth.  But if we reframe the basic notion of food trucks, we have the potential to reach populations in need and can deliver much more than just mobile grocers, which are cropping up in places like Boston, Chicago, and Seattle.  The massive scale of Los Angeles, prototypical of a megacity defined by its sprawl, calls for a more versatile solution to address the complex dynamics underlying the health crisis spreading in food deserts. </p>                                                                     





<p>Enter Curious Catalyst.  Weâ€™re a unique consultancy â€“ more Swiss Army knife than agency  using agile and lean methodologies, credited for revolutionizing change in technology, to explore and rapidly iterate within urban solution spaces.  We believe that the old methods of topdown urban planning are worse than outdated â€“ theyâ€™re irresponsible. Our cities are changing so fast that we must use new approaches to experiment, refine, and address realtime, relevant solutions for our communities.</p>                                                                                                  





<p>Picture an established supermarket chain, in need of new revenue streams but unwilling to take a chance in less economicallydeveloped neighborhoods.  Now, consider the movers and shakers in that community who dream of opening restaurants, sharing recipes, and feeding their families back to top health.  Finally, how might we work with the existing Mom and Pop corner stores, who canâ€™t afford to lose business to new markets, even ones that offer healthy alternatives.  Until now, no one has considered how to come up with a winwinwin situation.  But Curious Catalyst specializes in finding new middle ground, which benefits all stakeholders.</p>                                                                                                                                      





<p>The CC Food Desert Food Truck pilot will explore how to leverage the distribution chain of an established supermarket brand, to offer prices that truly compete with fast food meals for the first time.  In addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, the CC Food Desert Food Trucks will provide a selection of prepared foods to help introduce new flavors and recipes, for families who may not have time to cook.  Weâ€™ll explore highlighting local LA chefs from different communities who promote simple, delicious, straightforward healthy eating. And, in order not to drive out neighborhood businesses, we will test partnering with existing bodegas and corner stores to set up regular schedules in an effort to drive more business.  In the long run, we can even imagine using the trucks to truly catalyze change, letting the supermarket use the existing bodegas as minimarts while the trucks move on to a new section of the neighborhood!</p>                                                                                                                                          





<p>Given that lack of access to basic nutrition impacts the ability to maintain engagement in education, longterm health forecasts, and stable employment potential, enabling regular access to fresh foods and education around eating habits can rebuild a foundation of wellness in food deserts.  A modest investment in offering true food security has major impact later on the cost of medical services provided by the city, as well as the opportunities then available to the residents of lower income neighborhoods.  And this kind of health intervention is not only good for us but also a way to fuel social connectedness â€“ food trucks are fun!</p>","<p>Curious Catalyst is a new consultancy that employs agile and lean methodologies typically associated with disruption in ICT to drive transformation and innovation in urban planning.  Composed of a senior corps of emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs.  We use a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the solutions we develop to other megacities.  For example, when we design a business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plugandplay core â€œExperience Blueprintâ€ will be released to other cities for a nominal license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to the initial stakeholder.  And we provide consulting services for localization and contextual adjustment.</p>





<p>This disruptive business model was developed by founder, Kaz Brecher, as part of an accelerator project at THNK, the new Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership. The members of the Curious Catalyst team have collectively worked on strategy and implementation of solutions for everyone from the Library of Congress to Microsoft, and Disney to Oprah.  Weâ€™ve done hundreds of agile sprints in emerging platforms, and our expertise is easily applied to the complexities of urban challenges facing Los Angeles.</p>





<p>The company has garnered support from some of the top architects and urban developers in the world, as weâ€™re building our Advisory Board.  And as passionate believers in usercentered design, we are committed to genuine collaboration with all constituencies when developing approaches to these solutions.</p>","Since we arenâ€™t investing in longterm infrastructure yet, weâ€™ll approach a passionate Food Truck Pioneer, who'll let us use their staff and truck; involve a Chef to help strategize on meals and produce; work with a community group, like Farmworks, to navigate existing neighborhood relationships; and weâ€™ll collaborate with a supermarket to test the realities of tapping into their distribution supply chain.  Weâ€™ll invite participation from food justice Subject Matter Experts, as well as food entrepreneurs, nonfood space design thinkers, and citizen stakeholders among others.  The goal is to balance orchestration of innovation processes while allowing the emergence of unexpected, communitydriven strategies by having the right mix of people.","<p>As with any lean Minimum Viable Product (MVP), our goal is to learn what resonates in the community and with all stakeholders and what needs to be adjusted â€“ with both qualitative and quantitative data. The food truck is only one method of using a more distributed approach to bringing healthier options into food deserts.  So, the primary goal is to demonstrate the potential, both socially and economically, for this method of disrupting the cyclical, endemic challenges that comprise food deserts â€“ bringing access to healthier foods as well as opportunity to gain employment as part of the changing landscape and ecosystem. </p>





<p>In this sprint, we will test several elements of how food trucks promote health and food security in food deserts.  These parameters could include: the variety of fresh produce SKUs and prepared meals; whether healthy frozen foods are more easily sampled; ways to collaborate within the existing neighborhood structures with Mom and Pop businesses; possible models for franchise versus scaling a fleet; using rotating trucks to catalyze small bodegas as micromart locations for major markets; and the kind of POP materials needed to make the offering attractive and informative.  </p>





<p>The sprint may be evaluated on several elements of the test, depending on how we define the MVP: cost of providing an affordable, healthy meal for a family as compared to a fast food option; interest and uptake of these meals; percentage of fresh produce purchased versus prepared food; interest in recipes handed out from the truck; buzz in the neighborhood around the idea and return visits to the truck.  Analysis will be conducted at the end of the prototyping phase, with an eye to shortterm and longterm scaling indicators.</p>





<p>A successful MVP is one that points the direction for the next sprint, providing new data and discovery about hypotheses, and gains traction from the community around the core proposition.  Needless to say, food deserts are not a new problem.  And various groups have attempted to make a dent in the issues and impact on Los Angeles.  We deeply believe that itâ€™s time for a new approach.  So, rather than evaluating this effort merely on what works and what doesnâ€™t in the MVP, Curious Catalyst will consider this a successful sprint if we demonstrate the potential for this new agile urban method to tackling the complexity of the entrenched food desert challenge. </p>","<p>There is no reason that the simple pleasures and benefits of fresh food that are enjoyed by citizens in Santa Monica canâ€™t be found in any other corner of the city.  Like a small house that is expanded room by room, until the wiring is a disastrous fire hazard, the LA sprawl has created pockets of neglect that leave citizens with unequal opportunity and weaker connections to the prosperity that the rest of Los Angeles enjoys.</p>





<p>And childhood obesity is a problem that is having a tremendous impact on not only the state's physical health but also its financial health.  According to a report by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, California spends more than $21 billion in public and private money on healthcare and other costs because of obesity, which increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases later in life.  Access to better basic nutrition tends to prevent longerterm chronic diseases, adding a buffer against the ramifications of lack of insurance.</p>





<p>The CC Food Desert Food Truck project will prove that itâ€™s possible to bring affordable access to fresh, healthy foods into neighborhoods in South or Central Los Angeles through new approaches, while exploring ways that the trucks could deliver even more benefit.  For example, a fleet of trucks could: create new jobs, provide education around eating habits and the causes of childhood diabetes and heart disease, offer new flavors and cuisines in areas where fast food is the only option, and create a sense of festivity with a regular schedule, building more social cohesion into neighborhoods.  </p>





<p>But this is just the beginning.  Los Angeles could fast be positioned as a leading innovator in food security issues, by taking this rapid iteration approach in the context of public/private partnership â€“ testing everything from multiuse trucks (meals combined with basic health monitoring from timetotime) to franchises for anyone interested in starting a new business.  The point is to START!  We canâ€™t wait for more task force reports or think tank strategies.  Involving residents in creating the city in which they want to thrive would be a success in itself.  We give power back to the people, while we facilitate a vision for a healthier Los Angeles.</p>","<p>The only boarded up buildings in South Central Los Angeles will be the old dialysis centers, a reminder of services no longer needed.  Food truck drivers will be as beloved a neighborhood institution as the ice cream truck driver of the 1950s was. The cost of chronic health care needs will have dropped significantly, and more taxpayer dollars can be reallocated to community gardens and planting food forests along parkways.  </p>





<p>Los Angeles will see a decrease in rates of childhood obesity and Type 2 diabetes, an increase in high school graduates from neighborhoods formerly known as food deserts, and the proliferation of new small businesses focused on food, from corner stores to restaurants to artisan goods.  Disparities in chronic diseases and health outcomes between those living inside and outside of the food deserts of the past would be indistinguishable.</p>





<p>As basic nutritional needs are met in every corner of the city, todayâ€™s young people and families will be better able to contribute to their own prosperity â€“ pursuing educational and employment opportunities, giving back in their own neighborhoods, and shaping the next 50 years of Los Angeles.</p>"

3102064,2013064,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/DearLosAngeles.html,Dear Los Angeles, Social Connectedness,"""Dear Los Angeles"" is a social media promotional network designed to get citizens of L.A. engaged in their society.  Creating videos and podcast content similar to the models forged by TedTalks and NPR, we plan on creating three brands that will engage citizens of Los Angeles in order to encourage political awareness, community involvement, and adult education opportunities:





Dear Los Angeles  Our flagship brand focusing on great things about Los Angeles, and great people who love Los Angeles.  Shining a spotlight on young volunteers, local innovators, local businesses, and local political initiatives, the goal of this project is designed to encourage and excite people about how they can make a difference in their local community.  Weekly videos will update participants on what's going on in the city, and how they can be a part of movements that will improve their living conditions.





The Producer's Lounge  Focusing on the multibillion dollar film & TV industry that many flock to L.A. for, this weekly audio podcast will focus on practical nuts and bolts of the entertainment industry, and how people can advance their careers and their financial stability within this field.  With financial stability, comes an increase in security, and an increase in long term community investment.





DEKIT  Partnering with an already established magazine published out of New York, DEKIT (http://dekitdekit.com/), weekly videos will focus on young creators and emerging artistic influences in Los Angeles.  Part of the Dear Los Angeles/Dekit videos focus will be on young artists, in order to reach out to students, particularly middle school students.  





All these pieces of content combined will tell the many varied stories of this very complex city.


","None.  





Our organization has not published anything public yet.  I conceived this idea about three months ago after talking with the CEO of Dekit Magazine.  If I were to receive this grant, I could have the website and social media channels up and running in less than a month, and weekly episodes for all 3 brands out in less than two months. 





I can tell you that as an individual, I have line produced two feature films, one of which was acquired and released by Lionsgate (you can view my resume on IMDB at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1336027/).  I have become a member of the Producer's Guild of America, and I partnered with others on two separate internet media companies, and while they fell short of expectations, I have learned from their mistakes.


","After living in Los Angeles for over a decade, I have a large address book of contacts in industry, education, and politics.  I will utilize these contacts to build content on growing movements, and events that are affecting the greater Los Angeles metro area, and will continue to affect it for decades to come. 





In addition to my own personal relationships, I have formed a partnership with the aforementioned Dekit magazine (http://dekitdekit.com/) based out of New York, and we will be capitalizing on crosspromotional opportunities, as well as brand sharing, in order to gain as large an audience as possible.   


","This is one of the key indicators that will set Dear Los Angeles apart from other online media outlets.  Many organizations which broadcast information online measure their success by subscribers, sponsorship revenue, and Likes on their FaceBook page.  





While this will be an important indicator for us, our real measure of success will be offline activity.  How many people will volunteer for a neighborhood improvement project after seeing our content?  How many people will investigate a new artist or artistic movement after viewing our coverage?





Our measure of success is more than just views; it's our followthrough rate, which can be measured through website analytics and clickthroughs to other L.A. based organizations, and attendance at important L.A. events.  These can be traced through metrics following clickthroughs to tracking pages on our website, and seeing how many of these click through then proceed to our partnersâ€™ websites.


","I've lived in Los Angeles for 12 years, first moving here from Connecticut to attend film school at USC.  Since then, I've seen many people move here and leave, and become angry and agitated about Los Angeles.  They viewed it as a city with no art, no connectedness, and no real opportunities.  However, the reason I love L.A. and have stayed here for so long is because of the art, the culture, and the limitless potential I find here.  I've received and witnessed endless opportunities, and I want to convey that to the people around me.  





By conveying that excitement, we will mobilize hundreds of people across the greater metro area to get involved in beautification projects and voter initiatives.  We can motivate people to volunteer as a social activity, as well as an important lifelong goal.  We hope to engage in early outreach, in order to get ahead of the trends and the important movements, instead of just following them.  


","In 2050, the Dear Los Angeles brand and organization will branch out using advancing forms of technology to bring Los Angelinos together.  





If we can combine local resources to alleviate local problems, then we can make a difference in this city for the better.  By 2050, Dear Los Angeles will be responsible for increasing local volunteer work for neighborhood improvement threefold.  Currently 25% of Los Angeles residents rate their communities s fair or poor (California Community Foundation), but by 2050, Dear L.A. initiatives will help bring that number down to single digits, and make people excited to live in L.A. again.  Dear Los Angeles will focus on informing Los Angelinos on important local political matters, and on their political options.  





This invites and empowers new residents of Los Angeles to take part in their city, accelerating the acclamation process, and as a result encourages trust in their neighbors, and increases the knowledge and resources they need about their social and civic institutions.

3102065,2013065,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/delab.html,Making LA,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Design East of La Brea (de LaB) is seeking programming support for a yearlong tenevent series entitled â€œMaking LA,â€ which will take place between June 2013 and June 2014. The special event series would feature ten important and inspiring projects located across the east side of Los Angeles, where attendees will have the opportunity to learn from the designers, architects, and artists who completed and/or fostered these projects. The series will culminate in 2014 with the â€œMaking LA Conference,â€ a oneday conference hosted on the east side of L.A., that features local creatives instructing attendees on the elusive act of implementation for socially focused design ideas. The â€œMaking LA Conferenceâ€ will also significantly highlight each of the creatives featured within the yearlong â€œMaking LAâ€ event series, in addition to effectively educating hundreds of local creatives on how to move forward on their own projects for Los Angeles.





<br><br>


The â€œMaking LAâ€ programming series will consist of ten de LaB events that take place at significant sites across the east side of Los Angeles. These events will last anywhere from two to three hours and will feature a tour, talk, or workshop about the project by the designer, followed by questions and a reception. Attendees will get to hear firsthand from the designers and architects of these ten influential projects for Los Angeles, and begin to learn how such projects became reality. Each event will be free and open to the public.


<br><br>





The â€œMaking LAâ€ programming series will be based on the past success of de LaBâ€™s regular programming activities. Since 2008, de LaB has hosted close to 100 events that encourage audiences to see Los Angeles in a new light. This series will be no different. Events may be modelled after past successful events, where attendees were encouraged to see and experience a new neighborhood or a new important architecturally significant building, or a temporary structure that promises to bring important aesthetic and urbanistic qualities to a largely underserved community. Examples might include tours of the restoration of iconic and historic hollywood buildings, such as the historic Hollywood Tower and the renovation of the Best Western Hollywood Hills, which shows how developers are working together to improve a city block. 


<br><br>








Other possible events could include a new twist on some of de LaBâ€™s most popular annual events, including: <br>


	The City Listening forum, which invites local writers, designers, and design celebrities to perform readings on Los Angeles urbanism in front of an audience of over 200 people.<br>


	The annual DesignnDim Sum bike tours which has encouraged attendees to travel from Highland Park to Chinatown, visiting design and art studios along the way.<br>


	The annual PARK[ing] Day intervention, held in partnership with the restaurant Local, which features pocket parks created on Sunset Boulevard to raise awareness for the lack of green space in the neighborhood.<br>


	The Obscura Day tour, which visits the Tile House, an incredible architectural marvel designed by folk artist George Ehling and is not open to the public.


<br><br>








The â€œMaking LAâ€ conference, to be held in spring of 2014, will be attended by up to 500 local creatives and will focus on teaching the specifics of how to move from the idea to the implementation phase. Speakers will address issues ranging from funding to fabrication, with a focus on Los Angeles resources and support. Workshops will give handson experience and practical, real life advice. Possible venues include the new Ace Hotel in downtown L.A., located within the renovated United Artists Theater, or Atwater Crossing, a large creative venue in Atwater Village.","We've built a community of committed design enthusiasts in Los Angeles in about 4 four years. We currently have over 1,000 followers on Facebook, nearly 700 followers on Twitter and 3,000+ email subscribers. 


<br><br>





Our events consistently reach capacity within hours of announcing them, and typically have waitlists. We plan, program and host about 2 events per month, and expose new audiences to innovation and creativity in LA. We also aim to bring people into spaces and neighborhoods they may not visit otherwise. We've experienced consistent growth for our recurring events, such as the designndim sum bike tour and Palm Springs Modernism Week. 


<br><br>





In 2012, we hosted our first home tour, bringing people into four outstanding examples of urban infill and sustainability in Echo Park, all within walking distance of one another. Two of the homes on the tour were then included in Dwell's home tour two months later. 





<br><br>


In December 2012, we also received our nonprofit status and are currently applying for grants for the first time. 





<br><br>


Highlights from de LaBâ€™s 20112012 programming year include: A tour of the Subway Terminal Building in Downtown L.A. featuring the abandoned subway platform and tunnels that housed L.A.â€™s first subway system; A tour with the designers and public health officials behind L.A.â€™s first streettoplaza conversion, Sunset Triangle, a new public space for the Silver Lake neighborhood; A private tour of the BWP EcoCampus in Burbank, a reclaimed substation which has been transformed into community green space by AHBE landscape architects; A presentation by FER Studio featuring their master plan for Inglewoodâ€™s downtown revitalization; A walking tour and published map of 31 locations in West Hollywood to honor de LaBâ€™s late friend, urban designer John Chase, who was responsible for much of that city's great urban design; A tour of HOLAâ€™s brandnew community center in Lafayette Park designed by Steven Kanner, which provides arts and athletic programming for underserved youth; A tour and fundraiser for Richland Farms, an agricultural community in the middle of Compton, where cowboys and horses coexist with programs to bring farming to urban youth; A walking house tour featuring four Echo Park residences that use small footprints and sustainable design to create communityminded residences in a dense neighborhood; A bike tour of Long Beach, one of the most bicyclefriendly cities in the country, and its rapidly transforming infrastructure of parklets and roundabouts, with advocate Charlie Gandy.","Below is a list of designers, architects and artists de LaB would plan to feature as inspirational projects or speakers. We've worked with many of the people and organizations listed in the past:


<br><br>





Michael Maltzan, Emily Jagoda, Ball Nogues, FER Studio, Geoff McFetridge, Bunch Design,  Knowhow Shop, Karen Mack, Christine Outram, Mia Lehrer, Frank Clementi, Anonymous Architects, Barbara Bestor, Krista Kline, KCRW, LA Forum, A+D Museum, Peter Zellner, Skid Row Housing Trust, Vincent Price Museum, DLANC, MTA and others. ","de LaB targets a diverse audience that includes members of the architecture and design community, city planners, urbanists, design enthusiasts, students, activists and many more. Currently, the organizationâ€™s reaches more than 3000 interested individuals and regularly reaches maximum capacity for programming. 


<br><br>





Since its inception in 2008, de LaB has consistently recapped each and every program for the benefit of individuals unable to attend a particular event. This project will be no different. Indepth recaps of the events will be covered at length on de LaBâ€™s website. Additionally, de LaB will work to create a largescale publicity campaign, reaching out to local public radio, blogs and social media to alert the community at large about the programming.





<br><br>


de LaB will closely monitor both the number of people attending events and also the demographic of participants to better understand which communities are being directly affected by the programs. Following each program, participants will be surveyed on their interest in the program, what they learned, and how it better helped them understand the way in which architecture and design can transform cities for the better.





<br><br>


The series will be free and open to all members of the public, except for the conference, where we will offer three needbased scholarships to students or lowerincome attendees. de LaB will seek to make all program sites fully ADA accessible so that all members of the community can fully benefit from the programâ€™s impact.


<br><br>





de LaBâ€™s â€œMaking L.A.â€ project connects to a vision of LA2050 because we believe that itâ€™s no longer up to the corporations, administrators, and elected officials to create change in our urban communities. The unique combination of creative energy, a commitment to knowledgesharing, and technology allows any citizen with a great idea for her city to move it forward. We want to enable and empower all creatives and help them to implement their vision for the city of the future.","de LaB anticipates that our audience will be thrilled to support a yearlong â€œMaking LAâ€ series, in which each person has the chance to meet and interact with the creative individualsarchitects, designers and artistswho are shaping and in some cases, reshaping, the future of Los Angeles. Measurements of success will based upon de LaBâ€™s ability to reach new and diverse audiences at rapid speed, which we have done in the past. <br><br>








In spring 2012, de LaBâ€™s Subway Terminal Tour spiked the organizationâ€™s number of email subscribers by one third in a single month due to the overwhelming desire by Angelenos to understand our cityâ€™s great past. de LaB anticipates that new programming that has the impact to affect the way people feel about their city will foster the same enthusiasm. Additionally, de LaBâ€™s goal, as always, will be to reach more and more diverse communities of Angelenos who attend our events, not because of a particular affiliation with the design community, but purely because they love the city in which they live and they want it to be a healthy, sustainable and dynamic place well into the future.  ","Our mission is to celebrate and support local creatives in their efforts to enlighten, improve and engage the city. Through events that are educational, inspirational and handson, de LaB brings attention to the unique way that architects and designers are transforming the city and unites an enthusiastic community of local residents who are invested in the future of L.A.





<br><br>


We've already seen a great deal of enthusiasm for any of our transitrelated events, including a tour of the abandoned subway tunnels, a food and design tour of the Gold Line extension, and a tour of the public art at Expo Line stations. Additionally, our designndimsum bike tour has grown exponentially each year. 


<br><br>


If we can continue to bring creatives together to not just support these types of projects (e.g. transit and street design) but also to participate in the creation, design, building and usage of these projects, we would consider that a success. 


<br><br>


The one thing weâ€™ve learned from our community of over 3000 creative Angelenos is that theyâ€™re hungry to bring change to their city. But there is a definite disconnect between having great ideas for L.A. and knowing how to best implement them. Our events serve as informal, highly personal workshops where the architects, designers and architects who are getting things done in L.A. can help other professionals to take their bold dreams for Los Angeles and turn them into reality. The case studies that will come out of our events can be shared with creatives in any city, to help them make that same leap for their sociallyfocused urban projects.


<br><br>


Last, LA is already recognized as a center for artistic production globally. We would like to broaden that definition beyond the fine arts into infrastructure, architecture, product and industrial design and have local artisans/designers recognized not just in their home city but elsewhere in the world.

3102066,2013066,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/diyfo.html,DIYFO: DIY For Others. An accessible space for cultivating creative talent,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"     DIYFO shares the sentiment set forth by the LA 2050 report, that cultivating and training creative minds is paramount to Los Angelesâ€™ continued cultural success. We teach a variety of DIY skills, through events and workshops â€“ always with a charitable component.  Currently we present events in host spaces, but we want to expand and increase the frequency and scope of our programming, and to also establish a home base in Downtown Los Angeles that serves a threefold purpose: to provide a permanent home for learning, to exist as a gallery for showcasing work and ideas, and to house an opensource studio and workshop, in which community members can access tools and equipment as varied as 3D printers, bicycle repair tools, and sewing machines. 


     With specific classes designed to reach adults, children, and teens â€“ covering a variety of skills and techniques â€“ DIYFO will provide an opportunity to learn and grow: to develop talent that may otherwise have been left uncultivated, and to promote participantsâ€™ lifelong appreciation for the importance of making.  As with the workshops we currently present, a portion of the instructional fees will directly benefit local nonprofit organizations.


     In addition, DIYFO will host talks and special events, designed to coincide with exhibited work, offering a unique opportunity for the public to access and understand art in an interactive environment. Work will be available to purchase, and a portion of the proceeds from each sale will be donated to partner nonprofit organizations.


     Finally, DIYFO will provide access to equipment and art supplies in a studio setting. Visionaries of all skill levels will get the chance to learn from one another, and to collaborate on impactful, innovative work.  We will also continue to coordinate directly with charitable organizations to provide onsite instruction and outreach to the people they serve. 


     At DIYFO, we believe that everyone has creative potential, and that there exists great value in the ability to work with oneâ€™s hands â€“ to solve problems, and to make something completely new.  We believe that this approach will instill a confidence in the people we reach directly, and create a ripple effect of increased appreciation for arts and culture, citywide.


","     In fewer than 18 months, DIYFO has grown from an arts and craftsoriented meeting among friends at a bar, to an organization whose vision will change the way Los Angeles uses and cultivates its creative talents.  We have teamed up with organizations like Junior League Los Angeles and Aviva, and are driven by our desire to reach those in need.  DIYFO has also partnered with organizers of events like Unique LA Local Love 2012 and the LA Weekly Pancake Breakfast to host onsite DIY projects â€“ free of charge â€“ for the eventsâ€™ thousands of attendees, and will partner with Jubilee Music Festival to do the same in June.  We also continue to provide programming around the city in our sponsor venues â€“ teaching DIY, while working to raise money for a variety of organizations.


     We plan to accomplish much more in 2013 and beyond, by instituting our pilot program in a physical space, while meanwhile expanding our multimedia content to extend our reach â€“ using all available resources and outlets to provide artistic opportunities, advance appreciation and understanding, and unlock the creative potential in all of LAâ€™s residents.


","We have presented programming with nonprofit organizations and have worked to raise money for still others, like MidOhio Food Bank and Downtown Womenâ€™s Center, and we will only expand this outreach. We also plan to bolster our community and commercial partnerships to provide innovative and dynamic experiences for our constituents.  Finally, we hope to develop programming with institutions, universities, and galleries to activate the DIYFO space and other organizationsâ€™ spaces around LA: fostering citywide enrollment, and weaving DIYFO (and the culture we promote) into the very fabric of Los Angeles.","     Because DIYFO is relatively young, establishing a designated headquarters will be, in itself, a huge measure of success. However, this initial milestone will be followed by markers that include the diversity of the workshops we offer, the range of the artwork we exhibit, the resources we are able to contribute to people in need, the scope of the skills and equipment to which we provide access, and the ability for DIYFO to sustain itself: with the longterm goal of expanding its physical presence, via satellite spaces throughout the city.


     During the first portion of its twopart pilot period, DIYFO will offer one to two workshops per week in host spaces, and will organize exhibitions and special events and talks.  During the second period (October through December 2013), DIYFO will inhabit a popup space in Downtown Los Angeles, presenting 5 workshops per week, events and special sessions, rotating exhibitions, and core openstudio access.  Success in this regard would be reflected in the crowd, awareness, and resourcebuilding that the programming would draw, allowing for enhanced programming in 2014 and beyond.


     Being successful will also mean that we are able to allocate resources to directly benefit local charitable organizations, in donations of materials, funds, and time, as well as in access to handson learning programs and public art projects, conceived of and carried out by members of the DIYFO community.


     Each accomplishment will signal a small victory for DIYFOâ€™s mission to change the way Los Angeles (and as a result, the region) approaches art and innovation.  Developing unique and dynamic programming, reaching new people, staying current with material resources and expert knowledge, and making a significant contribution to the community, will all signal the ultimate indicator of DIYFOâ€™s success â€“ the development of a vast and vital community with collaborative DIY at its heart.


","     With over half a million residents employed in the arts, itâ€™s evident that Los Angeles abounds with talent, and we call upon innovators and arts professionals to share their what they know with others through talks, workshops, and exhibitions.  We bring people and resources together, catalyzing an exchange of ideas and knowledge, and encouraging collaborative projects beneficial to Los Angeles â€“ from public outreach to innovative projects that blur the boundaries of art, social engagement, and technology.


     Funding for public arts education is waning, but we believe that people of all ages and backgrounds should have access to the tools and knowledge that will allow them to realize their greatest ideas.  By offering programs designed for various age groups, we will help our students develop their creative talents, and equip them to change the world.


     We will remove the barriers created by the necessity for highly specialized supplies and equipment, by creating a fully equipped studio space â€“ allowing Angelenos an opportunity to learn in a guided, collaborative environment.  Members of the DIYFO community will also be encouraged to contribute their unique abilities to our workshops and events.


     We will empower talented people to achieve great things, spurring a culture shift that encourages creative community engagement.","     Success would mean significant reach for DIYFO, but more importantly â€“ a thriving creative and collaborative culture that would be the standard in Los Angeles: allowing artistic talent to grow and remain in LA, and attracting gifted individuals from elsewhere.  As the lines between art and science and technology continue to blur, we hope to create a community on the frontier â€“ cultivating traditional artistic techniques, and educating people about technologies like 3D printing and fabrication â€“ resulting in cultural endeavors that cross boundaries of medium.  


     DIYFO wants to spur a culture shift â€“ catalyzing a movement toward a full embrace of the value of creative skills, and the vital significance of communitybuilding. Success in 2050 will be signaled by the development of crossindustry ideas and practices that stem from an embrace of merging art and innovation.  LA in 2050: a city where handson, imaginative cooperation is incorporated into the solutions to problems of any scale.

3102067,2013067,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/dogoodbus.html,Do Good Bus | Free Rides , Social Connectedness,"The Do Good Bus is an opportunity to get involved and help your community. Just get on the bus and we do the rest. Each trip is different and the locations are a secret.  If you have always wanted to get involved, volunteer or help others but didnâ€™t know how â€“ hop on the Do Good Bus!


<br>


<br>


We currently host monthly community rides to give Los Angelenos an opportunity to learn about local causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people in their city.  Over the past three years, weâ€™ve visited dozens of causes and connected hundreds of volunteers.  In order to expand and give more people in Los Angeles an opportunity to participate â€“ we need to buy a bus.  With our own bus, our goals are to: double participation, offer one free ride per month and focus on teaching youth the importance of giving back.  


<br>


<br>


DOUBLE TIME & MAKE IT FREE


<br>


With our current costs and bus rental availability, we are limited to one community ride per month. These rides require people to purchase a ticket.  We believe thereâ€™s true value in a Do Good Bus ticket (you even get a gourmet lunch!) but we also know the ticket can be a barrier for some.  If we could host one FREE ride per month in addition to a ticketed ride  viola!  weâ€™ve doubled the amount of people who can connect and doubled the amount of GOOD we can do.


<br>


<br>


KIDS AND GIVING BACK


<br>


In line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education and social connectedness, weâ€™ve been working on ideas to engage students via the Do Good Bus.  We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of giving back and connecting with their community.  In fact, weâ€™ve started hosting FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kidfriendly volunteer activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back.  We would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools  giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their curriculums. 


<br>


<br>


The LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to social connectedness levels.  While we donâ€™t have the resources to ensure kids make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with students across neighborhood lines and with a world outside of the classroom.  In addition, a Do Good Field Trip would expose students to unique career options (i.e. Nonprofit CEO or Do Good Bus tour guide)  potentially giving them new motivation to make it through school. ","Do Good Bus <a ref=""http://dogoodbus.com/index.php/fosterthepeopledogoodbus/>partnered with the band Foster The People</a> (FTP) to launch their charity initiative, Foster The Future during the bandâ€™s 2011 Summer Tour. In an effort to engage and inspire FTP fans, Do Good Bus loaded up with 30 fans before each concert along the 25 city tour.  Fans participated in a local community project in their city and had fun along the way. In total, we connected with over 750 people, thirty percent of which were firsttime volunteers and helped create awareness and support for 25 causes across the United States.  


<br>


<br>


Locally, weâ€™ve partnered with dozens of Los Angeles causes to give Los Angelenos an opportunity to connect and give back.  Weâ€™ve painted massive murals, helped students write their college entrance essays and sorted dog food for some of the cutest rescue animals in Los Angeles.  


<br>


<br>


Some of our favorite rides include working with: 826LA, Meet Every Need with Dignity (MEND), Best Friends Animal Society and most recently, Fantasia Family Music Theater.  As a specific example, weâ€™ve had an ongoing relationship with Social Justice Learning Institute (SJLI) and have been an integral part of their â€œ100 Seeds of Changeâ€ initiative to change Inglewoodâ€™s status as a â€œfood desertâ€.  In the past 6 months, weâ€™ve had over 100 volunteers get their hands dirty to help give Inglewood residents better access to healthy food choices.","<br>


<br>


BUS PARTNERS


<br>


For the nitty gritty logistics, Townride, Inc. would like to offer their expertise in helping us through the purchase and refurbishing process of creating the coolest Do Good Bus possible.  We are also working on a plan to partner with Townride for storage and maintenance.


<br>


<br>


EDUCATION PARTNERS


<br>


As for causes and organizations who can help us make Do Good Field Trips a reality, weâ€™re looking forward to working with No Right Brain Left Behind, Green Dot Schools, Breakaway Education and Zimmer Childrenâ€™s Museum.","We keep track of how many people experience the Do Good Bus each year and how many of those people return to volunteer at select causes.  If we could double our numbers, weâ€™d consider it a huge success.


<br>


<br>


Outside of pure numbers and excel spreadsheets, we measure our success by trying to accomplish three goals:


1.	Create Awareness


2.	Create Community


3.	Encourage Continued Support


<br>


<br>


We already track each of these goals and would continue to do so by doing the following:


<br>


<br>





AWARENESS: We are creating awareness about Los Angeles causes for Do Good Bus participants, which is easy to measure by simply counting how many people get on the bus.  But we are also committed to creating a broader awareness for each specific cause by consistently mentioning and supporting them via Do Good Bus social networks and ideally, the social networks of our 30 passengers.  We know the power of word of mouth and encourage all our participants to share their experience via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and good olâ€™ fashioned coffee dates.  We are currently working on a template to track and report increased awareness for the nonprofits we visit to show the benefit of partnering with Do Good Bus.


<br>


<br>


COMMUNITY: This category could also be called, GETTING DIGITS.  Our favorite part of a Do Good Bus ride is seeing people connect and find a common ground.  We are constantly amazed to see people trading information at the end of our rides so they can reconnect in the future.  Past doGOODers have gone out on dates, found new babysitters and even started their own small community projects. All because we put them on a bus together!


<br>


<br>


CONTINUED SUPPORT:  After each Do Good Bus ride, passengers receive a follow up email with info on how to continue to support the cause they visited as well as other causes in Los Angeles.  We do our best to work with the nonprofits and causes to monitor and track return volunteers and hope to increase those â€œreturn ratesâ€ as we move forward.  Ideally, our goal is to check in twice a year with people who have been on the bus and give them examples of new ways to help and creative ways to get involved.","If Do Good Bus can host multiple rides per month and offer one of them for free, we can give more Los Angelenos an opportunity to help their communities.  In one year, over 1,000 people will be newly connected and if we add Do Good Field Trips to that number, we end up with 1,000 newly connected kids as well.


<br>


<br>


One of our goals on the bus is to encourage continued support and inspire people to do good on a regular basis.  For us, that doesnâ€™t always mean returning to the cause we just visited.  During a ride, passengers are not only exposed to meaningful causes they are also introduced to what it FEELS like to give back. We encourage them to harness that feeling and search for ways to find it again in their every day lives.  We strongly believe that inspiration in people will continue to shape Los Angeles into a more connected place.  


<br>


<br>


In addition to one free ride per month and Do Good Field Trips, owning a bus would give us a unique opportunity to help Los Angeles in a hyperlocal capacity.  With 24hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough seats for 30 willing volunteers, weâ€™d have the capability to coordinate last minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief.  This might be the most exciting element of owning our own vehicle.


<br>


<br>


One ride at a time, Do Good Bus can begin to shape Los Angeles into a more connected city; one with informed and inspired residents who can help one another.","We think the SMALL THINGS will mean success.  


<br>


<br>


In 2050, if most Los Angelenos know more than one neighbor and if kids donâ€™t roll their eyes when teachers say â€œvolunteerâ€ â€“ success.  


<br>


<br>


In 37 years, if people understand picking up a piece of trash is just as much their responsibility as the next personâ€™s â€“ success.


<br>


<br>


And on our way to 2050, if people have unique opportunities to connect and even have FUN together, they will be more likely to work together to make those small things Los Angelesâ€™s reality.


<br>


<br>


Success."
3102068,2013068,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MADEbyDWC.html,MADE by DWC: Education and Job Readiness for Homeless Women, Income & Employment,"Women experiencing homelessness face complex, intersecting barriers on their paths to personal stability. Since 1978, the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center (DWC) has been empowering women to break the cycles of homelessness and poverty by providing a wide array of services that can be tailored to each womanâ€™s needs. The recent economic downturn has shown an increased demand for income and employment opportunities, and women on Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row are no exception.





DWC, an agency that serves 4,300 homeless and extremely lowincome women annually, is meeting that need by expanding our comprehensive Education and Job Readiness Program to serve the complex income and employment needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely lowincome women.





With over three decades of experience, DWC is uniquely prepared to offer services for the hardest to employ women. Many of the women we serve may never be able to reenter the traditional workforce because of physical disabilities, mental health issues, ageing, or other barriers related to their experience of homelessness. Our programs allow these women to learn practical skills, gain a sense of purpose, and regain selfsustainability and earn income from alternative job opportunities.





Our Education and Job Readiness Program is made possible through DWCâ€™s onsite Learning Center, as well as our two MADE by DWC social enterprises, a cafÃ© and gift shop opened in April 2011, and a resale boutique that opened in November 2012. Both businesses offer handson job training opportunities, as well as support the local economy in downtown Los Angeles while inviting community members to engage in ending homelessness through socially conscious shopping.





SET to Create


In 2013, we are building on the initial successes of our SET to Create productdevelopment program allows participants to gain soft skills by participating in workshops, as they simultaneously gain practical skills in creating handcrafted products to industry standards. The MADE by DWC product line emphasizes sustainable goods and includes organic soaps and candles, jewelry, ornaments, and upcycled picture frames and bound journals. Women who complete an initial certification process are able to earn supplemental income, as DWC purchases their items for resale in our two stores.





SET to Work


With the recent opening of our second social enterprise, a resale boutique, we are able to offer even more handson jobtraining opportunities. This year, we are piloting an intensive 12week jobreadiness training program through both stores, which we will expand as we grow our businesses and community partners. SET to Work participants will develop marketable skills including inventory management, customer service, food handling, and administrative tasks. Each woman will receive oneonone case management to set goals and address housing, sustenance, and healthrelated needs. Program graduates will then be connected to employment opportunities, including exclusive externships and entrylevel positions designated by our growing network of corporate partners.





2013 Impact


Our Education and Job Readiness Program will impact LA2050â€™s Income and Employment indicator by improving literacy, job readiness, employment, and employment retention among homeless and lowincome women on downtown Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row. This year, DWC plans to engage 925 women in services through our Learning Center; launching SET to Work and scaling up our SET to Create workshops will allow us to provide paths out of homelessness and poverty for more women.





Our Holistic Approach


DWCâ€™s services and programs have been developed with an understanding that the women we serve continue to experience the barriers, trauma, and daily hardships correlated with homelessness and poverty. DWC is committed to meeting each womanâ€™s needs and to providing a safe haven where women can access the resources they need to remove these barriers.





All program participants have access to DWCâ€™s full spectrum of supportive services, offered through our Day Center on Skid Row. Along with basic needs such as showers, meals, and clothing, DWC provides individualized counseling and case management; a Learning Center offering a variety of courses and computer access; an onsite health clinic offering extensive medical and mental health services; and referrals to housing and local community resources. All programs are also open to residents who live in our 119 units of permanent supportive housing.","Over our 35year history, the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center has created innovative programming focused on meeting the unique needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely lowincome women. When the Center first opened in 1978, it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row.





In 1986, DWC opened the United Statesâ€™ first permanent supportive housing for women, a program that has since been modeled as a national prototype. DWC now offers 119 units of permanent supportive housing among our two Residences to women who are primarily elderly, mentally ill, and/or physically disabled. More than 95% of the 500 women we have served through our Residence program have remained permanently housed.





We have also scaled up our housing efforts beyond our own 119 apartments by piloting our Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model with clients housed offsite. Our CTI model, a proven evidencebased program launched in 2011, provides intensive case management for individuals transitioning out of chronic homelessness, ensuring that they have the support and access to resources they need to stay housed. DWC is also committed to sharing best practices; this April, our Director of Clinical Health Services and Lead CTI Case Manager will present DWC's CTI model at the Housing California Conference in Sacramento.





As the need on Skid Row has continued to grow, DWC is grateful that we have been able to expand our programming and services, offered through our Day Center, Learning Center, two Residence locations, and onsite Medical and Mental Health Center. In 2012, DWC served 4,300 women with 90,000 meals, 23,000 showers, and 6,500 case management and counseling sessions. 





Along with our direct service, DWC contributes to national and local policy discussions and to best practice research in service provision for people experiencing homelessness. In 2001, DWC spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition, addressing womenâ€™s policy and research needs. The coalition has since performed several needs assessments for women on Skid Row.





DWCâ€™s wellreputed history is a testament to our mission and work in the community. DWC received a Los Angeles Office of the City Attorney Commendation in 1993, a Bank of America Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Neighborhood Builder Award in 2007, and ""Organization of the Year"" by the Los Angeles Business Journal in 2011.





Several other organizations have utilized DWC as a prototype for creating services for homeless women, including Friends In Deed in Pasadena, and organizations in San Francisco, San Jose, Amarillo, Texas; and New Orleans.





Finally, we attribute our longterm success to the overwhelming community support and volunteer efforts that allow us to make the greatest impact with limited resources. DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement.","Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and other agencies who have provided support for our Education and Job Readiness Program through cash and inkind donations and pro bono consultation, as well as by carrying our product line. These partners include Bloomingdaleâ€™s; Hudson News; the Skirball Center; Munger, Tolles, & Olson; Yahoo!; Groundwork Coffee; and Chrysalis.





Other partners include our wide range of volunteers, including students, working professionals, retirees, and corporate groups. We have also engaged other Skid Row agencies to encourage referrals to our programs; these include LAMP, St. Vincentâ€™s, LA Christian Health Center, and JWCH Institute.","DWC measures both the total number of women accessing each of our services and the progress of individual participants. These numbers are audited on a monthly basis and used to determine our overall social impact.





Each woman we serve through our Education and Job Readiness Program will complete an initial assessment to capture a brief education and employment history and her related short and longterm goals. Participants will attend a oneonone counseling session to determine the next steps in their development path, as well as complete assessment tests in basic reading, math, and computer use.





Success for our Education and Job Readiness Program participants will be measured in relation to our Impact Metrics, which measure each individual womanâ€™s progress on the path to stability and her ability to end the cycle of homelessness in her life. Our measurement guide evaluates each womanâ€™s progress on a 5point scale to determine her success at meeting basic needs; accessing healthcare; accessing mental health services; achieving a sense of selfworth and purpose; building a social network; and maintaining a reliable source of income. Additionally, we consider a womanâ€™s access to a safe, permanent home. The measurement guides are implemented when a woman first accesses services, and are administered each six months by case managers and other program staff. 





To track our metrics, DWC developed an outcome database to record and analyze these performance measures. These metrics reflect DWCâ€™s service model of reducing barriers to personal stability, which is an essential component of success for women in homelessness looking to reenter the workforce.





In 2013, we plan to engage 925 women in services offered within our Learning Center. Of these, 225 women will engage in the Education and Job Readiness Program, and 75% will complete their assessed learning level and progress to the subsequent level. Our pilot SET to Work program will engage 54 women in the intensive 12week intensive curriculum, providing jobreadiness training, vocational education, and oneonone case management.  


We will evaluate program success throughout this year with our initial cohort of 54 women, with the intention to improve and expand impact each year.





This year, we will offer SET to Create productdevelopment 700 workshops, engaging 140 women in learning practical and soft skills. Of the 140 participants, 90% will attend at least four workshops and receive income from their crafted products.





In addition to evaluating program outcomes, we will continue refining our business models for our two MADE by DWC social enterprises. As with any new venture, we will continue to test products in the market, form new sales relationships with businesses and online channels, and grow our local customer base. These business expansions will allow us to continue scaling our Education and Job Readiness Program to reach more women.","DWCâ€™s mission is to provide permanent supportive housing and a safe and healthy community fostering dignity, respect, and personal stability, and to advocate ending homelessness for women. Los Angeles is currently the homeless capital of the United States; the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agencyâ€™s 2011 count found more than 50,000 homeless individuals in LA County, with a high concentration of those individuals on Skid Row. Onethird of these homeless individuals are adult women.





Our Education and Job Readiness Program is a direct response to the service barriers and gaps that directly impact Los Angelesâ€™ homeless and extremely lowincome women. According to a 2010 Women's Needs Assessment, the Skid Row community has an extreme lack of accessible education and employment opportunities.





Among women surveyed, 68.2% lacked a high school diploma or GED equivalent, and only 7.6% had college degrees, the lowest level since the surveyâ€™s creation in 2001. Nearly half (46.9%) lacked access to computer classes and/or internet, and 59.4% of women identified educational opportunities as a resource they would most like to see in local community and service centers. Of women surveyed, 90.3% did not believe there were employment opportunities available in the downtown area, and only 4.3% reported income from employment.





Women in homelessness are often thrust into instability as a direct result of poor physical and/or mental health, disability, loss of employment, and familial loss, among other issues. As federal funding for affordable housing and social programs faces further cuts, we are investing efforts into providing women with practical skills and alternative income to increase their longterm independence. 





Our Education and Job Readiness Program will influence the personal wellness and stability of Los Angelesâ€™ most underserved population, while also impacting the wellbeing of our local community on multiple levels. We will (1) increase direct access to jobtraining and employment services (2) ensure stabilization of our participants, assisting them in building skills and reentering the workforce, (3) reduce utilization and decrease dependency on highcost emergency services, (4) mobilize the Los Angeles community through volunteerism and the shopping experience, and (5) improve the overall social, economic, and health outcomes on Skid Row.





In addition to providing direct benefits to homeless women, DWCâ€™s programs engage members of the greater Los Angeles community. Volunteers lead many of our SET to Create productdevelopment workshops, offering both practical skills and mentorship to participants. Our two MADE by DWC stores bring in foot traffic and engage our neighbors in the local economy. Additionally, the MADE by DWC product line is offered through several locations across Los Angeles, including Bloomingdaleâ€™s in Century City, and several Hudson News locations at LAX, expanding the scope of our public education efforts.","DWCâ€™s vision of success in 2050 is an end to homelessness through innovation and crossfunctional services. While our grant proposal specifically addresses the Income and Employment indicator, we recognize that the causes and effects of homelessness reach across several of the indicators outlined in the LA2050 report. Our Education and Job Readiness Program is just one of the ways in which the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center provides a pathway out of homelessness; our holistic approach is focused on removing multiple intersecting barriers that women in homelessness and extreme poverty may face.





We envision a Los Angeles where all women can access the resources they need to establish and maintain her personal stability. In terms of income and employment, our Education and Job Readiness Program is designed to ensure that all women who are interested in participating in the local economy have opportunities to do so, whether through reentry into the traditional workforce or, for those who face extreme barriers, through alternative income opportunities. The collaborative, supportive environment we promote in our SET to Create and SET to Work workshops will provide a place where women can earn an income, break out of the isolation of homelessness, contribute to the local community, and gain a sense of fulfillment.





In addition to striving to improve outcomes for homeless and lowincome women as a direct service provider, the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center also engages in advocacy efforts to increase affordable and permanent supportive housing options and ensure that fewer individuals are becoming homeless for the first time. Because of that, we consider success in the year 2050 for the Income and Employment indicator as closely linked to the Housing and Social Connectedness indicators, as well. 





As a service enterprise that engages more than 2,500 individuals in volunteerism each year, we recognize that it takes the support of the entire community to achieve our vision of a Los Angeles where all individuals have access to housing, healthcare, and employment. As we work to achieve our goals, however, we see the need for employment programs that take into account the unique employment challenges that homeless and formerly homeless women face.





Our two social enterprise stores, our cafÃ© and resale boutique, provide spaces where women experiencing physical and mental health barriers are able to gain hard and soft skills, whether to enter the work force or to develop alternative streams of income to support their efforts to regain personal stability. Beyond impact in Los Angeles, we seek to end homelessness for all women, and as such, we envision that by 2050 our model and best practices will be leveraged by other communities across the nation."
3102069,2013069,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Moebius5000.html,The Moebius Incubator: A New Step for L.A.s Entrepeneurs, Income & Employment,"<p>The Moebius Incubator is a startup incubator based in Los Angeles with two aims: to dive deep into the problems of making great products and to make companies that are both profitable and socially beneficial. Our dream is to seed a new culture of entrepreneurship.</p>








<p>L.A. is currently rated 3rd in the world for startups (as seen in the Startup Ecosystem Report: http://reports.startupcompass.co/StartupEcosystemReportPart1v1.2.pdf). We aim to leverage this strength in order to address the problems of employment and income disparity L.A. faces. The Moebius Incubator attempts to innovate on the incubation cycle, and in so doing make entrepreneurship more socially relevant and available as a career to a broader pool of people. </p>








<p>Our first innovation is to directly tackle the problems of making great products: namely engineering and design. Many incubators currently rely on the talents of their participants to develop great products. We believe we can support entrepreneurs in this process. Both research and traditional wisdom indicate that projectbased and contextual learning goes the deepest and lasts the longest. We propose a model of incubation which provides not only support for traditional business development but also engineering and design.</p>








<p>We aim to do this in two ways. One is to develop a best practices model: what work out there is most relevant to the engineering and design experience in 2013? By establishing a canon of the best design â€” from the revered practices of Edward Tufte to the contemporary practices of Bret Victor â€” as well as the best engineering â€” ranging from the new wave of realtime frameworks such as Meteor.JS to the visionary work of computing legend and Los Angeles based Alan Kay â€” we believe we can give our entrepreneurs a strong starting point to work in the information economy.</p>








<p>Secondly, we aim to hire in our incubator a design and engineering coach to provide weekly support and mentorship for projects. By shifting away from a class based model and to a projectbased model, we adapt what we have seen to work in the best K12 education (such as San Diegoâ€™s High Tech High) to the entrepreneurial space. We will also have a business mentor â€” recognizing the depth of service incubators currently provide in shaping business plans and facilitating hardtofind connections to investors. </p>








<p>Our other major innovation as an incubator is to select companies along two metrics: profitability and social good. We deeply believe that the most profitable work will be the work which helps individuals, families, and cultures grow. Apple has been a testament to the profitability of beautiful design. We seek to expand on their vision and look for other opportunities where human development â€” be it individual or cultural â€” and entrepreneurship can be aligned. </p>








<p>The question of evaluating socially meaningful work and having it survive the necessary pivots of business will be a challenge. We draw inspiration from organizations like Givewell.org that through a research based approach we can understand what truly will help our society and shape our companies accordingly. While this work â€” of evaluating companies for social good â€” will be a continued research process, we believe signs like the UN ratification of the triple bottom line in 2007 show that we are ready for the development of further metrics for business success alongside the classical revenue and profit based metrics.</p>








<p>Logistically, we aim to host our first class from late September to December of 2013, using the grant funding to run operational costs. We aim to raise seed funding for the companies separately. May to September will be spent interviewing candidates, researching best practices in engineering, design, and incubation, and hiring mentors for the launch.</p>








<p>Our short time line will let us see how viable this model is quickly. Our dreams are to find the momentum to seed a new culture of innovation in Los Angeles â€” one with itâ€™s own clear and unique character. We believe that entrepreneurship can grow in two ways: by becoming a force in the care of our city on all fronts, and by becoming a career path that a wide swath of people see as viable for themselves. Our strategy â€” to support the growth of entrepreneurs on all fronts and to engage a second social metric as a requirement for success â€” aims to provide the roots required. We believe that in 2050 entrepreneurship is something Los Angeles can look at with gratitude for both what is has done for us as well as who it lets all of us become.</p>





","<p>Droplabs succesfully provided a communitybased education center to the community with all services being at no or low cost. Our prime acheievements have been:</p>








<p>* Barnraisings: We have hosted barnraisings where 15 âˆ’ 20 community members get together to provide a day of web development for a nonprofit or community member. See http://droplabs.net/news/barnraisingandcodesprintatdroplabsunitingthedrupalandtimebankingcommunities</p>








<p>* Lowcost coworking space: We offer fulltime access to our space at $150 / month, a quarter of the price of competing spaces. This is one contribution to creating a diverse socioeconomic tech community.</p>








<p>* Consensusbased organizing: We operate by allowing all full members to have a voice in the direction and organization of Droplabs.</p>








<p>* Communityaccess education: All our classes are low or no cost and have ranged from a focus on web and technology to classes about cooking and Korean culture.</p>","<p>We seek to build off Los Angelesâ€™ existing entrepreneurial ecosystem and bring it a new perspective. To start weâ€™ve partnered with:</p>








<p>* Santa Monica New Tech (http://www.meetup.com/SantaMonicaNewTech/) , a startup meetup that has 250 âˆ’ 300 people in attendance monthly, as a forum for our participants to pitch, get feedback, and meet the tech community.</p><p>* Quantified Self Los Angeles (http://www.meetup.com/QuantifiedSelfLA/) â€” a user group in the new space of personal & digital health â€” to understand how we can best contribute to those spaces.</p>








* Meteor LA (http://www.meetup.com/MeteorLA/) â€” a user group for one of the webâ€™s latest realtime application frameworks â€” to support our engineering and design fronts.","<p>Our project will have a very concrete outcome: at the end of our incubatorâ€™s first class, concluding at the end of 2013, we will evaluate project success by looking at the question: â€œHow have our businesses fared?â€ As our mission is to be explicit about building business that are both profitable as well as socially beneficial, we plan to evaluate both. Models such as the triple bottomline (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line) serve as inspiration for us. To start, weâ€™ll use a fourpart rubric, covering our pedagogy (engineering and design success) and our mission (financial and social success)</p>














<p>1. Engineering success: </p>








<p>* Has the company been able to produce a working demo? </p>





<p>* If not, are they on there way there, or have they had critical problems in the engineering of their technology? </p>





<p>* If they have had critical problems, was there something we could have done better to help them solve this issue? (i.e. Team failure or incubator failure?)</p>








<p>2. Design success:</p> 





<p>* Has the company been able to produce a clear and viable idea?</p> 





<p>* Can someone outside of the tech world understand their idea?</p> 





<p>* Do they have evidence that their target audience does indeed want to use their product?</p><p>* If not, was it a problem of graphic, interface, or experience design?</p><p>* If the product is undesirable or unusable, could we have helped at a key juncture?</p><p>3. Financial success: </p><p>* If the company wants to move forward, do they have funding for continuing their discovery phase / moving into the validation phase? </p><p>* Are they connected with investors such that a further seed round, a Series A, or other financial support is in sight? </p><p>* If not, is it because of lack of business development work, lack of clear communication about the product, or  a core product issue?</p><p>* If itâ€™s a business issue, could it have been averted?</p><p>4. Social success:</p><p>* Does the company have a socially relevant mission?</p><p>* Does their product pursue that mission in a clear and obvious way?</p>* If the company has to pivot, do we expect the mission to grow with it, based on the teamâ€™s work so far?





* How many people will be affected by their work, and is there a clear and validated plan as to what change they will bring?





* If not, why? Is it an issue of the domain they are in, the strategy they undertook, or the execution of that strategy?





* If the mission has gotten lost, what resources can we provide to reconnect to it?





Using this four part rubric, we support our larger strategy: support the growth of jobs and companies in a unique entrepreneurial context in Los Angeles. By having successful and socially relevant companies we aim to concretely build more jobs in Los Angeles at the rate of 10 companies by the end of 2013, and in the long term shift the culture of entrepreneurship to one that becomes more universally accessible.











","<p>We aim to improve L.A. by building on of one of L.Aâ€™s bright spots in the employment & income sector: itâ€™s startup scene. LA is rated as the 3rd best place in the world to start a company (see Startup Ecosystem Report: http://reports.startupcompass.co/StartupEcosystemReportPart1v1.2.pdf), with its two weaknesses as support for entrepreneurship and the mindset for it. L.A. is well established as a haven of production talent and investment capital due largely to its relationship with Hollywood. The question becomes: how to leverage these natural strengths for the greater good of L.A.?</p>








<p>We believe that entrepreneurship can become the new familyrun business. As the information economy allows businesses to reach unprecedented scales, we see a potential for largescale business to flourish here. The strong culture of familyrun and immigrantled businesses show that L.A. has been a great boon to individuals with drive. Our incubator, by explicitly engaging the design and engineering pieces needed to work in the information economy, aims to make develop entrepreneurship as a career path available to all  â€” not just those primed for it. We believe that entrepreneurship can be a leveling force agains the great socioeconomic disparity present in L.A., by opening up a path to all that yields both personal financial reward as well as strong support for the local economy. </p>








<p>Our first project aims to start 10 new companies in Los Angeles. With success, our incubator will run a spring and fall round in 2014, continuing that rate. We estimate our companies will grow by an average of 15 people in their first 2 years and 50 in their first 5 (based on the Ecosystem Report.) Assuming an 80% success rate of initial funding seen in Los Angeles by incubators such as LaunchpadLA, we expect to seed an incremental increase in jobs available over the next 5 years. Our hope is to add jobs â€” a projected 150 companies over 7 years with a total of 3,000 employees â€” as well as the contribution to a culture which can identify its own needs and turn them into its own jobs, addressing both the symptoms and the roots of the problem.</p>","Our hope would be that success in 2050 would be visible in three ways: 











<p>1. A measurably and obviously more diverse entrepreneurial pool. Right now there is a heavy bias towards male entrepreneurs from the middleclass and higher. With an incubator that focuses on building civic and purposedriven missions, we expect to attract talent from all walks of life, who have specific missions they want to bring to life via entrepreneurship.</p>











<p>2. LA as an entrepreneurial hub in its own right. As mentioned above, LA is 3rd in the world for entrepreneurship, but still all entrepreneurial hubs are benchmarked and compared negatively against Silicon Valley. We believe that a socially driven incubator will be a step towards a differentiation of L.A.â€™S own scene apart from Silicon Valleyâ€™s. In 2050 weâ€™d like people to know L.A. for its particular entrepreneurial character as well as for its other industries.</p>














<p>3. Enough jobs and businesses thriving from these programs to see a measurable impact on unemployment. We believe that a needs and values driven entrepreneurship culture can begin to address the feedback loop between cultural and social issues and unemployment. When we can find ways to solve our local problems with entrepreneurship, we create jobs and our city as a whole gets stronger. By being a catalyst in this process, we aim to be one of many factors in bringing L.A. From 2 âˆ’ 3 percentage points above the national average to that many points below it. </p>"

<strong>IMPACT:</strong>


<br>


Through our actions we hope to spark inspiration within the Los Angeles community and beyond.  Sound Share LA will serve as a living document of vibrant creativity from our inspiring city, telling the story of LA's diverse sonic heritage and providing a platform for the tales yet untold.  ","dublab has been broadcasting since 1999. More than 300,000 international listeners connect to our audio streams and podcasts monthly.  Over the past 14 years dublab.com has been critically acclaimed as one of the premier Internet radio stations in the world.  The LA Weekly says, ""Tuning into the Dubstream at any given time is a music loverâ€™s dream.""  dublab is part of Los Angelesâ€™ cultural landscape and continues to create innovative music programming that provides an important voice to the city.  


<br>


<br>


Besides its radio programming, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles.  We have curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and 2013 marks our third year presenting a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series.  Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles.  


<br>


<br>


dublab has succeeded as a community supported organization funded through contributions and underwriting from individual donors and organizations from around the world.  In 2011 dublab became the recipient of multiyear grant funding from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and the following year received a grant from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.  Its longevity is in great part due to the organizationâ€™s successful fundraising strategy and financial stability.

We will invite a wide array of collaborators, ranging from pioneering elders to influential, up and coming musicians to participate in the community radio broadcasts .  Prominent journalists and historians will moderate the live discussions and produce features for the website.


<br>


<br>


We will expand the impact of the project by collaborating with major arts institutions, cultural centers, music venues and media outlets.  In addition, we will actively encourage participation of web developers, leading to the creation of third party mobile apps, multimedia art installations and more.","The Sound Share LA initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics:


<br>


<br>


<strong>PUBLIC FEEDBACK:</strong>


<br>


To evaluate the response from the public, an email survey will be conducted with participants at the end of the projectâ€™s first year.  Feedback given by the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from event staff.


<br>


<br>


<strong>MEDIA RESPONSE:</strong>


<br>


Press received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion.  Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event will be considered a success.  We will also take into account the depth of social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers gained.


<br>


<br>


<strong>NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:</strong>


<br>


We will collect website statistics, such as number of unique visitors and listeners.  In order to consider the project successful, web traffic must be comparable to equivalent online media platforms.  Attendance figures and live tuneins for each community broadcast event will also be recorded.  These statistics should expand as the project develops.


<br>


<br>


<strong>PROGRAM QUALITY:</strong>


<br>


The staff will conduct a review at the end of each community broadcast event to evaluate its success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of engagement.  At the end of the first year of programming we will determine if the quality of the project's web presence and live broadcasts across Los Angeles County successfully fulfilled the initiativeâ€™s goals.","The Sound Share LA initiative will have a positive and lasting impact on Los Angeles by:





 Educating current and future generations by providing free access to the Sound Share LA website featuring exclusive content including hundreds of interviews, performances, DJ mixes and films. 





  Enhancing education, research and stimulation of tourism by creating a geotagged content map and searchable content database, organized by musician, year, neighborhood and genre.


 


 Increasing community awareness of the city's cultural heritage, history and value.





 Providing the opportunity for residents to engage with local musicians in a live setting.





 Educating listeners around the world about Los Angelesâ€™ diverse musical contributions. 





The monthly community radio broadcasts will have an immediate impact within the neighborhoods where they occur.  The public will come together to explore notable LA music phases in the very spaces these genres thrived.  Audiences will enjoy a full day of free programming giving them rare insight into the people and places behind these influential music developments: 1950â€™s Central Avenue jazz scene, 1960â€™s Sunset Strip music revolution, 1970â€™s Laurel Canyon folk movement, 1980â€™s downtown punk rock explosion or 1990â€™s South Central rap uprising among many others.  





Oral histories from the pioneers who forged these music movements will be shared alongside input from the generations who followed in their footsteps.  DJ sets and performances will bring the music genres to life.  Attendees and those accessing the radio broadcasts will learn about the musical heritage of specific LA neighborhoods.  This experience will educate them about truly unique music breakthroughs from Los Angeles.  Eventually these radio shows will have a long term impact as they are made available as online archives.





The Sound Share LA project will have a direct impact on the arts and cultural vitality of Los Angeles by creating an ongoing document of not only the past but also contemporary music made in Los Angeles.  The Sound Share LA website, in combination with quality live events staged throughout Los Angeles, will expose residents to the rich heritage in every corner of our expansive city.","Los Angeles has long been known as a launchpad for progress, helping advance international culture through innovation.  In the year 2050, Los Angeles will be the undisputed cultural capital of the world.  It will be the space where sea change takes form and launches across the globe.

<br>


LA 2050 will brim with diverse, artistic voices who feel empowered to better their community through creative energy.  They will be a populace of philanthropists for whom giving comes as second nature.  These informed citizens will have shaped a government that guides the city with empathy and knowledge, finding creative solutions for the issues that impact its residents.  The seeds of forward thinking will have been cultivated through an education system that encourages artistic action as central to productive living.  


<br>


<br>


This conscious city will celebrate its wide cultural spectrum.  By 2050, artists of all walks should enjoy an abundance of opportunities to make a living through their craft.  Media outlets will offer an expansive view of the arts, blurring the line between mainstream and underground.  Citizens along with a plethora of neighborhood based arts organizations will participate in the daily conversation of evolving culture.  Through the collective energy of a healthy, happy and inspired population, Los Angeles will continue to serve as a beacon to the world.  Sound Share LA will help materialize this optimistic vision of a creative Los Angeles in the year 2050 and beyond."

3102072,2013072,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/theyachtclub.html,Dodgeball Prosperity and the Common Good, Health,"<p>During our journey, The Yacht Club has seemingly stumbled upon a way to completely reimagine the traditional nonprofit model in a way that potentially solves one of the greatest struggles in the nonprofit sector: How do we motivate people to volunteer?</p>


<p>It turns out...itâ€™s dodgeball.</p>


<p>The Yacht Club utilizes the nostalgia of dodgeball to reinvigorate struggling city parks while providing tailor made youth programming to the children of the surrounding community  Our idea is to expand our efforts & programming to 3 additional LA City Rec & Parks centers in the disadvantaged neighborhoods of LA.</p>


<p>We started The Yacht Club as a social experiment in 2008. Once a week, we would ask dodgeballdeprived Angelenos to complete a different philanthropic task in exchange for an hour or two of (slightly) organized dodgeball. Theyâ€™d swing by a drugstore as they made their way to the Highland Park Rec Center to pick up a toothbrush, box of tampons, or any other needed item. By the end of the two hour dodgeball workout, weâ€™d have a bag full of goodies to drop off at any number of local charities (the Downtown Womenâ€™s Shelter, Humane Society, LA Food Bank & others). It was our way of doing a little good while having a little fun.</p>


<p>As The Yacht Clubâ€™s vision became clearer, our efforts to achieve the common good followed suit. We began to focus our attention on the kids at these parks whose programs were being slashed due to budget cuts. Now, we began asking these same dodgeball players to hide eggs on Easter, to hand out toys with Santa on Christmas, & to spend their Friday nights playing dodgeball with kids. Suddenly, three years had blown by when we received a letter from the IRSâ€¦</p>


<p>""Dear Applicant: We are pleased to inform you that upon review of your application for tax exempt status,  we have determined that you are exempt from Federal income tax under under section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Codeâ€¦""</p>


<p>Sure, we were excited, but this would mean that The Yacht Club would need to evolve.  So we assembled a Board of Directors, acquired an office, & got to work.</p>


<p>Now, as we head into our 5th year, we bring roughly 500 adults and 100 kids into LA City Rec & Parks centers each week with chapters in Glassell Park, Venice, & North Hollywood.  In addition to their donation of time and goods, participant league fees received from the adult dodgeball pay for permit fees, equipment and helps fund our customized kids programs. Using the resources from our adult league participants, every week, we use the game of dodgeball to significantly impact at least 6 of LA2050's 8 indicators:</p>


<p>1. Health: The Yacht Club uses dodgeball to encourage kids and adults to run, jump, duck, throw, catch, block, laugh, smile and banter for a couple of hours each week. </p>


In addition, The Yacht Club chapters in Venice & Glassell Park partnered with Whole Foods to create Yacht Grub â€“ a free cooking class for kids that focuses on the education & benefits of healthy eating.</p>


<p>2. Education: Once we've used kidâ€™s dodgeball to establish relationships & build trust with our kids, we work with LA City Rec & Parksâ€™ staff & coordinators to create workshops & classes designed to bridge the gap between traditional schooling & extracurricular activities. We focus on critical thinking & artistic expression through photography and kids cooking & gardening workshops.</p>


<p>3. Social Connectedness: Whether itâ€™s kids or adults, dodgeball plays a key part in the development of the social skills necessary to become a productive and proactive part of our communities.  We're working to create a muchneeded social outlet for kids and young professionals by providing opportunities to get involved in their local community, to forge new relationships & to volunteer in unique ways that directly benefit their neighborhood.</p>


<p>4. Public Safety:  The Yacht Club changes the perceptions of our communities by creating safe, alternative spaces for kids to spend their time.  The work we do encourages positive experiences & interactions in LA City Parks & Rec centers.</p>


<p>5. Environmental Quality:  The Yacht Club increases access to open spaces & parks by creating positive experiences & maximizing utilization of LA City Rec & Parks centers.  Additionally, we introduce our participants to community gardens in the areas served.</p>


<p>6. Arts & Cultural Vitality: Cultural and artistic activities run rampant in our programs. For example, Yacht Pix is a pilot program in our Venice chapter that puts cameras in the hands of teens. This scavenger huntstyle class aims to teach basic photography skills, to encourage critical thinking, & to help kids expand their artistic talents.


This winning formula creates a catalyst for real change in the youth & communities of LA & a grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation & Good Worldwide will enable us to expand our efforts to 3  additional parks by the end of 2013.</p>","<p>To date, The Yacht Club has successfully transformed 500+ dodgeball players into engaged, sociallyconscious Angelenos by creating a diverse number of opportunities for participants to volunteer directly in their communities, in addition to adding roughly 1300+ hours of physical activity for kids and adults.  This has been achieved through the following programming efforts:</p>


<p>Creative Fundraising: One example would be our 3rd Annual Valentine's Day Tournament. We worked with private local and national companies to create a unique themed event. This was an incredibly successful fundraising effort with proceeds going towards ongoing activities for kids, including Kids dodgeball, Yacht Grub, Yacht Plot, Yacht Pix and forthcoming programs.</p>


<p>Kids Dodgeball: Friday nights from 7:309 PM: Continuing our efforts to create positive experiences & growth for the youth of Glassell Park & Venice (& starting the program this spring in North Hollywood), we host our Kids Dodgeball League on Friday nights. This program was started under the Mayor's Summer Night Lights initiative over two years ago, which we used as a platform to gauge interest & create an ongoing program. We are very proud that this informal league has helped us build relationships with kids in the neighborhood, which has furthered our ability to create new efforts & programs.</p>


<p>Yacht Plot:  We have firmly planted ourselves in a new spot in Glassell Park  The Drew St. Community Garden. The Yacht Club volunteers, along with helpful neighborhood kids, maintain the garden a few times each weekroutinely watering, weeding, tidying up, monitoring plant growth, & dealing with challenges presented by seasonal change. Once mature, the plotâ€™s produce will supplement the culinary needs of the Yacht Grub kids cooking class. To assist in supplementing the needs of our gardening crew, our adult dodgeball league rallied & donated our wish list of kid's gardening tools.</p>


<p>Kids Cooking Classes: In 2012, we formed Yacht Grub in collaboration with Whole Foods, creating a cooking & nutrition class for atriskteens associated with recreation centers in Venice & Glassell Park. The goal of this six week course is to give students confidence in the kitchen while they learn healthy cooking, practical nutrition information, basic knife skills & complete awareness of how to read ingredient labels. 810 students learn two new recipes each week in this 2 hour class.</p>


<p>Yacht Pix, an introduction to photography course for kids at the Oakwood Rec Center in Venice. The goal of the class is to learn a variety of techniques & ways of shooting, honing the studentsâ€™ critical thinking skills. Guest photographers showcase their work, allowing students to see how photography can be a profession. At the end of the session, the students work is hung for a â€˜gallery openingâ€™ where one photo is chosen as the winner based on skills learned, directions followed, & positive behavior displayed.</p>","<p>LA Department of Recreation & Parks:


Directors & staff are vital partners in our project  their commitment & understanding of the impact we can have at the parks & communities are essential to our success. We work to identify & define the specific needs of each park, funneling resources & volunteers to reach those goals.</p>


<p>Teachers, Stakeholders, Community Leaders & City Officials:


Our leadership teams work with community leaders & educators to establish common goals & collaborate on solving specific problems in the neighborhoods we serve. i.e., due to budget shortfalls, the Glassell Park Community Pool had been slated for closure in the fall of 2012. Our local chapter worked to ensure the pool stayed open year round.</p>","<p>Currently our growth and success is built on word of mouth. The Yacht Club started with 10 players and volunteers and has grown to nearly 500, all from players encouraging friends and strangers to get involved. By people continuing to step up through our adult programming and get involved in The Yacht Club, their desire to take the helm and start new projects that benefit their community is one measurement of success.</p>





<p>Success will also be measured by our ability to address specific needs of Los Angeles parks. For instance, in the summer of 2012, The Yacht Club launched our Quick and Dirty dodgeball series, the goal of which was to identify a specific problem at a local recreation center, host a one day tournament to raise funds and donate to the cause. To date, we raised funds for the following causes:</p>





<p>â€¢ $800 to send 7 lowincome kids to summer camp at Oakwood Rec in Venice. 


â€¢ $800 for the Save Glassell Pool campaign


â€¢ $800 to ensure the Glassell rec center stays open on Sundays


â€¢ $750 to make much needed repairs to the North Hollywood Rec Centerâ€™s gym floors.</p>





<p>Another major indicator of our success will be the retention and return rate for program participants. Success will come in both large and small forms. Whether a child returns to Yacht Grub for example, continues their culinary education, encourages others to do so or potentially sparking interest in what could become a profession would all be monumental measures of success.</p>





<p>Some of these pilot programs are less than a year old, so retention and recidivism are still being analyzed, but to date we've noticed that 75% of kids who began these programs have returned on a regular basis. The hope is to increase both the raw number of local children participating in the program by offering a more diverse array of classes and to maximize our retention rate by perfecting the instruction models we have begun.</p>





<p>Weâ€™ll also use the feedback we receive from our partners, community leaders, and kids in our programs to identify our strengths and weaknesses and grow a stronger Yacht Club.</p>","We believe a more physically active Los Angeles means a healthier Los Angeles, but exercise is just one of many benefits and advantages The Yacht Club can bring to the neighborhoods that need it most. We also offer a safe and fun place for kids to hangout by creating positive experiences and engaging activities, helping LA City Rec and Parks centers to become a living and breathing part of the community and a focal point for those living within it. Additionally, the art and educational programs we offer are designed to build vital skills that enhance human development, such as: confidence, critical thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit, which studies show results in more engaged young people that are more likely to avoid the juvenile court system, stay in school, and even go to college. 





In addition to health benefits, The Yacht Club offers Los Angeles a host of other benefits, from improved public safety and social connectedness to environmental quality. While many people living in Los Angeles have the desire and the good intentions to get out and help their community, many feel so removed from the problem that they donâ€™t ever rustle up the determination to get involved. The Yacht Club has developed a system to draw them into the LA City Rec and Parks centers to understand the need, to experience the sense of community, and to engage in a movement of change, ultimately creating a sense of investment in their own neighborhoods  weâ€™re shedding light on how vital it is that participants get involved in shaping our surroundings.


","<p>By 2050, we hope that there will be a drastic reduction in the rates of obesity in our communities.  We hope the kids in our program have retained a lifelong commitment to exercise, nutrition, civic engagement and volunteerism. Additionally, we hope they have led by example and their kids will also have lifelong commitments to the same.  We hope that The Yacht Club will teach them to also be educators  leading  the classes they used to be students in, understanding and pushing for the skills that were so pivotal in shaping them into adulthood. Their own children will be helping to shape new programs at LA City Rec and Parks centers which have, once again, become the touchstones of our communities  the place where neighbors meet, kids play, and communities grow together.</p>





<p>The importance of fostering healthy, productive, civicminded youth will mean that services are being added to LA City Rec and Parks programs instead of taking them away. In our vision for 2050, The Yacht Clubâ€™s programs will be present in every LA City Rec and Parks center in Los Angeles, engaging kids and adults as productive and active community members.  The Yacht Clubâ€™s comprehensive programs   Yacht Plot, Yacht Grub, Yacht Pix, Dodgeball, and the other programs we have the capacity to develop  will become part of Los Angelesâ€™ vernacular, and funding for these programs will be automatically included in the Mayorâ€™s budget as part of a comprehensive program to address the health of Angelenos. The desire to solve health problems with a single pill will be longgone, and conventional wisdom will be clear â€“ not only are exercise and diet key to living a long happy life, but the internal sense of selfworth and accomplishment that comes from giving back to your community through volunteerism is paramount to your overall health.</p>"
3102073,2013073,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/streetvendors.html,LA Street Vendors: A Better Economy through LowIncome Entrepreneurs, Income & Employment,"<p>Though recognized for its street food scene, Los Angeles is the only city of the 10 largest cities in the US that does not have formal regulations around street vending. Street vending, as a widespread practice, is simply illegal. Vendors can be fined up to $1,000, be jailed for 6 months, and have their cartsâ€”their entire businessâ€”confiscated. This is bad for business, bad for customers, and bad for families.</p>





<p>East LA Community Corporation (ELACC) and Leadership for Urban Renewal Now (LURN) will expand income and employment for lowincome Angelenos and small business owners through the Los Angeles Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs  Initiative or LASSEI.  LASSEI will promote partnerships between  businesses and street vendors, start a venture capital fund that will provide working capital that will help support the growth of LAâ€™s approximately 10,000 street vendors.  By 2050, LA will decriminalize street and sidewalk vending integrate them into LAâ€™s social and cultural life, providing Angelenos with affordable, convenient and healthy retail options. A developed pathway to success will allow a vendor to begin as an offstreet market entrepreneur and end up as a fixed stall, certified farmers market retailer, or commercial tenant.</p>





<p>Politically, the support of established businesses is crucial to bring a policy change to the city. In this next year, the Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs Initiative will:</p>


 


<p>1. Build support for street vendors among brickandmortar businesses along major commercial corridors in Los Angeles;</p>





<p>2. Bring street vendors and local businesses to the same table in order to better support one another through listening and stakeholder sessions such as ELACCâ€™s Policy con Pan Dulce and LURNâ€™s PLUS2 conferences;</p>





<p>3. Create a venture capital fund for lowincome entrepreneurs to allow street vendors to grow and further legitimize their businesses.</p>


 


<p>With these pieces in place, we expect to see:</p>





<p>1. A Citywide policy that supports street vendors, created in partnership with existing brickandmortar businesses who would benefit from street vendors  marketing their businesses to pedestrians and passersby;</p>





<p>2. Closer coordination between businesses and vendors that increase profits for all involved;</p>





<p>3. A â€œVenture Capital for the â€˜Hoodâ€ program that provides street vendors technical assistance and equity that allows them to scale their businesses and grow their bottom line.</p>


 


<p>ELACC and LURN believe this is a tremendous opportunity for the City to transform lowincome business corridors and lift thousands of people out of poverty and unemployment through profits from vending as a source of household income. An IBISWorld Market Research Report identifies street vending as a national growth industry, with $1 billion in revenue and 8.4% annual growth between 2008 and 2012. Street vending creates employment and income opportunities for immigrant families with little startup capital and low prospects in the formal sector. For many, street vending is the only way to legitimately take care of their families, break the cycle of poverty, and meet the demand for food in these communities.</p>


 


<p>The process for becoming licensed as a street vendor in Los Angeles is close to impossible to complete since there are many agencies to deal with and too many requirements that close opportunities to vendors. The best way to improve income and employment for these families is to give them the tools they need to legitimize their activities in the underground economy and formalize their businesses. And the only way to achieve this legislative change is through a â€˜winwinâ€™ partnership between street vendors and established brickandmortar businesses.</p>","<p>ELACC has been serving the Eastside of Los Angeles since 1995. On an annual basis, we provide affordable housing, community services, community organizing, and wealth building services to over 2,000 residents. ELACCâ€™s track record includes leveraging over $135 million of investment to the Eastside and housing over 1,000 residents in safe, habitable, and affordable housing throughout East Los Angeles. We mobilize a Community Organizing base of over 1,300 members annually, and have helped over 3,000 families to purchase their first homes, avoid foreclosure, establish savings, and build and sustain wealth.</p>





<p>ELACC, community residents, and partner organizations have now come together to form the â€œLos Angeles Street Vending Campaignâ€ to push the Los Angeles City Council to implement a policy that will provide a licensing process for vendors to sell foods without the fear criminalization.  The coalition has already conducted numerous town halls throughout Los Angeles neighborhoods where there is a high concentration of street vendors, in order to begin educating and engaging them on what the Cityâ€™s first comprehensive vending policy could look like.</p>","ELACCâ€™s main partners in the LA Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs Initiative is Leadership for Urban Renewal (LURN). LURN is dedicated to building community capital through advocacy, innovative community development strategies, and advisory services for change agents. LURN has been a leader in the Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign and has been an important partner in researching the conditions of street vendors in the City, and designing financial products that meet their needs. Together, ELACC and LURN will work on developing policy and a sustainable system that supports lowincome entrepreneurs that contribute to the economy and a better City in the year 2050.





More information on LURN at their website: http://www.lurnnetwork.org/","<p>The LA Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs Initiative will continuously evaluate its activities to ensure it is meeting its goals. Success will look like:</p>





<p>â€¢ Direct engagement with over 250 businesses around street vending, including providing material and invitation to attend mixer events. Measured by reviewing â€˜street teamâ€™ organizer calendars and reports of field action.</p>





<p>â€¢ Building connections between at least 50 vendors and small businesses. Measured by taking participant lists in at least two mixer events (such as Policy con Pan Dulce or Plus2) and conducting brief oneonone followup interviews with at least 10 vendors to assess new connections and improve future events to better foster cooperation.</p>





<p>â€¢ Founding â€œVenture Capital for the â€˜Hoodâ€ by going through the necessary process to become an authorized investor and developing a process to vet entrepreneurs in order to identify the best investment opportunities. In contrast to traditional lenders, LASSEI will not lend, it will invest. In exchange for capital, the initiativeâ€™s managers will negotiate terms with vendors for a minority â€œequity stakeâ€ in their business. A program staff will be assigned as an advisor or â€œboard member,â€ and help the business grow over time. At an agreed upon point, vendors will have an opportunity to â€œbuy outâ€ the fundâ€™s shares and resume 100% ownership of their business.</p>





<p>â€¢ Securing at least two other investors for the fund to support lowincome entrepreneurs.</p>





<p>â€¢ Maintaining high standards for LASSEI activities and personnel. Measured by records of weekly checkins between staff and managers, quarterly assessments of Project progress, and a comprehensive yearend report detailing successes, areas for improvement, and next steps.</p>","Street vendors are already an iconic part of Los Angelesâ€™ national reputation for culinary excellence and innovation, as well a daily part of city residentsâ€™ lives. In lowincome communities, almost everyone has a neighbor, a friend, or a family member who at least supplements their family income with street vending.


 


Although street vending as an occupation has existed for hundreds of years, it is often part of the underground economy, which means that it is a highly insecure line of work. Currently vendors are under constant threat from both the city and petty crime, which vendors cannot stop out of fear of police persecution. In addition, because vending is illegal, the city makes no tax or licensing revenue from it and pays fees for policing and storing confiscated equipment.


 


Through partnerships with small business, vendors gain a powerful ally in exchange for helping to revive and adorn empty LA sidewalks in front of those businesses. The creation of a forum that brings formal and informal businesses together will strengthen both sectors through ideasharing and collaboration. Vendors will increase the capacity of their businesses and be more effectively able to fill market niches by understanding the existing business landscape.


 


In 2050, legalized vending will have moderate costs in the shortterm from creating and enforcing new licensing, but will lead to tremendous longterm economic growth benefits. Entrepreneurs on the street operating will no longer fear legal repercussions and for the first time will be able to sustain and grow their businesses, invest more in equipment, and build meaningful relationships with small businesses. And, for those who wish, a legal system for street vendors will create an entrepreneurial pathway for them to grow into their own brickandmortar businesses in the Cityâ€”businesses with a high likelihood of reinvesting locally. Additionally, the whole City will benefit from new income from licensing and tariffs.





Developing of a venture capital fund to support street vendors will allow the City to invest in its lowincome entrepreneurs. The fund will provide capital for vendors to buy new products, certified equipment, hire staff, or even pay for permits. Financial support will not be provided as a loan, but as an investment, in exchange for a minority stake in the business and a commitment from the vendor to work with a â€œboard memberâ€ or â€œadvisorâ€ to support the growth of the business over time. At an agreed upon point, the vendor will have the opportunity to â€œbuy outâ€ the minority stake sold; money that will be reinvested into the fund to support other entrepreneurs. 


 


Ultimately, support for vending has the potential to organically bring investment streams into the poorest areas and communities of LA. It will allow enterprising individuals to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps, creating their own jobs to provide for their families.","<p>Success will be a city in which every entrepreneur has an opportunity to grow and excel at their craft.</p>





<p>Imagine an LA filled with entrepreneurs, looking north to Silicon Valley and south to Mexico for inspiration. Imagine tamale makers with Ipads, their fingers on the communityâ€™s pulse, tweeting freely about their gourmet, safe, organic food. Imagine fruit vendors like personal trainers, tracking their clientsâ€™ nutrition and making sure they get their â€˜5aday.â€™ Imagine coming for the food and staying for the shopping. Imagine safe, walkable streets with a pair of eyes at every major intersection that have the communityâ€™s best interests at heart, and the force of the LAPD behind them instead of against them.</p>





<p>In our 2050, street and sidewalk entrepreneurs meet with business owners to grow their clientele, and share trade secrets on how they can serve entire communities with fresh, homemade, healthy food. They will have access to business coaching and training, working capital for necessary purchases such as equipment, marketing and outreach assistance.  Pockets of incubation along commercial corridors will build a supply network for consumers as mobile as the city of LA, and vacant lots in the projects will fill up with triedandtested businesses started in the streets.  In our 2050, street and sidewalk vendors will be seen not as â€œhawkersâ€ or â€œpeddlersâ€ but as specialty entrepreneurs utilizing patterns of urban movement throughout the day aimed at meeting the affordability needs of Angelenos.  </p>"
3102074,2013074,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MASTERY.html,MASTERY LA: Map Learning & Expertise for Lifelong Exploration, Education,"MASTERY Campaign





Los Angeles is ready to connect the vast talent it has waiting at home  masters in many fields who have time on their hands and interest in making LA a better place to live  with the students who are looking for inspiration and creative action outside of the classroom.





Education received the lowest rating in the LA2050 assessment because our schools are failing most of the kids in our system. We do not provide personalized learning options designed to meet the students at their level and interests, nor do we tailor most content for the rich media world that we are creating here in our tech industry.





In LAUSD today it is difficult for a student to watch a video or play a game, two essential activities that improve learning interactivity and engagement. We will start by working with the community to provide mobile, alternative access to learning resources outside of the classroom for the thousands currently disengaged from the formal learning system. We will be targeting foster youth, dropouts and those disenfranchised by traditional learning and we will partner with great organizations throughout the city that work handson with youth (DIY Girls, Machine Project, Big Art Labs, LA Makerspace are a few identified through the LA2050 events).





We aim to create a path for personalized, lifelong learning for all people, connecting the lost and displaced with educational resources across all types of media, people, places and courses of study.





MISSION: Be the bridge for lifelong education of foster youth and all people, connecting people ready to learn skills with the masters in our community. Map expertise and comprehend our hidden talent!





We can create the virtual support group for these youth to help each other finish their education and move forward to pursue their potential.





SOLUTION:


Targeting youth age 1621 for engagement with masters across fields


Help with sharing their skills as they develop + connecting to mentors


Chart a path to becoming the expert in a new skill and apply for the grants available to achieve goals





We will be asking the masters of Los Angeles to share a quick learning path = how they got to be the master in their field and how they choose to share that path with the next generation of creative leaders. We are creating a dynamic interface and network mapping tool for this learning so that we can see how LA connects the dots, shares resources, where the hidden gems are and how to begin empowering LA's youth to work with our masters in a clear and coordinated way.





This is more than a mentorship program. MASTERY will include:


* Livestreaming hangout series to connect youth around the city


* Opportunities to win tablets and learning resource access


* Bridge support for grants, funding opportunities and open doors to continuing education for those who may be losing hope


* A lifeline and network of care for our disenfranchised youth and their friends throughout the city


* Vision for building the future of Los Angeles together by rapidly building skills across fields and sectors, preparing LA for 21st century careers now emerging





INDICATOR OBJECTIVES FOR LA2050:


* Help at least 1000 kids access financial aid support to follow their path


* Map at least 1000 experts across Los Angeles skills, talents, mastery abilities


* Meet local design challenges through collaboration and invention in community





STRATEGY:


Livestreaming broadcast series in Hangouts + YouTube using the EDDEFY tools


Host live, interactive events produced in the Vortex Immersion Dome at LA Center Studios (home to Mad Men and a ton of famous film/television projects) that match experts and students and bridge gaps for grants, support and continuing education


Use social media to engage with youth and invite participation to find local resources that may be missing on our maps





MAP ALL LEARNING:


Makerspaces, museums, masters, courses, schools and universities, training programs, places that inspire us and resources from games to books and apps that teach us quickly how to work together and achieve our personal goals.





In practice, our events will work a bit like an online game show via Google Hangouts and YouTube, providing access for anyone who can get to YouTube via library or community center. Emancipated youth and those who are transitioning to adulthood will be invited to participate online and these events will build the audience for the live event to be hosted near the end of 2013.





Masters will be mapped over the summer and fall of 2013 in partnership with many major events, festivals and community gatherings where people can take a few minutes to share their expertise and put themselves on the map to begin earning a reputation for their mastery.


","Ten years ago I was a schoolteacher for special education, focused on violent offenders age 1221. 





In one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this atrisk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.





I saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost  and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.





Our team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals.  





Many of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.





So far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events in LA this year.





Previously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of all ages:


* Creating arts events and collaborations including


* Festivals, big events and social connectedness games


* Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula


* Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes





My team has collectively over 2 decades of experience in formal and informal learning settings along with 3 decades of nonprofit management experience and a vast pool of technology tools and expertise to bring to this process. My cofounders include two PhDs in data sciences for analysis and mapping of the insights we find through this campaign and we won awards in our graduate program for our ability to navigate the subtle challenges of the educational field using the EDDEFY toolkit.





I have served in government, lobbied for computers in all schools when I was 7 years old and continue my lifelong work empowering others to be their best through any media available.





Our network collectively reaches over 100,000 experts in Los Angeles.


","Partners include:


C3 (Promotion, arts sponsorship)


Vortex Immersion (Host for immersive education events and livestreaming)

The current situation is grim, but the results will be measurable and we have two PhD researchers on our team who will lead a comprehensive qualitative study of usability and learning progress that includes community support for this atrisk population.





Children who emancipate from the child welfare system are unlikely to find safe, affordable housing.





Within 24 years of emancipation, 25% of emancipated youth have been homeless for at least one night. In California, 65% of youth leaving care do so without a place to live.





Nearly 40% of transitioning youth will be homeless within eighteen months of discharge. In Los Angeles and Alameda counties, 50% of emancipated youth will be homeless within six months.





Without housing, youth are less likely to complete their education, find employment, and gain access to health care, all of which jeopardize their ability to make a successful transition to independence.





Studies found that between 44  77 % of emancipating youth have completed high school as compared to 93% of nonfoster care youth.


Research shows that only 1% to 5% of foster youth ever graduate from college (we can improve this by a long shot!).





Most foster youth want to go to college, but the facts of life in foster care â€“ often including fractured family relationships, living in group homes, and moving and changing schools frequently â€“ work to prevent many students from fulfilling their educational potential (McMillin, et al, 2003). Foster youth are less likely than the general population to complete high school, and those who do graduate are less likely to go to college (Wolanin, 2005). Among those who do go


to college, foster youth are less likely than other students to earn a credential (Davis, 2006).





In 200809, 3,136 foster youth in California received Chafee Grants totaling $12 million, but those youth represent only 47 percent of the eligible applicants that year. Many of the eligible applicants were offered grants late in the academic year, at which point they did not meet the enrollment criteria to receive a grant. Over one thousand of them (18 percent) were never offered one due to insufficient program funding.





From a foster youth in CA: â€œEven twice a year is a lot to move to a whole different school because different schools have different curriculum... What really sucks is that if you donâ€™t have that good support group in high school and if you were moving around all these other times, how are you supposed to get the knowledge to even write well, to read well, to do those kinds of things? ... People have to realize that by moving people constantly, by putting them into volatile situations all the time, youâ€™re reducing the time for the foster youth to actually learn anything in school.â€","1. Map over 1000 masters of Los Angeles to show pockets of expertise and human resources ready to be connected. 


2. Help youth discover opportunities to continue their education inside and outside traditional learning environments in fun, interactive ways.


3. Provide a bridge to funding, grants, technology, training and support for transitional youth who may be falling through the cracks through open events with experts on hand to help.


4. Match the masters of LA and the students who are ready to learn new skills for new apprenticeships and guilds.


5. Offer events that contribute to cultural/arts/connectedness within our communities through alignments with partners throughout the Los Angeles creative communities and other LA2050 grantees.


6. Provide momentum for independent learning with tools to track progress and demonstrate skillbuilding for employment.


7. Connect thousands of learning resources already engaging in improving LA and help people find the best community resources for their personal growth.


8. Understand how we learn better over time and help each individual find an individual learning path that suits their preferences and abilities.


9. Improve dropout rates by providing alternatives that are engaging, local and appropriate for the individual learning profile.


10. Encourage mastery learning and 21st century skills by showing the high quality talent already working within Los Angeles and how we can all work together to make a more amazing and creative city together.


11. Work together to envision the city we want to live in at hackathon events and city festivals.


12.  Empower students to finish their GED by making it into an interactive game played in Google Hangouts to bring together transitional youth with opportunities to learn and complete goals.


13.  Provide easier access to grants and local funding opportunities for foster youth and other young adults who may be prone to homelessness without support.


14. Improve literacy and soft skills by utilizing tablets and mobile devices to creatively engage difficult students in new ways, using music, handson experiences and local masters to bridge the gaps in learning.


15. Create ripple momentum for a @MasteryLA campaign to encourage everyone to become a master in their chosen field and follow their passion through social media and events.


16. Encourage youth to share their learning process publically through events, social media, in learning centers and on the EDDEFY platform.


17. Map the connections between masters and students and how these relationships evolve over time to understand how to improve local education and mentorship services.


18. Identify the areas of the city where services need to be focused for future success between now and 2050.


19. Partner with great local resources to grow great relationships between youth and local masters: BuiltinLA, Mentor organizations and Foster Youth organizations: Kids Alliance, ILP, First Place for Youth","In 2050...

3102075,2013075,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/access.html,EYMs ACCESS / NO EXCUSE, Education,"Educating Young Minds, a nonprofit learning center, is expanding the reach of its educational and counseling programs by undertaking a significant expansion of its preK programs and services. Through an innovative online program, Educating Young Minds is using its 25 years of experience to better serve the underrepresented and atrisk population in Los Angeles. This online service will initially serve 2,500 students, allowing for a later expansion of up to 10,000 students. 





BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EYM


Educating Young Minds is a rich and diverse supplemental learning environment where students are encouraged to grow academically, emotionally and socially. Educating Young Minds grew out of the needs of many students and families for supplemental education and counseling, which overstressed public schools could not meet.





Mrs. Angeles Echols began Educating Young Minds, a nonprofit learning center, 25 years ago in her one bedroom apartment in midcity Los Angeles. She saw the need in our innercity communities for supplemental educational and counseling services. A dysfunctional school district and unsupervised after school environments were, and still are, endangering young people and fueling unacceptable high school dropout rates. Through hard work, good business sense, and a deep understanding of humanity, Mrs. Echols built Educating Young Minds into a thriving community based organization that currently serves 277 students (preK through 12th grade) throughout the year with a staff of 25 teachers, 4 administrative staff, and 3 volunteers in a 12,000 sq. ft. state of the art learning center. Open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. , EYM provides home study instruction, after school tutorial (The Ray Charles / Educating Young Minds Enrichment and Learning Program), standardized test prep classes, a six week summer program, and a college scholarship program that offers EYM high school graduates $6,000 to $12,000 college scholarships. EYM has empowered over 3,500 students with the skills and ability to enroll in, succeed at, and graduate from four year universities.





DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM





â€¢	ACCESS / NO EXCUSE is an online tutorial program developed by Angeles Echols and Educating Young Minds collegiate graduates that provides students with a wide range of learning interactions from preK through college and beyond. The preK component is a comprehensive program that provides:





1.	The EYM Online Curriculum provides sequential lessons in mathematics and literacy. These bilingual learning interactions combine visual and audio learning approaches. Learning interactions move at the rate of the child, custom tailored to his or her needs and ability. Parents go online with the child and are encouraged to take a lead role in interacting in positive, educational, and fun activities. Parents have the option to turn off the sound and follow a prepared script that enables them to become the teacher. The curriculum is geared to encourage positive interaction between the parent and child. The material starts with basic classification and association, phonics, and then progresses to introducing numbers and letters to jumpstart the childâ€™s educational development so that he or she is prepared for elementary school. The site also incorporates an incentive for the students to continue to progress through the curriculum through the use of a point system. A site member earns points for passing quizzes and tests, and they can then use the points to interact within the virtual world.





2.	Virtual World Interactions allow parents and students to choose the subject, be it math, English, or phonics, and within the virtual world, they can interact with other students during the learning process. Students and parents interact with online resources and a freeroaming, 3D, interactive virtual world representation of the Educating Young Minds Learning Center.





3.	EYM Live / Online is a direct video conferencing feed that connects parents and students to teachers, counselors and mentors at EYMâ€™s learning center. Parents will work directly with teachers to provide early education opportunities for their children. Available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. of Fridays, EYM Live / Online will serve families that cannot access area preschools. Parents online provides message boards for parents only, allowing them to interact with teachers, counselors, and each other. Online communities can be excellent resources for support and information; Parents online provides a forum where parents can share their views, and reach out to others in the community.





Using HTML5, this website is accessible on tablets, iPhones, and traditional desktops.





ACCESS / NO EXCUSE is an online educational hub that has been built in large part by EYM alumni. These former students have graduated college and returned to EYM. ","EYM alumni are attending and graduating from colleges from around the nation like Stanford, Cal Tech, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State Bakersfield, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Los Angeles, Cal State Northridge, Clark Atlanta University, Columbia, Cornell, Dillard, Dickenson, Fresno State, Hampton University, Howard, Kentucky State University, Loyola Marymount, Morehouse, Northwestern, San Diego State, San Jose State, Santa Clara, Spelman, Syracuse, Tuskegee University, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, University of Illinois, University of Kentucky, University of Pittsburgh, University of Puget Sound, University of the Pacific, USC, and Xavier. 





To truly express the impact of our programs, we would like to share the story of an EYM alumni in her own words:





LaShia Ransom, EYM Graduate 1999


USC 2003, B.A. DEGREE, SCHOOL 2007, M.A. Counseling Marriage and Family


Child Therapy


Founder NonProfit ""Enriching Communities""





Once upon a time, I was known as a ""selfish little girl with a horrible attitude"", who at 14 knew everything and ""didn't need anyone to tell me â€œAnything"", until that one late evening when my mother found me sitting on my bed crying into my Trigonometry book, with my TI82 in hand. My mom asked, ""What was wrong?"" With tears in my eyes, I looked at my mom for the first time feeling like a failure. I responded, ""I don't know how to do this! I've failed my 2nd math test!"" My mom felt the defeat and sadness in my words. She hugged me and told me, she would figure it out and she would get me some help.





By the end of the week, my mother had found Educating Young Minds (EYM) and Ms. Echols in the yellow pages. I arrived at EYM, embarrassed to admit I needed help. (Please take note I had been an honor roll student since the first grade.) Asking for help was something I didn't know how to do. As my mother and I sat with Ms. Echols she looked at me, then at my mom, asking a lot of questions. I gave one word responses with the most negative attitude you could imagine. That's when Ms. Echols respectfully asked my mother to leave, no, she told her to get out of her office. What happened in that office I rather not mention today, just know that it was done with love and respect and I learned a lot of humility! The rest is history and was truly a blessing!





Needless to say, not only did I pass my Trigonometry class, I became one of the first students to receive a scholarship from EYM in 1999 and graduated from USC with honors in 2003. In 2007, I graduated with a Masters Degree in Counseling Marriage & Family Child Therapy. Today I am a very humble and proud wife and mother, who is employed with the Los Angeles County Probation Department as a Deputy Probation Officer II. Last year I cofounded my own nonprofit organization, ""Enriching Communities"", to be an advocate for inner city youth suffering from substance abuse.","Because of the scalable nature of online service, EYM has discussed ACCESS / NO EXCUSE with a number of potential collaborators. Local schools are interested in the live online tutorial that provides afterschool assistance to students. Community colleges are interested in the vocational possibilities that ACCESS / NO EXCUSE will eventually offer. Corporations are interested in partnering with ACCESS to reach underrepresented communities and individuals. However, first and foremost because of the proprietary nature of the program, the creation of the first phase of ACCESS  the preK educational service, is being done inhouse by our staff of 9 computer programmers. ","Access No Excuse website is designed with the capability to capture and deliver both aggregate and granular levels of data that can support the needs of management, sponsors, parents and other stakeholders. The site will deploy the latest web analytic technologies to accomplish this objective. Using the data, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be built into a website dashboard which will provide Access No Excuse management a critical tool to monitor real time performance of its site operations, evaluate studentsâ€™ progress, as well as produce benchmark data that could be shared with partners or others, as appropriate. 


Website Traffic  Data will include:





The daily number of visits 


The average number of page views per visitor 


Average duration per visit 


The most requested pages 


The total length of each visit 


Frequency of visits 


Navigation pathways from entry points to exit 


Top landing and top exit pages 


Referring sources etc.


To track student progress, the data will be further aggregated to provide metrics such as:





Attendance (visit consistency)


The module each student started and completed 


How many students started each module  


Engagement time (amount of time spent on each module)





Most and least frequently used modules (module popularity) which will provide opportunities for improvement


How many parents logged in with a student and returned to log in for self help


Family level engagement (number of kids in family versus number enrolled in the program)


Demographic breakdown:  age bracket,  gender, culture (i.e. ethnicity), economic level, education,  


Geolocation (area, school district, etc).





With the above range of data elements, both parents and Access No Excuse management will be able to track and measure the progress of the kids at various stages and in different ways. Reports can be produced weekly, monthly quarterly or as needed. Kids of the same age, socioeconomic background, similar parental environment (i.e. single parent, grandparents, multigeneration homes) can be compared.  Specific performance information can be gathered to help determine when a parent or guardian may need further instructional follow up or support. For example, looking at the number of modules a child has signed into, but never completed for a period of time will be a quick red flag. 





Learnings from comparative data can be utilized by management to further enhance the program and potentially provide valuable best practice information to feeder schools or partners within the school district. Aggregate performance data could be used by management and parents to compare kids in the program with similar kids in the school district, county or statewide. Also, based on user profile, specific reports could be created on feeder schools or districts who may be interested in seeing how well their students are doing in the program. ","Lowincome children often begin kindergarten behind their peers. This â€œachievement gapâ€ is well documented, and often widens as children progress through elementary school and beyond. There are many causes for this inequality, but the results are clear: high school dropout rates for African American and Hispanic youth approach 50% in some local schools in Los Angeles.





What is clear, and is consistently supported by data, is that high quality preK programs can have a significant impact in promoting readiness in lowincome children. Just as importantly, programs that focus on parental participation and support can markedly strengthen the education children receive at home, especially for children raised in single parent homes. Some studies have shown that preK programs have the potential to not only significantly narrow the achievement gap, but maintain these academic gains as the child grows.





The challenge remains in providing access to underserved populations. There are many barriers to reaching these underserved populations. Chief among them is access; a lack of nearby learning centers and preschools in lowincome neighborhoods is compounded by difficulties with transportation. Just as importantly, getting families to buy into the process and believing that attending nonmandatory preK programs is of great benefit and importance remains a barrier. ","The online revolution is breaking down barriers that have long separated and segregated society. It is our vision that as connectivity continues to grow, and as the services available online continue to improve, young people will increasingly have equal access to the tools they need to succeed at school and at life. Success in the year 2050 would be an educational system that provides a quality education to all children. Where innercity youth can learn in positive and empowering environments that set high expectations and provide the tools they need to succeed. The internet has the potential to provide this type of access, and it is our vision that we can make a meaningful impact right now and in the future."
3102076,2013076,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/morelearning.html,Learning Equipment Supply Service, Education,"My idea is to create a team of science teacher support  specialists who will visit up to fifteen teachers per week in Los Angeles middle and elementary schools, including the three high school science teachers whom we already serve.  We would support their studentsâ€™ acquisition of gradelevel math and science skills and knowledge by offering three services:  


<p>(1) creation of tutoring programs, </p>


<p>(2) delivery of teacherdriven technical support and professional development, and </p>


<p>(3) facilitation of projectbased and other types of laborintensive innovative learning activities.  


Experience and material resources for these three services already exist on our team.</p>





<p>My indicator is Education. </p> <p> On a completely volunteer basis, running on personal donations from  me, we have been serving a few Los Angeles science teachers with lab equipment loans for about a year.  Feedback from teachers, administrators, and project advisors has indicated that lab equipment is not the biggest problem in Los Angeles innercity science education.  Instead, we need to address deficits in basic skills and scientific background knowledge for younger students before they hit high school.  Formal research studies confirm that the basic academic skill levels of innercity students diverge from the skill levels of their richer counterparts by the sixth grade, as reviewed by this scholarly article from an education research agency: http://educationnorthwest.org/webfm_send/529 .  


Journalism in Los Angeles confirms the need for more science education at elementary schools too, as proclaimed in this Los Angeles Times article: http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/20/opinion/edscience20 .





The three services that I am proposing for funding here would directly address these problems.  These are not new ideas. </p>


<p>1) Basic skills tutoring programs already exist at a few Los Angeles schools, and we have set one up ourselves at a high school; our innercity students either need more of these or need to be connected to these.  </p>


<p> 2) Highquality professional development sessions for science teachers are made available by agencies such as CalTeach at UCLA and JPL at NASA, but none of these programs provide teachers with customized technical help to meet each teacherâ€™s specific needs and goals in their respective classrooms with their own students.  </p>


<p> 3) Many L.A. schoolteachers already implement new ways to get more of their students to learn science, such as projectbased learning and problembased learning, but these inspiring incidences of active learning can be increased and spread to other teachers too, if expert help, teacher support and equipment were to be more readily available. </p> 





<p>These activities will impact education in Los Angeles by improving the skills and interests of students, especially the minority students, flowing into our innercity Los Angeles high schools.  There, our high school teachers will encounter more confidence and better skills in their students, along with better college and career prospects.  Innercity high school science and math teachers will be able to teach at higher levels, with greater rigor.  The resultant increases in selfefficacy of both high school students and their teachers will be evident in higher graduation rates and higher rates of interest in scientific careers.  Ultimately, we will see more of our students going to college and more of our students landing stimulating and wellpaid jobs in L.A. associated with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. </p>





<p>The Learning Equipment Supply Service is currently staffed by volunteers, including me,  in our spare time.  The skills that we practice in our sustaining day jobs directly relate to the services that I am proposing here; for example,  Iâ€™m an experienced lab technician at a fancy private school where I serve and support eight science teachers with their technical needs, and I have also been a middle school science teacher, a high school chemistry teacher, and an adjunct college chemistry instructor.  With the LA 2050 grant, we can bring our alreadypolished skills into the public school arena, to produce a better L.A. for 2050. </p>","<p>In March of 2013, we began lending lab equipment to the science teacher at YouthBuild Charter School in Pacoima. </p>





<p>In March of 2013, we constructed a physics demonstration device and donated it to a physics teacher at University High School in Los Angeles.</p>





<p>In February of 2013, we successfully arranged for a college chemistry major to volunteer as a teaching assistant and tutor in a local Los Angeles high school chemistry classroom (Humanitas Academy of Art and Technology, LAUSD).  The following month, we made this arrangement more permanent by establishing a formal partnership between that high school and EPIC (Educational Participation In Communities) of the California State University Los Angeles, whereby college students may earn academic credit for volunteer work at the high school. </p>





<p>In February of 2013, we brought liquid nitrogen to four Los Angeles middle and high schools for use in demonstrations by teachers.  We also provided the teachers with appropriate safety gear when necessary. </p>





<p>In January and February of 2013, we acquired valuable lab equipment donations from Dr. Vivian Medina of Baxter Bioscience.</p>





<p>In January of 2013, we acquired valuable lab equipment donations from Luz Rivas of Iridescent Learning.</p>





<p>In January of 2013 and in December of 2012, we planned and ran handson science activities sessions at the Zimmer Children's Museum.</p>





<p>In October of 2012, we acquired valuable lab equipment donations from Pasadena City College.</p>





<p>In August of 2012, we became a nonprofit project under the 501(c)3 auspices of the Education Consortium of Central Los Angeles, directed by Jacqueline Hamilton.</p>





<p>In May of 2012, we lent our first piece of lab equipment to a public school physics teacher in Los Angeles (James Rice of Humanitas Academy of Art and Technology)</p>

As many as 50% of the current workforce in those industries locally will become eligible to retire within the next five years.  A larger, more diverse pool of qualified engineers and others will benefit L.A. significantly over the long term.





Further, increased familiarity and comfort with science at the middle 


and high school level will increase the number and quality of local 


applicants to college and technical programs.  A better, more diverse, 


larger applicant pool will benefit technical employers in Los Angeles 


such as Baxter Healthcare, Google, Grifols, SpaceX, others whose hiring needs are expected to increase in coming years.    





In addition to this economic benefit to the area, my project may  


create a better understanding of scientific issues among the general 


public, including voters.  Such a voting public will have a better 


understanding of how to evaluate what is presented in the media about science issues relating to public policy, such as energy generation, pollution, climate change, and many other issues.  





My project empowers future, voting Angelenos by helping them to acquire the background knowledge that they will need to form wellreasoned opinions on local issues of electoral interest.","In  2050, science education in Los Angeles will be a model for the nation in the frequency and quality of handson activities at even the poorest of public schools.  Graduation rates will have seen significant, sustained increase at the many schools served by my 


project.  For a couple of decades up to 2050, state and community 


college science programs in Los Angeles will have been seeing larger 


numbers of highcaliber students entering with focused interests in 


science, and this trend will have encouraged these highered schools to increase the quality of their own science programs.  Students served by my project will raise the bar when it comes to science education.





By 2050, my project will have evolved to provide services to schools to ensure that their own equipment is always inventoried, in good repair, and ready to use.  The project will also have expanded to  serve teachers in other disciplines such as mathematics, in addition to science.  State and school officials across the nation are developing a new set of curricular standards (""Common Core State Standards"") which encourage handson activities in several different subjects.  The adoption of Common Core will have increased the need for support services like LESS, which will have evolved into better support for teachers learning to use projectbased and other innovative handson activities.





In 2050, my idea's project will be continuing under someone else's 


leadership (I'm 38 years old right now), and different funding sources 


will have been identified.  By that time, the project will have been an 


independent nonprofit organization for a few decades.  Some schools or maybe even LAUSD will have chosen to support the project as well.  "

Connect great principals with some really sharp people  <i>Education Pioneers Fellows</i>  to work with them to <b>ASSESS</b> how they currently spend their time, <b>REMOVE BARRIERS</b> to using it effectively and <b>REDESIGN</b> their systems for managing their school so that they can <b>FOCUS</b> on what is critical: supporting the improvement of their teachers and the learning of their students.<br><br>In California, which ranks 49th in the country with regard to per pupil funding, both school districts and charter school organizations must operate with extremely limited resources.  In districts, for example, budget cuts have reduced support staff, and an elementary school principal who may have previously had two coordinators and an assistant principal now functions as the sole school leader. While these cuts are necessary to preserve instructional programming, principals are confronted on a daily basis with urgent operational and management issues that can prevent them from getting into classrooms with their teachers.<br><br>Charter school leaders in California, who also operate with extremely limited resources, are tasked with taking on a range of entrepreneurial challenges that include building systems to support the effective management of their schools. With both district and charter schools, there is a tremendous amount of impact that can be gained by putting practices into place that keep principals out of operational minutiae and instead enable them to spend time with their students and teachers.<br><br>Providing key human capital support to both district and charter school leaders to help them redesign how they are managing their schools and free up their time to focus most on their teachers will have a tremendous impact on students.  To transform the work of hundreds of principals across Los Angeles, this project will seek to:<br><br>1. Understand and improve how principals in multiple different school settings spend their time;  <br>2. Develop, test and disseminate <b>TOOLS</b> that can be used by any of the more than 1000 school administrators across LA. <br><br>The end result is that principals will increase the effectiveness of their teachers through increased observation, coaching, feedback and collaboration and all students will benefit.","Founded in 2003 in response to the acute shortage of leadership and management talent in the education sector, Education Pioneers attracts, prepares, and advances top leaders, managers, and analysts to accelerate excellence in education. <br><br>Our partners include major urban school districts, charter management organizations, and nonprofit organizations. These partners hire EP Fellows to complete mission critical projects and fill important organizational roles. EP provides exceptionally valuable talent to our Partners. Over 90% of Partners indicate that they would hire their Fellow in the future. <br><br>EP has grown into a thriving national organization and since its 2007 launch in Los Angeles has supplied professional talent to nearly 40 education organizations and built a network of program Alumni numbering over 150. EP has significantly expanded the talent supply in education by connecting our Alumni to highimpact careers in education and supporting them to succeed. More than 70 percent of our employed Alumni work fulltime in education.","Education Pioneers (EP) has longstanding partnerships with dozens of organizations in Los Angeles. This project is explicitly structured to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing across the<b> Los Angeles Unified School District, PUC Schools, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, </b>and additional EP partners who will be selected based on their desire to collaborate on generating replicable approaches.","At the outset of the project, all organizations will agree on a few unifying key performance indicators which will be measured before, during, and after the fall semester of the 20132014 school year.  These indicators will include the amount of time a school leader spends supporting teacher instruction.<br><br>Qualitative measures of school leader and teacher perceptions on the effectiveness of the project will be taken via brief online surveys. <br><br>Finally, existing measures, like test scores, will be analyzed from year to year and compared between pilot and comparison schools.","Across Los Angeles every morning, 750,000 students enter their classrooms.  Each of these classrooms is led by a teacher. And each teacher should have a leader who can come into their classroom, observe their instruction and help them to grow so that those 750,000 students get the education that they need to be successful.  Our LA2050 proposal will enable this to happen at a dramatically greater scale.  This project will identify great ideas, develop them into tools that can be replicated, and test them for efficacy. Once they have been demonstrated to be effective they will be ready to be shared across the hundreds of schools that exist in LA.  For example, a tool that saves a principal <b>an hour a day</b>, spread to schools across Los Angeles would translate to nearly a <b>225,000 hours of coaching and support</b> for teachers in their classrooms during each school year. By 2050 this would lead to over <b>8 million</b> additional hours spent developing effective educators in LA. ","In 2050, principals in Los Angeles will lead vibrant communities of effective educators who are reflective and committed to continuous improvement of their instructional practice. These principals will have highfunctioning systems and people in place to assure that their highest priority is providing instructional leadership to develop teacher leaders, and ensure that every child in their school is in a classroom with an effective teacher every day.

3102078,2013078,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/E4E.html,Teachers Leading from the Classroom, Education,"<p>For far too long, education policy decisions have been made without a critical voice at the tableâ€”the voice of classroom teachers. In order to truly improve a public school system that fails far too many students, we must amplify the voices and ideas of teachers who are dedicated to the success of their students. </p>





<p>Reversing a topdown approach to education reform is a paradigm shiftâ€”one that positions teachers as agents, not subjects, of reform. As with any meaningful, longlasting change, itâ€™s not enough to have five or even five hundred teachers challenging the status quo in education. We needed a large and diverse movement. </p>





<p>This was the genesis of Educators 4 Excellence, also known as E4E. We are a movement of teachers elevating our voices, students and profession. Our movement is built uniting Los Angeles teachers around a common vision for change as E4E members, a vision outlined in our Declaration of Teachersâ€™ Principles and Beliefs. This broad set of teacherwritten beliefs is the starting point for an honest conversation about how teachers can shape the policy and legislative changes that are and arenâ€™t happening in education.</p>





<p>Today, our local movement is over a year old and has already grown to more than 2,000 members spread across 450 schools in Los Angeles. We provide teachers flexible ways to engage in our movement while remaining in their classrooms. Thousands of our members learn online by exploring education news, research, policy and peer policy ideas. Hundreds network with peers and policy leaders at our teacherled forums, roundtables and summits. E4E members have taken action by participating in our leadership, policy programs and advocacy campaigns. In addition to leading local advocacy, our Los Angeles members are tapped into E4Eâ€™s broader national movement of over 9,000 educators who are sharing policy recommendations and best practices for raising student achievement.</p>","<p>In just over a year, our members have influenced local and state education policy. Our early impact has included the following:</p>





<p>E4E Members helped break the stalemate on teacher evaluation by presenting their recommendations to UTLA President Fletcher, LAUSD Superintendent Deasy, School Board Members and media, with select recommendations included in the ratified deal.</p>





<p>Dozens of E4E Members signed onto an amicus brief calling on California courts to protect students from layoff policies that disproportionately violated the constitutional rights of students and our most vulnerable, lowincome schools.</p>





<p>100+ E4E Members sent voices to Sacramento to block a regressive bill on teacher evaluation and call for smarter state leadership on education</p>





<p>500+ E4E members signed E4Eâ€s â€œRaising School Revenue and Achievementâ€ petition calling for increasing school funding and tying revenue to meaningful reform and 20+ engaged voters through door knocking and phone banking.</p>





<p>50+ E4E members expanded their influence beyond the classroom by holding leadership positions in their schools, districts and unions.</p>





<p>120+ E4E members took their voices to Sacramento to block the passage of a regressive bill on teacher evaluation.</p>





<p>40+ E4E media mentions that influenced public opinion through highprofile coverage in Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily, Huffington Post, Education Week, KPCC, KCAL9 News and others.</p>","<p>To build and strengthen our movement of classroom teachers, E4E Los Angeles has quickly forged strong partnerships to deepen our knowledge, relationships and impact. </p>





<p>Deepening our Knowledge: E4E Los Angeles has partnerships with research and academic institutions to share best practices, studies and inform our teacherled Policy Teams. </p>





<p>Deepening Relationships: E4E Los Angeles partners with local and state advocacy groups, civil rights groups, communitybased organizations, universities and school networks.</p>





<p>Deepening Impact: E4E Los Angeles partners with state advocacy groups, city and state government elected officials, and litigators who deepen our impact on education legislation and litigation.</p>","<p>Our longterm ambitions are inextricably linked: to increase student achievement, we must also raise the quality and prestige of the teaching profession. We have set immediate and longterm goals to drive our current work. We use the following key metrics to measure our progress building and mobilizing a movement of teachers leading change:</p>





<p>Metric 1: Teachers joining our movement


The number of teachers joining our movement to elevate teacher voice, student achievement and the teaching profession</p>





<p>Metric 2: Teachers leading in schools, districts, unions


The number of teachers taking on leadership roles in their schools, districts and unions





<p>Metric 3: Teachers generating policy recommendations


The number of policy white papers written and presented by teachers to decision makers and influencers. </p>





<p>Metric 4: Teachers advocating for policy changes


The traction of campaigns advocating for E4E teachercreated policy recommendations on policy outcomes, awareness of decision makers, and media coverage.</p>","Three factors make our work particularly impactful in Los Angeles. First, we are providing a safe space for teachers to learn about education policy and talk about the challenges and best practices in their schools. By engaging individual and groups of teachers during and after school, we have been able to hear from thousands of classroom teachers in hundreds of schools in Los Angeles.





Second, we recognize the power of teachers, but also understand the power of building a broad network of teachers, parents, community leaders and policy makers. We break down the barriers that all too often separate parents from teachers or policy makers from classroom practitioners. Through our forums, teachers network with policy makers. We are also part of three local and state coalitions that bring parent groups, faith groups, civil rights groups and community organizations to ensure elected, district and union leaders hear the ideas of solutionsoriented teachers.





Most importantly, we believe in the power of teachers taking collective action on behalf of our students. As elected and district leaders call for specific policy reforms, our members have been able to ensure that those leaders hear the voices and policy ideas of teachers who understand the needs of our students, the concerns of their peers and the implications of policy on school communities. Our members have presented researchbased policy ideas to school board members, union leaders, state legislators, media and civic leaders. They have sent their voices to the California Supreme Court, Sacramento legislature as well as their district and media.


","<p>In the year 2050, great teaching will be demystified. Schools will use data, technology and evaluation tools to identify and learn from the best practices for closing the achievement gap in America.</p>





<p>In the year 2050, teaching will be leading. Teachers will have career pathways that enable them to reach more students and support more peers. As a result, struggling teachers will receive intensive support to improve, average teachers will become great practitioners and great teachers will become influential leaders.</p>





<p>In the year 2050, teaching will be prestigious. We will recognize, leverage, compensate and retain our most effective teachers. A new generation of outstanding graduates will clog principal inboxes with applications to teach. Children will dream about being engineers, doctors, artists or teachers in Los Angeles.</p>"

Are teachers curious and coming to our working sessions and the Original Play Playshop? Is the result original, engaging and replicable?  Is it designed to be a working model open to the initiative and autonomy of teachers in the classroom? Ultimately success will be measured by the outcomes of the proposal writing process: (1) Does it mirror our highest intentions of designing a Mindful pedagogical approach to curriculum, instruction, assessment, teacher education AND also meet the expectations of the Common Core?  (2) Does the teacher education program teach teachers to teach in creative and playful and active ways - does it inspire them to inspire the students? (3) Does the project attract partnerships and collaborators who will speak for it at the LAUSD hearing (if we submit as a charter) (4) Does LAUSD accept the proposal and will El Rio move forward in the 2014-2015 school years as an LAUSD publicly chartered school or an LAUSD pilot school? 





","Los Angeles benefits when our public education system serves the needs of the child and adolescent in the 21st century: People who can initiate and create the new world of work, playful emotionally resilient socially aware people, and people who can think deeply and with imagination. These 21st century needs will be met when our educational system changes to one that is based on a biologically, psychologically, and ontologically correct concept of the human mind in childhood and adolescence. We call this ""mind-fit"" education.  Mind-fit education is mindful education because it enters the reality of the child. When the curriculum, teaching methods, and methods of assessment work in synchronicity with the student's developmental age and individual strengths and capacities learning is irresistible. Educational success, and life success, begins at the K-8 level. The Mindful Education for LAUSD project will be a test-bed demonstrating its value for every student and especially for traditionally hard-to-reach students. Part of the project will be to track the data-points of success - attendance, engagement, behaviour, and initiative as well as on traditional metrics.  ","(1) People in LA will evaluate education in light mindfulness and the age-fitness of the program for children and adolescents as well as the test scores and social equity.  A ""good"" school will be a challenging, mindful, age-fit place where children love to go and enjoy learning and are successful learners. (2) Teachers in LA will have a new hope for their profession as creative, engaging, and powerful. (3) LAUSD schools ADA funding model provides at least $15,000 per year per student as opposed to the current $5,000.  As less funding has to go to fixing problems downstream, more funds will go to educating teachers in mindfulness and age-fit instructional capabilities. This will free up funds to go to autonomy in the classroom and less to minding from the top.  "

We organize around issues important to the community, cultivating, collaborating, and celebrating social and environmental responsibility, volunteerism and our culture. 





Our idea for LA2050 would be an event we will refer to as PLAY.





PLAY -would be a community sustainability, futurist, art, music, and cultural event will be held at LA Center Studios in downtown LA in the Fall of 2013.  LA Center studios is an old oil company headquarters that was transformed into an eco-conscious movie studios.  





PLAY -is a free event to the Angeleno community and a chance to unite the diversity of our city through electronic dance music, art (digital visual, live art, and installations).  Electronic dance music (edm) festivals already have one of the most diverse crowds for any musical genre.  All musical artists and attendees of electronic music events are extremely creative and typically forward thinking. Electronic Music festivals are currently some of the biggest festivals in the world and the popularity of our music style is increasing exponentially amongst the youth here in the U.S. 





PLAY would be a showcase of Los Angeles's most talented and artistic individuals and thinkers.  The idea would be to create art and discussion about the future in an interactive manner to inspire and spark further discussion and action through interactive ""play"".





What we hope to create at PLAY is a chance to bridge the ages of our audience by creating an event that is inclusive of all age ranges within our musical genre which is comprised of numerous sub-genres.  We want this to be an event that both parents and their kids would like to attend.  We would hope to create something that could turn into a World's Fair or SXSW.  LA deserves that.





The first year would concentrate on people being at the studios and having the event concentrated in the Vortex Dome (where we do 3D visual mapping), the beaudry building, and the streets below.  Overtime we see this event spilling into other areas of the the studio as well as downtown.





PLAY will be an event for the future.  A chance to talk openly about current events and future projections through panels but in a fun format.  The most important thing we believe is we just need to make the education about the future accessible, not intimidating, and fun.  We believe this can really only be achieved by integrating music and art into the event. 


","We are still a young organization.  We worked hard last year to get over 100 founding industry and cultural veterans to come on board as our founding members. 





We have also made many key collaborative partners such as E-stewards for our Ewaste program and The Center for Conscious Creativity in downtown LA.





We know we have changed the lives of individuals through personal testimonials and we truly believe we are doing good work.  We have inspired both people and organizations to consider the environment and our other responsibilities back to society.

3102081,2013081,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/enrichla.html,EnrichLA A Garden in EVERY School!, Environmental Quality,"Our idea is simple:  A Garden in EVERY School.





Over the last 2 years EnrichLA has installed gardens of all types in schools throughout Los Angeles County, from the West Side of Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Valley.  We will continue our work, building more gardens in schools throughout Los Angeles, focusing on lowincome and underserved neighborhoods.





School gardens benefit students and communities in a variety of ways.  The most immediate impact for these children is that after our school garden build, students have instant access to green outdoor spaces.  Areas that were formerly unused parking lots or asphalt slabs are now transformed into lush and inviting gardens.  





In addition to improved aesthetics, these outdoor spaces can, over time, impact the health and wellness of children and their surrounding community.  Air quality will be improved, leading to a lower cancer risk from air toxicity, and an increased exposure to the natural world will lead to a higher level of environmental stewardship.  With this new exposure and education, students will learn how to implement changes in their daily life that reduce waste, energy consumption, and pollution.  The gardens also act as catalysts to show students just how versatile, delicious, and fun healthy food can be, developing positive attitudes toward healthy food and increasing consumption of those foods.  The startling obesity statistics in Metro Los Angeles alone demonstrate a strong need for this kind of program.


","In less than two years as a designated nonprofit organization, EnrichLA has built over 35 school gardens.  These gardens range from 1 acre farms, to wildlands schoolyard habitats, to reading gardens, or small edible raised beds.  Our school gardens are inexpensive.  They are built on a shoestring budget using the power of community volunteers to fuel these massive transformations.





In addition to building school gardens, we have also provided â€œHome and Garden Economicsâ€ programs at many of these schools.  With this program, our garden stewards plant seedlings with students and provide regular maintenance to the garden.  Once these fresh fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested, students prepare healthy snacks in their outdoor kitchen.  Throughout this process students are learning about science, lifecycles, composting, the importance of recycling, and they are developing a handson relationship to the source of their food.  





We have seen middle school students enthusiastically exclaim that beets are their new favorite vegetable.  In surveys, students demonstrated that after the garden program they not only ate more fruits and vegetables, but also had more fruits and vegetables available to them in the home, suggesting that the impact goes further than just the classroom.  At one school, the edible school garden program was the catalyst for a new â€œenvironmental magnetâ€ program and has been credited as one key component in the improvement of overall test scores on the campus.  


","EnrichLA has partnered with organizations such as Whole Foods Markets, Gay for Good, Fox Gives, Kaiser Permanente, The Office of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Tree People and others to build school gardens and provide school garden programming throughout Los Angeles.  





We will continue to nurture these partnerships and seek out additional collaborators who share our goal of enriching the lives of children and contributing to a healthier, happier Los Angeles.


","There are both short and long term evaluations that will take place in order to determine the success and necessary revisions to our project.





In the short term, we will survey students and staff before and after their involvement in the garden.  We will track changes in access to fresh, healthy foods, the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed per day, attitudes toward environmental responsibility, as well as time spent in the garden or in outdoor classroom settings.





We will also collect and analyze data from sources such as the LA County Department of Public Health to determine the long term positive effects of school garden education, by evaluating changes in obesity and diabetes rates, and improvement in air quality and access to parks.





Success would mean more children having access to green outdoor spaces, and more teachers utilizing these spaces for classes.  Success would be an improvement in health due to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and a healthier attitude toward overall wellness.  ","Our project will benefit Los Angeles by bringing edible gardens into schools.  These gardens cheer up communities, improve campus morale, and act as outdoor classrooms.  For many students, these school gardens are their only access to green, outdoor spaces in their neighborhood.  By improving the environmental quality of their surroundings, children are more likely to succeed.  We have seen firsthand how access to edible gardens can improve test scores and community involvement.





Additionally, these gardens address the serious problem of obesity and obesity related diseases among our residents.





According to the CDC, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 will contract diabetes in their lifetime. If that child is either Hispanic or Black, the odds of this happening is increased to 1 in 2. In response to the staggering childhood obesity statistics, the Center for Disease Control states that:





""Schools play a particularly critical role by establishing a safe and supportive environment with policies and practices that support healthy behaviors.  Schools also provide opportunities for students to learn about and practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors""





Our school gardens directly address this issue, not by forcing children to eat healthy food, but by encouraging them through access and education.


","For EnrichLA, success would be defined as a healthier, happier Los Angeles.  Children in the most urban, asphalt covered areas of Los Angeles would have access to green, outdoor spaces.  They would grow up learning about healthy, natural foods, and they would have access to these foods not only in the home, but in the classroom as well.  They would be inspired to learn about the natural world not forced.  This education would lead to improved health, test scores, and a sense of community and environmental responsibility. 





Currently, 1.6 million children in Los Angeles County do not have access to parks.  Our school gardens change that, and in 2050 our goal would be for all children, particularly those in lowincome, at risk and underserved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, to have access to green outdoor spaces.  These spaces enrich the minds and bodies of children, their families, and the community as a whole.

3102082,2013082,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ChangeMakingGardens.html,ChangeMaking Gardens, Environmental Quality,"What if that broad expanse of grass in your local community was instead producing healthy, nutritious, organic fruits and vegetables?  Our project is about empowering citizens to turn the underutilized spaces around them into productive gardens: public spaces where people can learn, gather, and share.





Food gardens can be beautiful nature spaces within our concretebound city.  Community gardens can provide gathering places in a city that doesn't have much public open space.  Public gardens can be places to meet your neighbors and work together; they are centers for learning, for arts and culture, and for a new sense of community.


Gardening is enticing, fun, approachable, and accessible to multiple demographics.  It builds health through exercise and stretching, sunshine and fresh air, and promotes healthy eating with fresh, organic, local, clean, unprocessed food.  In these times of ongoing economic contraction and resource limitations, learning the skills of growing food is a necessary skill for survival.





Community gardening provides an excellent vehicle for much broader lessons about environmental stewardship and social dynamics.  Organic gardening opens the door to muchneeded conversations about pollutants, toxins, consumerism, and activism.  It cultivates new perspectives on humanity's place within the earth's ecosystems.





Our project is about **changing minds**, which then inspires people to change their habits, surroundings, and environment. 





Our proposal consists of three parts:  


1) Growing gardeners.  Through experience, we understand that â€œmore community gardensâ€ is not simply a matter of more physical construction and installation.  Rather, we must grow the skillbase to maintain the spaces we create.  We propose to offer a series of ""Organic Vegetable Gardening"" classes for the general public at multiple locations around the greater LA area.  Our unique approach to gardening education integrates organics, permaculture, saner resource consumption, and ecosystems awareness.  We integrate food gardening with environmental transformation. 


 


2) Growing gardens.  The grant would make it possible for ECM to mentor several community groups* who are contemplating the installation of community gardens like ours.  We can guide these prospective community garden groups, based upon our experiences of what works/doesnâ€™t work; help them find resources; match landholders with knowledgeable local food gardeners; give them a helping start with garden design to create beautiful, artful, and healthful open spaces; help them learn how to make the most out of minimal inputs, available onsite materials, and shoestring construction budgets; help them establish and grow a local leadership team. 


*(specific sites are currently being identified by our networking partners)





3) Growing rootlevel change.  To deepen environmental transformation, we would host a training about a much more panoramic view of change.  The Transition training (a) raises awareness of the sweeping implications of peak oil, climate change, resource limitations, and the economic crisis, (b) helps participants grasp the vast number of things that can be done at the grassroots level to prepare for such a future, and (c) trains participants to be community leaders for this preparedness effort.  It includes training on community empowerment, evolved group dynamics, economic solutions, and the psychological implications of the massive changes humanity faces. We propose to bring trainers from Transition US (the national representative of the international Transition Network) to Los Angeles, to train leaders and help additional local neighborhoods start neighborhood action groups.  Grant funding would make this training accessible to low income participants in lessaffluent areas of our megacity, so that postpetroleum preparedness can get underway on a widespread basis.


","In 2005, we founded the Environmental ChangeMakers (ECM), a network of ""proactivists"" who focus on What We Can Do about our environmental and social issues.


In 2008 ECM built the Community Garden at Holy Nativity.  ECM members continue to manage this garden's production and have achieved 5 years of weekly harvests for the benefit of Food Pantry LAX.


Since 2008, ECM has offered monthly Organic Vegetable Gardening classes to the general public.


In 2008, ECM hosted the first Transition Training in Southern California, bringing trainers in from the UK to do so.  Subsequently, we launched 8 action groups in neighborhoods around the greater LA area.


In 20092011, ECM worked with LAUSD and the Mayorâ€™s office to found and build the Emerson Avenue Community Garden.


","ECM been asked to be the garden knowhow and support for the ""Seeds of Hope"" community garden program (directed by the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles).  ECM has an ongoing / founder relationship with Transition Mar Vista/Venice, Transition Culver City, NELA Transition, and the Emerson Avenue Community Garden (Westchester).  ECM has collaborated in the past in varying capacities with The Learning Garden (Venice), the Seed Library of Los Angeles, the Arroyo SECO Time Banking network, Our Time Bank (Culver City), Whittier Time Bank, Metabolic Studios (downtown), the Green Team at Cal Poly Pomona, Good Karma Gardens (Mar Vista), Permaculture networks throughout Southern California, Transition US and the international Transition Network.","We will evaluate our success at Growing Gardeners by the number of participants in the garden classes and with a followup survey. 


 


In evaluating our success at Growing Gardens, we understand from experience that a meaningful and changemaking garden and garden community cannot be built within the short timeframe defined by a grant.  Within the timeline of this grant, we will evaluate success by the number of prospective community gardens we support and the degree of our involvement.  Longerterm â€“ over a period of years â€“ the better measure of our success would be how many gardens are brought to fruition (built, maintained, and harvested).  Another longer term measure of Growing Gardens success would be the number of communities who eventually become ready to deepen their environmental transformation by sending participants to a Transition training.





Within the timeline of this grant, we will evaluate our success at Growing RootLevel Change by the number of participants in the Transition training and by the diversity of participant demographics.  Longerterm, however, the better measure of success will be how many training graduates go on to establish active groups in their home neighborhoods, and the degree to which those groups engage local neighbors in proactive change.


","Right now to get a plot at a community garden, in most places in LA County you have to wait 3 to 6 YEARS.





Meanwhile, there are many groups that are â€œthinking aboutâ€ creating a community garden.  ECMâ€™s networking partners know specific landholders who are â€œthinking aboutâ€ opening their land to growing food.  Yet all these groups are scared of the unknown because they have never done it before.  





We have.  Weâ€™ve created gardens in several vastly different models of what â€œcommunity gardeningâ€ can mean (traditional plot style, school garden, and charity style).  We can share what works and what doesnâ€™t work, and help groups who are â€œthinking about itâ€ get past the mullingitover stage into meaningful action â€“ into creating real, physical, muchneeded garden spaces.  Ultimately, our project will facilitate much more land being available for community gardens in Los Angeles.





Additionally, ECM has the connections â€“ locally, nationally and internationally â€“ with people who are taking a proactive stance to the threats posed by climate change, peak oil, resource limitations, and economic contraction.  These are big scary problems, but there is plenty that we can do as grassroots citizens.  Our project will lead to greater awareness of the issues, with more people striving to prepare our city and its citizens for the realities of the future.


","By the year 2050, direct success would look like far more food gardens in and around Los Angeles.  Local residents will know how to garden their food and harvest rainwater.  Theyâ€™ll exchange the delicious and healthful fruits of their harvests with each other.  Local neighbors will feel a sense of â€œbelongingâ€ to their home communities, and happy gatherings of all colors and cultures will frequent the beautiful open spaces under the L.A. sunshine.





By 2050, everyone will be really glad that way back in 2013, people started planning for the realities of the future.  Because of that planning, people of the late 2010s began to â€œTransitionâ€ their lifestyles.  They began to think locally, and build up local infrastructure, so that the pain of having less and less petroleum and energy supply (and thus less transportation and less technology) hasnâ€™t been nearly so great. 





Because people understood that climate change was coming, they planned appropriately.  They planted lowchill fruit trees that could adapt, which in 2050 still bear fruit despite hotter temperatures.  They knew to save seed locally and develop food plant varieties which are adapted to LAâ€™s changed weather patterns. They talked among themselves (in those delightful community gardens) and began to build water cisterns and energyfree devices to cope with the heat. 


 


Now (in 2050), elders hand down to younger generations the skills of growing rich, nutritious, local food, and it is normalized within the culture that everything is fresh and organic.  The community gardens that were built back in the mid2010s are now a vital part of The Commons.  They are the â€œtown squaresâ€ where people gather socially, gather to make art and music, gather to discuss community issues, and gather to enjoy their food together.

3102083,2013083,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Park-in-a-Box.html,PARKINABOX, Environmental Quality,"ParkinaBox (PIB) is a moveable popup park.   Two shipping containers outfitted to carry park amenities will travel to neighborhood sites for specific community events. Using underutilized open spaces in Los Angeles, community outreach organizations will schedule an event, order PIB, unpack and configure the containers, and help to activate a neighborhood public space.  We anticipate up to four scheduled events during this initial pilot program phase scheduled by our partner community organizations. 


ParkinaBox is a kit of park essentials â€“ chairs, tables, umbrellas, kidsâ€™ playgrounds, bbq grills, etc. â€“ as well as specialty items requested for particular initiatives inflatable installations, projectors, sound system, staging areas, and lights.  Once the contents are unpacked, the containers themselves unfold and transform into visual anchors of the park.  Voila! The park is ready!  


Please visit www.parkinabox.la for more information about how ParkinaBox works (more images after the jump).


","ERW Design + SALT have partnered to develop the ParkinaBox concept.  ERW Design (www.erwdesign.com) is an awardwinning, multidisciplinary architecture firm whose work is based on the intersection of the built form and the landscape. Founded in 1999, ERW Design has completed over 40 institutional, residential, and landscape projects throughout the Los Angeles area. 


ERW Design is experienced working with a wide array of neighborhoods and communities throughout Los Angeles.  Some notable projects include the Marsh Park Pavilion at Marsh Park, the first regional park on the LA River in Elysian Village; the Vista Hermosa Park structures in downtown Los Angeles; Beverly Gardens Park Restoration in Beverly Hills; and an allages exhibition gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.


ERW Design received the Grand Prize, as well as the award for best Civic Project for their work at Vista Hermosa Park.  The project received Best Urban Project by the Los Angeles AIA in 2009.  


SALT Landscape Architects (www.salt.com) is a Los Angelesbased design studio focused on creating enduring, engaging, and innovative landscapes on a range of scales. The firmâ€™s name, derived from â€œsalt of the earth,â€ reflects the sense of grounding that we strive for in all of our projects. 


SALT has been working with the Trust for Public Land (www.tpl.org), also our partner for ParkinaBox, over the past year to bring significant changes to the Avalon community of Los Angeles, south of downtown. SALT developed a master plan for the pedestrian opportunities in the community, including a thorough analysis of the existing pedestrian challenges and degraded mobility infrastructure.  We also developed designs for the conversion of more than 1,800 linear feet of alleyways into storm water infiltration centers and enhanced pedestrian and bicycle pathways. This project has already received over $1.7 million in funding to date in public funding from various local, county and state agencies and expects to have the construction documents completed by the end of 2013.


SALT also cofounded the Take Back the Boulevard (TBTB) initiative in 2011 in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. TBTB is seeking to bring significant pedestrian improvements to Colorado Boulevard through a grassroots and community based effort, focused on recapturing a portion of the public rightofway from automobile traffic and reallocating it for other modes of transportation. Through a series of outreach efforts facilitated by the TBTB steering committee, the initiative has brought the community together to identify ways of making Colorado Boulevard more humanelyscaled and more of a â€œMain Streetâ€ with a vibrant business district and pedestrian life. 


Both SALT and ERW Design continue to seek unique opportunities to work closely with local constituencies to develop innovative approaches to remaking Los Angeles incrementally more humane and sustainable.","PIB has already received a statement of support from the Trust for Public Landâ€™s Parks for People Program in Los Angeles (http://www.tpl.org/whatwedo/wherewework/california/losangelescounty/parkacquisitiondesign.html), which works with local residents to transform vacant lots and underutilized spaces to vibrant active parks all over Los Angeles.  The Trust for Public Land recognizes PIB as a valuable tool for quickly activating vacant or underused lots while waiting for the sometimes lengthy park development process to unfold.   As the design team, ERW + SALT will work closely with the Trust for Public Land and other community organizations with similar missions, who will play a key role in the successful implementation of PIB.","For this pilot program, we will closely evaluate and assess the project using primarily qualitative methods, namely incorporating observations and feedback into a design feedback loop.  We will be present at the pilot events and observe the onsite activities and usage.  In addition, we will interview user groups and outreach groups to gain a better understanding of how ParkinaBox is performing with regard to our expectations and user expectations. 


Given the feedback we receive in the pilot stage, we will work with user groups and our partners to refine the program to ensure continued usage of the basic ParkintheBox infrastructure.


If PIB is successful, communities will ask our partners to extend the initiative in their community, schedule another event, or request additional initiatives utilizing PIB.  A successful PIB pilot program will energize a neighborhood and be an example of a quick and effective solution to the lack of nearby access to usable open space in Los Angeles.  


","Los Angeles has many parkpoor neighborhoods and many communities have limited access to usable open space.  Obesity levels are high, caused in part by lack of access to active spaces and programs.  ParkinaBox, with partner organizations, will provide access to underutilized space in underserved neighborhoods, and provide the ingredients necessary for lively and useable open spaces.  Through this new model, ParkinaBox hopes to draw attention to the need for public spaces within these communities and encourage Angelinos to reevaluate how we think about public space in our city.


Please visit www.parkinabox.la for more information about how ParkinaBox works (more images after the jump).


","ParkintheBox has the potential to kickstart the conversion of empty lots into permanent neighborhood assets.  Success in the year 2050 would see the doubling of permanent small and medium sized public spaces in identified parkpoor neighborhoods, and the City of Los Angeles would be recognized as the national leader in promoting neighborhood open spaces.  PIB is a catalyst for neighborhood change and a strong contributor to building a greener, healthier city for all communities."
3102084,2013084,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TeamTeacherSLP.html,ESP Team Teacher Service Learning Project, Education,"ESP Empowering Services Through Partnerships 501(c)(3) created the Team Teacher Service Learning Project (TTSLP).  The TTSLP encompasses the idea of reducing the studentteacher ratio by 50% (2 teachers per 3040 students).  By providing an additional teacher, Team Teacher Service Learning Project (TTSLP), to service those classes that are in the greatest need, students are again afforded an opportunity of a quality education and can once again use the teacher as a resource and a facilitator of the actual learning process.  





III.	Our Vision


ESP Empowering Services Through Partnerships 501(c)(3) idea will improve Los Angeles and positively impact Education and Social Connectedness, 2 of the 8 indicators.  Our vision encompasses partnering to educate our youth on the core content standards while engaging them in Service Learning Projects. 


IV.	 Service Learning


Service learning is a teaching strategy that combines meaningful service to the community with acquisition of academic learning and skills.  The Team Teacher Service Learning Project is a service learning project that encompasses all of the core curriculum areas of English Language Arts, Science, Technology, Engineering, Fine Arts, Math, and the Social Sciences.  While students are learning the content areas, they are engaged in the process of relating it to a real life experience that can directly impact their community and streaming it towards Sustainability: using the acquired knowledge and skills to sustain their learning and their community.  This learning through service approach not only provides a meaningful approach to learning the content areas but also builds a sense of community, responsibility, awareness, and selfesteem.  Overall, students will serve as active participants who are actively engaged within their learning which will directly improve their academic performance and increase academic achievement.  


By teaching the content through service learning projects, students will be more socially conscious and active toward issues concerning their communities. Consequently, they will become more engaged in the actual learning process while serving their community.  Moreover, this experience will drive them to a more successful and meaningful learning path and thus creating productive communitybased citizens.  Students will be able to use these acquired skills throughout their educational careers as well as throughout life.  In addition, values of service, empathy, and community building will be instilled from an early stage and students will be engaged in the process of community sustainability.





V.	 ESP Team Teacher Service Learning Project


The TTSLP instructor is a highly qualified credentialed educators.  He/she will serve as a coteacher that enhance the primary teacher's content by engaging students in  Service Learning Opportunities.  While providing additional support, the primary teacher will be afforded opportunities to prioritize instruction based on student individual needs.  Subsequently, students will be able to access the core curriculum and serve their community; thus resulting in academic successâ€”as proven by the decrease in dropout rates, and increases in proficiency level within the core content, Academic Performance Index, social skills, and community building. 


 Prior to the lessons, both teachers would collaborate on the goals and objectives of the content core standards.  Teachers would initiate learning talks engaging students on becoming socially conscious learners.  During this process students will be taught the process of the strategic thinking where they conduct needs assessments and goal setting as it relates to students and community members.  Subsequently, teachers begin to  facilitate service learning projects that would incorporate the identified needs and the core content learning standards.   An example would be a Geometry class learning about the area and perimeter formula and taking this information and applying it to  a Service Learning gardening project.  


",We are a grassroots organization.  We are currently in the state of begininning implementation and have been coteaching in the classrooms educating students on the effects of the sequester as it relates to their community.  Having a pre and post assessment students have shown an increased interest in participating in Service Learning Projects.  ,"Administrators, teachers, schools, communities, and other organizations within Los Angeles.","Pre and post surveys, comparative state and district assessment result (pre/post implementation)","This project will:


* increase academic achievement within Los Angeles


* increase the Academic Performance Index of Low Performing Schools within Los Angeles


* decrease the drop out rate in Los Angeles 


* provide a more meaningful educational experience to youth within Los Angeles


* promote empathy within our Los Angeles community


* create students who are socially conscious and active toward issues concerning our Los Angeles Communities.  


These results will directly impact Los Angeles because it will ignite a system where prople are socially engaged within their community and are addressing community needs which will positively impact our community.","Proven academic successsignificant decrease in dropout rates, increase in proficiency level within core content areas, Incerease in Academic Performance Index, Increase in level of social skills, and increase in community building."
3102085,2013085,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/aquaponics.html,25 Aquaponic Farms in 25 Schools, Education,"Food IS the common thread that can help solve the worldâ€™s major problems simultaneously. Urban farming points us in the right direction and aquaponics is the vehicle to get us there. Aquaponics is the most sustainable (economically and environmentally) way to grow food on the planet â€“ most water efficient, highest yields, zero waste, betterthanorganic, with incredible taste. It is a closedloop system that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (growing food in water). We developed a highly efficient model that grows more food per square foot than just about anything, using vertical grow towers. The rendering posted above can produce up to 1000 plants per year in just 20 square feet in optimal conditions. Aquaponics grows leafy greens, herbs and fruiting crops along with edible or ornamental fish. After several years of operating different types of aquaponic systems we have found this approach to be the easiest and most efficient way to learn, teach and jump right into the excitement of growing your own food.  





OUR PLAN: We are prepared to install 25 of our unique aquaponic systems in 25 schools in 2013. Each school will receive training based on our existing course and manual (Art & Science of Aquaponics) coupled with maintenance and support. We will also encourage installation of the vertical growtower system to become a class project. Additionally, we have also budgeted to pay a stipend to 4 teachers to help us convert our course into a curriculum that meets CA State Standards. Integrated Environmental Education (including urban farming) has been proven by our partner Environmental Charter High School to lead to the highest graduation rates (and acceptance to 4year colleges) in the US. Aquaponics is the future of farming on planet Earth. By combining the two, aquaponics + education, what better way to cultivate a resilient community?

","Seeing 25 functioning aquaponic systems installed on 25 campuses is a great milestone for any school district.  Counting the numbers of teachers who have integrated aquaponics into their existing course work will be a bonus.  Listening to the student â€œaquaponics ambassadorsâ€ give educational tours to their peers and community members will be a leap in education.  Looking beyond 2013, the project will have maximized success when the school district begins to open up more land on campuses not just for educationalscaled systems, but also for aquaponic farms to be installed, sized accordingly, to feed the campus and the neighboring communityâ€¦ offering a clear path towards a hyperlocal food system. ","OPEN SPACE IS FARM SPACE:


Enough unused land exists in LA to feed LA. If we considered just the 5000 acres of asphalt that LAUSD owns and converted 4% (200 acres) of that to aquaponic farms, we could put a salad on EVERY Angelinoâ€™s plate EVERY day of the year. The revenue the School District could earn would radically change the face of public education. Imagine teachers paid a fair wage, students learning useful vocational training, schools nourishing the minds and bodies of our youth, and communities benefiting from neighborhood farms and schools â€“ the way LA used to be. Evo Farm offers a profound steppingstone to get us there. 





REDUCTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES: Almost all of the diseases we face are not only preventable but also reversible. They can be turned on and off based on what we eat and what we donâ€™t. In the US, we spend as much on these diseases as we spend on defense ($700 Billion annually). A path towards reducing these costs opens the door to happier, healthier world. Children who are involved in growing vegetables will eat vegetables and are more likely to raise their children to do the same. Evo Farm will teach them to turn our food deserts into food oases. 





WATER EFFICIENCIES:  Some people still question the validity of climate change, but the reduction of available freshwater on the planet is undisputed. Last year was probably the worst year for agriculture on record due to drought (and extreme temperature). Aquaponics offers extreme water efficiencies (95% more efficient than conventional ag) and opens the door to a reliable food source.  Many of these farms can operate largely on existing rainfall (only possible with aquaponics) that LA receives annually coupled with the steady stream of the LA River. Evo Farm is creating fully functioning, scalable micro farms demonstrating the greater potential. 





URBAN FARMING IS JOBS: Training the future farmers of America is essential. Captivating them with exciting greentech (triple bottom line), income potential ensures we have an able and willing labor force to do this essential work. It is not just about plants and animals, it is about marketing, IT, business development, finance, accounting, supply chain management, customer relationship management, local manufacturing, engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Urban farming drives a local and resilient economy. A return to our agrarian roots is the single greatest step we can accomplish to allow for the health of individuals, health of communities and health of the planet. 


","Ironically, success means to us that we have trained enough people and built enough farms that we have essentially worked ourselves out of job. By then, LA will be operating enough farms in the city to provide the fruits and vegetables we eat. The ability to grow food will be a requirement to graduate high school. Cafeterias will harvest and prepare fresh food daily. Diseases like obesity and heart disease will be nearly eradicated.  Fast food chains will have been replaced by salad and juice bars. Restaurants and institutional kitchens will source the majority of their food from town. Selling fruits on corner stands will no longer be stigmatized and illegal, but integrated into the policy of the city.  Food justice and environmental justice issues will be taught in our history classes.  And everyday will be an opportunity to celebrate easy access to the healthiest best tasting foods possible.  All of this is not only possible, but also inevitable.  "
3102086,2013086,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FallenFruit.html,ENDLESS ORCHARD,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Fallen Fruit is an art collaboration that uses fruit as a lens by which to see the world.  All our projects are collaborative, forging unique art experiences that connect people to the places they live.  This January, we were awarded a 2013 Creative Capital grant for â€œEndless Orchardâ€ â€” a public installation of fruit trees in an urban setting that creates an orchardlike grove punctuated by mirrored surfaces, like a prism that creates an illusion of infinity.  Our LA2050 proposal is to extend the orchard of fruit trees into the neighborhoods of Los Angeles County in a way that ultimately transforms the cityscape into a sparkling inhabited orchard.<p>





This public installation contrasts the flashy technology of the spectacular with its opposite, the quietly growing abundant fruit tree.  One is fast and complex, like a kaleidoscope, and the other is slow.  One is all surface, and the other is all substance.  But this is the idea: to see the relationship between our food and its history and how we live today.  It interrogates our use of land, our values, and how we relate to one another.  It asks us to take a close look, to see beyond the illusions the world presents us with.<p>





With the support of LA2050, we can bring this concept to the next level by planting fruit trees in the adjacent neighborhoods to transform both their appearance and the way they function.  Itâ€™s an immersive expansion of the Public Fruit Tree Adoption projects weâ€™ve held in past years.  Hundreds of bareroot fruit trees are given to residents through art spaces or cultural centers.  These are gifts, and the recipients are asked to collaborate in the project: to care for the trees and to plant them on the border between private and public property, creating a resource to share with others.  The abundance of these trees and their fruit creates a legacy for the communities of Los Angeles, with each block or neighborhood devising its own way to care and share for their informal orchard.<p>





These Public Fruit Tree Adoptions transform a colorful idea into a vibrant reality.  They literally root the necessity of healthy food and green space in the fabric of our daily lives. Some of these concepts have been prototyped in the newly dedicated Del Aire Public Fruit Park, in Hawthorne, CA.   Fallen Fruit of Del Aire â€“ Public Fruit Park is also the first public fruit park in the State of California.   Still in its sapling stage, this park has already impacted the neighborhood of Del Aire in the shadow of LAX.  Fallen Fruit planted 27 trees in the park itself, with 65 more distributed in the blocks surrounding it.  This is the smallscale model for our much greater ambitions.  We like to say that the point of art isnâ€™t to describe what you want to see, but to make it.<p>





Fallen Fruitâ€™s series of Public Fruit Maps illustrates what already exists in our streets: surprising pockets of fruit trees that exist more through chance than planning â€” lucky, generous survivors of our urban ecology.  Endless Orchard and our other public fruit parks enshrine these trees and creating a living kind of advocacy for an urban landscape.  But in the end itâ€™s not about art, and not about shrines.  Itâ€™s about changing the nature of the city, putting nature back into the city, and imagining a topography that transforms the way we experience a place â€“ both the familiar and the exploratory.<p>





For Fallen Fruit, a piece of fruit is more than nourishment: itâ€™s a symbol of culture, and a symbol of the basic social bonds not just between grower and consumer, but of the rituals of sharing and community.  One of the places this symbol gets activated is in our ongoing series of Public Fruit Jams, in which groups of friends and strangers gather to make jam together, working collaboratively in a ritual that resembles the communal harvests of another epoch.<p>





Fallen Fruit has worked with fruit, public space and the public for over 9 years.  We have three tightly linked indicators for our project: Arts & Cultural Vitality, Environmental Quality, and Social Connectedness, and we do not want to separate them.  We are artists whose work is a form of activism that examines the ecology and environment that surrounds us and uses the object of fruit to forge new and unexpected social connections.<p>





Endless Orchard is a living public artwork that emanates from a defined focal point to suffuse the neighborhoods of Los Angeles County with change from the ground up, systematic change that transforms our conception of the city.  It will take on a life of its own, possessed by no one and shared by everyone.  By growing into the urban fabric it empowers people to change how they share resources, how they live daily life, and how they experience a city as great as Los Angeles.


","The three artists in Fallen Fruit, David Burns, Matias Viegener and Austin Young, have been developing their collaboration for nine years.  We began simply by examining what was growing in our own neighborhood in Silver Lake, and we found numerous overlooked fruit trees, often a bit neglected, growing in or over public space.  We mapped them, wrote manifestos about them, documented them and then brought people to see them.  <p>





Our neighborhood began to transform: more trees appeared and people started picking the fruit.  We mapped other neighborhoods nationwide, and were invited around the world to create a range of work on things from the vast expanse of berries in the arctic to the contentious history of banana plantations in South America.  <p>





Our most ambitious project to date was EATLACMA, a yearlong residency at LACMA in 2010, which included an exhibition, five artistcommissioned gardens, several events including two Public Fruit Adoptions, and a daylong curated performance and intervention in the museumâ€™s spaces that broke attendance records.  It was funded in part by a $100,000 MetLife Foundation Community Connections Grant, and received over 100 million press impressions.  EATLACMA included our Public Fruit Theater, an intimate amphitheater built with recycled city sidewalks around an orange tree, which delivered a slow and beautiful performance of the seasons: blooming, leafing and fruiting. <p>





In the last three years weâ€™ve had two projects titled Accion Fruta Urbana, one in Tijuana, Mexico, and the other in Madrid, Spain, as part of ARCO 2010.  In the latter, we worked to populate a workingclass quarter of the city with 50 fruit trees.  Temporarily impeded by an uncooperative municipal government, the trees found a home in a communal park, Esta es una plaza.  The project was accompanied by a billboard and bus shelter campaign in over 300 locations, which contributed tremendously to raising public consciousness. <p>





Most recently, we completed the new Del Aire Public Fruit Park in Hawthorne, near the intersection of the 405 and 105 freeways.  Funded by an award from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the park is planted with an â€œeyeâ€ of 27 fruit trees, with 65 trees â€œadoptedâ€ and planted by residents in the neighboring streets.  It received a tremendous reception in the press, and KCET is currently shooting a documentary on the park and our collaboration.<p>





The proposal for Endless Orchard is the recipient of a 2013 Creative Capital award, which will bring in at least $50,000 in funding for the project.  Though this is not its full budget, it offers us a remarkable level of professional support in seeking out further funding and development. ","Weâ€™ve just begun looking for the right site for Endless Orchard. Through our experience with the Del Aire Public Fruit Park, we are on good working terms with the departments of Parks & Recreation, Health & Safety, and the DWP. We have incredible support across broadcast media, museums and public institutions throughout Southern California. We work with groups such as the Los Angeles Urban Rangers and Food Forward, an activist group that practices â€œfruitanthropy,â€ gleaning fruit from neglected trees on private property & distributing it to the needy. We have longterm relationships with Treepeople LA, Projecto Jardin, the Metabolic Studio, Watts House Project, Watts Towers/Grand Central Arts Center, USC, UCLA, LACMA, and the Hammer.","The most essential measure of this project is the level of participation: the number of people who adopt trees and plant them on the boundary of public and private, as well as the far greater public who sees these trees and starts to think about what they might mean.  This is the way people create a new public â€” not one we as artists have created, but one they create with each other.  This public has an evolving consciousness of urban life and how it must change to become more habitable. <p>





The simplest measure of the projectâ€™s success is to keep a count of the neighborhoodâ€™s fruit trees, which is part of the goal of our Public Fruit Maps.  Every neighborhood weâ€™ve made maps in has seen an increase in fruit trees, and we believe in part thatâ€™s because the map focalizes people attention.  It raises consciousness, and presents a vision of what might be that suffuses what is already there.  <p>





Other measures of the success are more mechanical: Googletype metrics, broadcast media impression and public participation.  While watching neighborhoods transform, what cannot be quantified is how people feel.  We believe that fruit trees are a powerful symbol, and the symbol extends outwards from the actual presence of trees into the way they enter public consciousness.  Weâ€™ve had great publicity over the years, and our media base is constantly growing.  ","This project is uniquely tied to Los Angeles by history.  Much of the land on which the city is built was once citrus orchards, most of them razed over the last century for building sites.  Almost the only trace that remains is in old postcards of endless orchards with a backdrop of snowcovered mountains, the vigorous fruit contrasting against the icy peaks.   These cards fed the utopian dream of California, a bountiful place where you could live in beauty and comfort.  <p>





Fallen Fruitâ€™s work has often alluded to this past, a way of holding on to a utopian impulse in the middle of our urban grit.  It comes with echoes of democracy, the idea of a just world in which everyone is treated equally and everyoneâ€™s needs are accounted for.   <p>





California has a complicated history, from its first colonization by Spanish missionaries to the rancho system, where land tracts were given to favored people as rewards, and then the Homestead Act, which tried to democratize things.  One of the ideas of old West we respect was to take care of strangers and passersby â€” in a world without infrastructure, all people had was each other.  <p>





Los Angeles is now bursting with infrastructure, and a lot of it doesnâ€™t work.  We have less public green space per square mile than New York City.  The idea of the commons was never particularly Californian, but itâ€™s rooted in human culture: a space thatâ€™s shared by all, not just to look at but to graze our animals and raise our food.  The commons werenâ€™t about ownership (which was shared) but about use: who could use the land and the things it gives us.<p>





Fallen Fruitâ€™s public art projects have really arisen in the context of Los Angeles and its strange mix of density and neglect.  The public agrarian experiments we propose are uniquely suited to our climate â€” not just the weather but also the culture.  Fruit is a great tool for sociallyminded artists because it never exists in isolation.  Someone grows it (often in California), someone picks it (often an underpaid migrant worker), and others prepare it, serve it, and then consume it.  Our work strives to connect all these relationships in surprising ways.<p>





None of the fruit commonly eaten today is native to California, though much of it is grown here.  We work with that fact, and see the way a bunch of fruit hanging over the sidewalk in Alhambra is also an invitation.  Itâ€™s a symbol of bounty and generosity.  Itâ€™s an invitation to a stranger, perhaps to you.  ","Forty years from now, Los Angeles would have a completely different landscape.  All arable land would be adapted to generate fruit and produce.  The city would be a kind of permaculture food forest.  This doesnâ€™t mean that it wonâ€™t be beautiful.  We take advantage of the natural beauty of fruit and fruit trees, the fragrance of their flowers, and the soothing charm of their green leaves â€” all demonstrated to improve mood and quality of life.  <p>





The outlook at the moment is grim.  Southern California shows the highest rates of growth in California, the fastest growing state in the country. LA County will increase by 3.5 million people by 2050 while neighboring Riverside County to the east will follow closely, adding almost 3.2 million people. LA will continue to be the largest county in the state, topping the 13 million mark by midcentury.  <p>





Many of the metrics in the LA2050 Report are interrelated in complex and subtle ways.  Cultural vitality stimulates education by provoking young peopleâ€™s curiosity in the world around them; good education opens the way to good jobs.  Environmental quality and social connectedness impact health, which lays the ground for a good life, and our housing improves when our neighborhoods improve because happy, healthy people care about them.  <p>





In 2050 we want an integrated planning system that takes all our needs into consideration, without making every place or every person the same.  Our needs include how we eat to how we work and share space together, needs that are material, and linked to health, to needs that are elusive, like the effect of natural beauty or a perfumed breeze.   The vision we propose is poetic perhaps, but it is rooted in this place, and its ambitions are social, political and utopian.  "

<ol><li><strong>Reviving an art form</strong>


<p>Hearing someone's voice is not the typical way we learn about stories. We consume stories largely through visual images. It's time that we train our ourselves to listen. The Moving Voices of L.A is innovative in that it will revive this timehonored way in conveying and receiving the stories of our communities, adding richness to the arts and culture of Los Angeles.</p></li>


<li><strong>Training community artists</strong>


<p>Moving Voices of L.A will train young adults in capturing stories of their communities through the voices and words from people around them. Every week, field interviewers will capture a story from the 16 cities, diverse ethnic migrant communities that make up the South Bay. Through the community's voice, stories will come alive, guiding the growth of the community. Training and support will be provided by experienced cultural workers with graduate degrees in social documentation, cultural anthropology, public health, and interactive journalism.</p></li>

3102088,2013088,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/filmanthropos.html,Empowering LAUSD with a Transmedia Education Platform for Change, Education,"<p>Filmanthropos is a transmedia production studio headquartered in Los Angeles that specializes in humanizing social issues through creative uses of film and new media. Using storytelling as a platform, we help social enterprises build relationships that lead to measurable change. </p>





<p>Having worked with nonprofits addressing LA's weak public education system, we have seen that LAUSD students' themselves recognize and care about very specific issues pertaining to their district and teachers. </p>





Of these issues, the most prominent include:</p>





<p>1  Inability to transfer into ""better"" schools because of perceived negative stereotypes</p>


<p>2  Inability to learn through creative means as teachers tailor </p>lectures to only ""leftbrained"" students</p>


<p>3  A desire to overcome drug abusive in order to learn</p>


<p>4  The role ""bullying"" plays in school</p>





<p>We find it sad that such young and bright students have identified specific weaknesses and challenges within LAUSD, yet have no voice or sense of empowerment to do something about it. </p>





<p>Filmanthropos' idea is to build a transmedia platform for longterm impact that empowers students to voice these concerns, propose solutions, and encourage teachers, school districts, and politicians to get involved and care enough about these issues to take action. </p>





<p>A story is the most powerful form of influence. This interactive transmedia platform will hold a collection of realtime, interactive stories from students, teachers, afterschool programs, nonprofits and social enterprises addressing education, and other stakeholders involved, with the aim to tie these stories and people together in building a comprehensive solution for LAUSD. This platform will highlight every perspective of the problem, and is designed to encourage every stakeholder to create his own content  the purest form of authenticity. </p>





<p>Our stories are our assets. They can engage audiences to care enough about a cause to take action. We believe that by building a ""story world"" that showcases authentic and empathetic stories about problems with and proposed solutions for LAUSD will evoke themes of change and hope that will engage others on an emotional level. Problems with LAUSD cannot be addressed overnight, and require the effort of a collective pool of students, teachers, districts, parents, organizations, and politicians in order to be successfully resolved and enhanced. Once we have built a â€œstory worldâ€ of masses of people engaged, these masses will combine their efforts to tackle LAUSDâ€™s shortcomings and create change â€“ moving our education system from its current status significantly hindering human development to significantly enhancing human development by 2050. </p>","While Filmanthropos is a fairly new social enterprise that was founded in Q4 2012, we are proud to have connected with several social enterprises to create powerful stories that engage their audiences to elicit change. On top of this, we have provided USD 10,000.00 in probono services to nonprofits to date  a number that is rapidly and continuously growing, as we are now institutionalizing our probono service offerings. 


","<p>We are currently collaborating with afterschool organizations, university film and new media departments, and transmedia consultants in our work. We intend to bring these collaborators in on our ""Transmedia Education Platform for Change"" project once additional funding is secured. </p>

<p>3  Filmanthropos Advisors: Matthew Manos, CEO of Very Nice (www.verynice.co) & JeanMichel Arnoult, CoFounder & Advisor of Crowdfunder (www.crowdfunder.com)</p>","<p>Success will be measured by:</p>


<p>1  Increased number of individuals actively signingup on and interacting on the platform</p>


<p>2  Number of stakeholders connected to each other as a result of the platform (ie after school and summer enrichment program signups)


<p>3  Highschool completion and droprates that can be attributed to the support system this platform provides</p>


<p>4  College going rates contributed to the support system this platform provides </p>


<p>5  Increase in test scores due to teachers and districts being held more accountable for the quality of their teachings</p>","This project will hold all stakeholders involved in and affected by LAUSD's shortcomings accountable. Once voices and concerns are amplified and a masses of Angeleno's are engaged in making critical improvements to LA's education system, the cause itself will have a ripple effect that puts LA in the spotlight to improve its current state of education. 





By highlighting stories of both cases  positive and negative  from students, parents, teachers, afterschool programs, and the like, others in LA struggling with similar issues will be able to learn from and be inspired by one another's experiences. 





The underlying purpose of the project is to create accountability. By creating a massive, interconnected, realtime ""story world"" that addresses very specific problems with LAUSD and creative solutions for addressing its shortcomings, those in LA responsible for the problems and issues with our education system will be held publicly accountable. On top of this, afterschool programs, organizations, and enterprises available to LA's K12 students will gain more exposure and support to expand their services once their impact has been highlighted. ","Success would be a world in which every stakeholder involved is not only empowered to voice their concerns and issues with LAUSD, but held directly accountable for their actions, or lack of action, and their decisions. 





Success would be an increased amount of students completing high school and attending college as a result of success stories and the support system derived from a transmedia platform for education. 





Success involves improved test scores because teachers and districts embrace other forms of creative learning to help rightbrained students grasp and understand difficult leftbrained concepts. 





Success involves attracting support for after school and summer school enrichment programs to extend their services as a result of showcasing their tremendous impact. 





Our goal is to change our education system from its current status of significantly hindering human development to significantly improving human development by 2050."
3102089,2013089,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FLOW.html,Jobs for LAâ€™s Cleantech Future: the FLoW Multiplier Program, Income & Employment,"<p>We propose the creation of the First Look West (FLoW) multiplier program, to harness the boundless energy of the entrepreneurial university youth who care passionately about the environment and the city they live in to anchor an apprentice type of job creation program. This program would reach across the cultural and economic divide, and target their young and ambitious counterparts in the underserved communities. </p>





<p>First Look West (FLoW, http://flow.caltech.edu) is a program for developing college students into the next generation of entrepreneurs and business leaders. As such we actively support the formation of cleantech companies in Southern California, particularly LA County. This business plan competition reaches out to students throughout the region, asking them to identify the biggest challenges in clean energy or the environment, and to create innovative solutions that will grow fast and disrupt the marketplace. We provide these teams with mentorship and training to define the technical and business aspects of their ideas, and so form viable companies. We also connect these companies with entrepreneurial and apprenticeship programs, as well as potential investors, partners and customers. All entrants receive this mentorship and education, but the winning teams receive up to $100,000.00 in cash as well.</p>





<p>The FLoW multiplier program will be run as a pilot involving startup companies in two sectors: sustainable environmental products and solar energy, two target areas that have a good mixture of engineering/manufacturing and marketing needs that can provide a foundation for the apprenticeship program. This consists of two parts:   providing job opportunities in fast growing new startups, and supporting education and mentorship/training for these young people.</p>





<p>The Job Opportunities element will involve competitive grants (potentially with matching grants from local, state or federal government agencies) to support one apprentice per company enrolled in the program as a parttime employee. They will join the team as an intern, but could graduate to becoming a full time employee over time, perhaps eventually receiving an equity share in the company.</p>





<p>The Mentorship/training component focuses on imparting practical entrepreneurial skills to both the university innovators and the apprentice employees. The FLoW multiplier program will provide access to boot camp training run by our partners, and will host training events at local colleges and universities. For the first, we will offer entry to excellent boot camps such as the UC Davis Green Technology Entrepreneurship Program or Draper University, and access to the wellestablished Cleantech Open program and award fellowships for individuals to travel and attend. FLoWâ€™s own program of mentorship and training will feature a series of practical workshops, given by experienced experts on topics such as company formation, marketing, team building, and product development.</p>





<p>This program will have a direct impact on the LA 2050 income and employment indicator by creating new companies in the region, and a framework for placing cleantech jobs that impact multiple points of the LA economy, including manufacturing.  Therefore, it will also have a significant impact on the education and environmental quality indicators, perhaps as important as the effects on income and employment.</p>





<p>The First Look West program began as a partnership between USC, UCLA, and Caltech, and has expanded to include colleges and universities throughout the Southern California region and the west coast. The FLoW Multiplier program will significantly strengthen FLoWâ€™s capability to help new companies form. By anchoring this initiative in the Los Angeles region, we are creating a hub for cleantech entrepreneurship that will lead bright young entrepreneurs from many backgrounds to remain in the area.</p>","<p>FLoW was created in October of 2011, and the first mentorship program and competition took place in the spring of 2012. As a result of that first operational cycle, we were able to leverage limited government support from the DOE into a vehicle that has attracted widespread stakeholder support and partnerships of benefit to young entrepreneurs, the cleantech workforce and ultimately the economy. Some numbers from the first year of the competition best illustrate our organizationâ€™s achivements:</p>





<p>	The competition drew 83 teams from 34 universities throughout the west coast, including more than 20 from Southern California</p>





<p>	Young entrepreneurs developing energy from waste water treatment, robots for cleaning solar panels and solar cell films with 20% more efficiency took the top prizes at the regional finals competition.</p>





<p>	Fifteen teams continued after  the competition to form new companies</p>





<p>	Four raised additional money, as much as $250,000, directly from their connection to FLoW.</p>





<p>	Jobs created: based on the first year exit survey, 23 of these early stage ventures, intended to add 110 jobs over the following 18 months, according to a survey.   </p>





<p>	Teams from Flow have proceeded to join in regional and national business development programs, including the LA Cleantech Incubator, the Cleantech Open, and the UC Davis Green Technology Entrepreneurship Academy.</p>





<p>	The program established a dual track program embracing Business Ready and Transformational Idea Award tracks to ensure great student ideas donâ€™t get lost for lack of support</p>





<p>	The program achieved a partnership with the Southern California utilities, who are looking for technologies and talent</p>","Existing and potential future partners include:


USC, UCLA, Caltech, the Cal State University system, PCC and other community colleges, among many other colleges and universities. We are also partnered with the United States Department. of Energy (DOE), the LA Cleantech Incubator, the LADWP, Southern California  Edison and Sempra Energy, the Cleantech Open, the UC Davis Green Technology Entrepreneurship Academy, and Draper University and  the network of Angel investors throughout Southern California. The additional funding would allow us to expand this partnership network even further.


","The ultimate long term metrics for success are the number of new companies formed and number of new jobs created in the Los Angeles region. We will also measure the number of new ventures â€œspun outâ€ from these partnerships by young entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds. Along the way, we will also collect statistics on the number of participants that continue in training programs, amount of investment/financing raised, and technologies created/licensed. Success for us also means new partnerships among the educational institutions in the region and other city and county job creation efforts.","The FLoW program will create new cleantech companies in Los Angeles. This will mean highquality, better paying jobs for the underserved communities in Los Angeles. It will also help provide a skilled workforce and idea pipeline for the already growing cleantech community in the region. By basing these companies here in Los Angeles, LA will become the test bed for the next generation of clean, energy efficient technologies, which will meet the regionâ€™s ambitious clean energy goals, and will improve environmental quality.","The best measurement of success regarding income and employment would be the creation of new companies formed in the Los Angeles region, providing highquality cleantech/environment jobs for the local workforce, partnered with training programs to grow that workforce. It would mean attracting a consistent flow of investment into these companies, leading to the establishment of a true cleantech entrepreneurial ecosystem. Such an ecosystem builds on itself, luring bigger corporations to establish a manufacturing or R&D facility in the city. Success would also mean new initiatives between the universities and local community colleges and city and county programs to create leadership roles for energetic students regardless of background."

First Star and UCLA work together to develop curriculum, identify educators, course selection etc. The programâ€™s formal evaluation team comes from the UCLA Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, and they have been instrumental in developing the logic model for the program.





We've also collaborated with the Department of Children and Family Services, the LA County Board of Supervisors, the Alliance for Children's Rights, United Friends of the Children and the Bruin Guardian Scholars for participant recruitment, county support, legal assistance, tutoring and peer counselor support respectively. ","Indicators for education outcomes include: 1) high school grade point averages from one high school semester to the next, 2) successful completion of appropriate high school courses and examinations, 3) improved knowledge of the processes for entering postsecondary education, 4) an understanding of the linkage between education and success, 5), development of a commitment to learning, 6) development of career awareness, interests, and aptitudes, 7) investigation and analysis of different career paths to inform future decisionmaking, and 8) development of job search, application, and interviewing skills.


Indicators for psychosocial functioning outcomes include studentsâ€™ development and demonstrated use of: 1) negotiation and persuasion skills, 2) mentor relationships, 3) positive peertopeer relationships, 4) positive adultyouth relationships, 5) social supports, 6) external supports, 7) understanding and appreciation of diversity, 8) commitment to service and advocacy, 9) selfawareness, including selfreflection, 10) selfesteem, and 11) emotional selfregulation skills.


Indicators for selfsufficiency outcomes include studentsâ€™ development of: 1) problem solving skills, including adaptability to life transitions, 2) selfadvocacy skills, 3) the ability to use time constructively, 4) life skills, including financial literacy, resource management, the ability to identify transitional living opportunities, and emancipation, and 5) healthy habits, such as engaging in health promoting activities (e.g., hygiene, healthy diet, disease prevention).


We track and monitor all indicators of progress with the assistance of the Social Research Methodology Evaluation Group (an independent evaluation team affiliated with UCLA). The SRM Evaluation Group has implemented a mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative data collected from studentsâ€™ public school records and report cards, surveys, regular interviews, focus groups, observations, and social service agency case files. Data is collected, analyzed, and reported throughout the program, generally during three periods â€“ the fall and spring semesters of each academic year and in the summer, during the oncampus, residential immersion component.  Our results will inform programming for the next year of operations (summer oncampus immersion and monthly followup meetings until the students graduate from high school. In addition, our progress, challenges and lessons learned are informing the implementation of other First Star Foster Youth Academies around the country (those already operating in Rhode Island and the Washington, DC area and others in development).","Our project will benefit Los Angeles by addressing the abysmal educational outcomes for the foster youth population of Los Angeles, the largest in the nation. 





Current outcomes for foster youth in Los Angeles are dismal. After leaving foster care, approximately 64 percent of young men experience incarceration , and approximately 60 percent of young women become pregnant by age 20 , and 24 percent of these young people will have experienced homelessness , creating a repetitive generational cycle of chaos, poverty and poor outcomes that are expensive in both human and fiscal terms.  Of the approximately 5,200 youth who age out of foster care every year in California, the cost to the state, counties and cities is estimated to be over $165MM per year for those that are incarcerated, become homeless, and/or pregnant. See Appendix V.





On average in Los Angeles County, only 50 percent of foster youth graduate from high school , far underperforming the average of 70 percent among youth not involved in the foster care system . Furthermore, only 3 percent graduate 2 or 4 year college , even though over 70 percent express a desire to participate in higher education.  A study of dropouts by UCSB calculates that for each youth that drops out of high school in California, the economic loss over their lifetime is estimated to be $386,666 per youth. 


","In the year 2050 we hope to have changed the face of foster education in this nation.  





We hope to have First Star Academies operating on university campuses across the nation. When a University President is asked what they do at their University they will have a three pronged answer; 1) educate undergraduates and graduate students 2) conduct research 3) do our part to ensure the nations foster youth are able to gain admission to and obtain a college education."

When the user first runs the app, she picks a team aligned with one of the 8 categories. The user is identified in the game with a badge all players belonging to that category have as their avatar.  The app shows a map centered on the userâ€™s current location that highlights locations nearby associated with one of the 8 indicators.


</p>


<p>


Via monitoring checkins, tagged photos and hashtags, users â€œvoteâ€ with their social actions.  By checking in at a Library points will be awarded in the Education category, for example. Or, tagging a picture at a farmers market scores points in the Health category (for organic food).  Through the course of the game, points are tallied up in each of the 8 categories.  At the end of the gameâ€™s run, a donation will be made to a charity related to the winning indicator.

<p><h4>


LIVE MONTHLY SCAVENGER HUNT


</h4></p>


<p>


To promote competitiveness and encourage personal exploration of the issues in realworld locations, users can also participate in live monthly challenges to score bonus points for their cause of choice.


</p>


<p>


Each month, the app will launch two quests related to one of the 8 indicator categories. These quests will deploy as scavenger hunts in the Los Angeles area, showcasing realworld locations. 


</p>


<p>


Using Augmented Reality technology, players scan landmarks, signs, and other features at real Los Angeles locations to receive the next clue. Once the final clue has been scanned, extra bonus points are awarded to the playerâ€™s cause.

3102092,2013092,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FoodForwardLA.html,Food Forward: Connecting Angelenos Through Local Food Abundance, Social Connectedness,"<p>While there are several indicators that Food Forwardâ€™s work addresses  such as Health and Environmental Quality  we are focusing on our impact on Social Connectedness for this funding opportunity. According to the LA 2050 study, our county fares poorly on several indicators of social connectedness:  Los Angeles ranks 46th among the largest 51 metro areas in volunteerism; Angelenos are less trusting of their neighbors than the nation as a whole; and fewer Angelenos expect to stay in their community for five years or more compared to the national average. </p>





<p>Food Forward offers solutions to these negative trends by providing over 4,000 volunteer opportunities this year, in multiple languages, and as a result connects a myriad of communities across Los Angeles County. If awarded, LA2050 funding would allow us to deepen our highly effective work in areas such as South LA and the San Gabriel Valley. In less than four years since its founding in 2009, Food Forward has established itself as the largest volunteerpowered urban gleaning program operating in California. </p>





<p>We implement innovative strategies that bring people together, often in neighborhoods they would otherwise have never visited, to rescue fresh and nutritious produce from local sources, produce which would otherwise go to waste, and put it in the hands of those who need it the most.  Operating just in the greater Los Angeles region, over 5,000 Food Forward volunteers have recovered and donated a cumulative 1.37 million pounds (over 6.5 million servings) of fresh produce from public and private land, wholesale markets and several of our cities largest farmers markets.  Our programs convert food (and environmental) waste into a sustainable supply of healthy and nutritious produce desperately needed by local communities and hunger relief programs, which in turn has a huge positive impact on the health of people in our community. </p>





<p>Food Forward operates almost exclusively through social media and relies solely on volunteers to carry out our produce recovery activity.  This design not only allows us to operate more costefficiently than other hungerrelief nonprofit organizations, but it provides an ideal mechanism through which engaged community members are connected with each other, with new geographies within Los Angeles and with the rich agricultural history of the region.  Through Food Forward, volunteers work shoulder to shoulder with other volunteers, nonprofit organizations, farmers, landowners, and corporations with whom they would otherwise not likely have contact.  Together they are gaining a deeper understanding of how our personal involvement in the processes of growing, sourcing and distributing food can directly reduce hunger, combat food waste and reengage with Los Angeles as a past and present agricultural landscape.  Engaging in backyard harvesting or recovering produce at a local farmers market are dynamic experiences that empower community members to be actual agents of change.</p>





<p>Over 85% of Food Forwardâ€™s volunteer events are regularly oversubscribed and have waiting lists. Through the LA2050 program, our organization would have the opportunity to dramatically expand our key produce recovery programs by capitalizing on the large number of Angelenos who are willing and waiting to contribute their time, energy and food resources to reducing hunger in our communities.  By the end of 2013, Food Forward would like to see our Farmers Market Program expand from five to nine local markets throughout Los Angeles County and bring backyard harvesting to new neighborhoods, particularly in the San Gabriel Valley where there are tremendous untapped resources such as volunteers, mature and unharvested fruit trees and numerous farmers markets. </p>","<p>Since its founding in 2009, Food Forward has engaged thousands of volunteers (who donated over 18,500 hours of service) in nearly 900 harvests, recovered a cumulative 1.37 million pounds (or 6.5 million servings) of fresh produce from public and private land, wholesale markets and farmers markets, and distributed it to over 50+ hunger relief and social service agencies in the greater Los Angeles region. In August 2012 we created the highly impactful Farmers Market Recovery program that is currently operating in five of LA's most robust Farmers Markets and has collected 83,535 lbs, engaged 195 farmers as donors and 414 Angelenos as volunteers in less than one year.  </p>





<p>We are proud to say that our work has received considerable recognition.  Executive Director Rick Nahmias was winner of the LA Social Venture Partners Fast Pitch Audience Award and Impact/Innovation Award in 2010; a speaker at 2011 TEDx Los Angeles at USC; recently selected as a ""New Food Hero"" of 2012 by Vegetarian Times Magazine and Ecocentric Blog; and in 2012 was chosen as one of two Southern California delegates to Slow Foodâ€™s biannual Terra Madre in Torino Italy.  In 2011, Food Forward was also the youngest recipient of a Carl and Roberta Deutsch Foundation Halo Award for fostering outstanding volunteerism.  Our accomplishments are also receiving increasing attention from dozens of media outlets including the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, Huffington Post, GOOD, KCRW, KPCC, KPFC, LA Daily News, and NPR's Marketplace.</p>","Our work would not take place without the critical yearround engagement of our corps of over 5,000 existing volunteers. Our primary partners are the over 50 hunger relief agencies that receive our produce. We also partner with nearly 195 farmers at five local farmers markets and hundreds of homeowners who donate their produce. We have partnerships with Huntington Gardens and Cal State Northridge and host regular gleaning events with 50 â€“ 300 people bringing in tens of thousands of pounds of fresh produce monthly. Most recently we expanded our partnership with LA City, and now serve as their primary gleaning group at major municipal parks, increasing our gleaning opportunities by 300 percent. ","<p>Food Forward carefully tracks all of our metrics, including produce recovery accomplishments (total pounds of produce collected, number of properties gleaned, and total number of servings provided to local hunger relief programs) as well as our volunteerbased metrics (number of volunteers engaged and hours donated).  This information is used to evaluate the success of and finetune our projects and programs and to develop future goals.  We also conduct regular surveys with each of our partner groups (volunteers, property owners, receiving agencies) to learn about their expectations and experiences.</p>





<p>We will measure the projectâ€™s success using baseline produce recovery and volunteer metrics from 2012.  Each year Food Forward increases its capacity by 15 to 30 percent and we hope to see the proposed expansion result in 25 to 50 percent capacity growth in 2013. Specifically we expect to achieve the following:</p>





<p>1.	Volunteer Base â€“ We would like to see our volunteer base increase by 25% (from 5,000 individuals in 2012) and the number of volunteers in leadership positions to increase from 40 (in Dec 2012) to 50 by the end of 2013. </p>








<p>2.	Volunteer Events â€“ We would like to increase the number of harvesting events by 50% (from 20 per month in 2012), and up to eight of these events each month would be in San Gabriel Valley, and two in South Los Angeles.  We would also like to increase the number of volunteer opportunities for the Farmers Market Program from the current 25 slots per week (at five markets) to 45 slots per week (at nine markets) by the end of 2013. </p>








<p>3.	Volunteer Hours  Together this increase in the number of volunteer opportunities would result in an increase of 40% in total volunteer hours donated over the year (from 7,370 harvesting hours and 585 volunteer farmers market hours in 2012).</p>








<p>4.	Produce Rescued â€“ Through the expansion of both our backyard harvesting and farmers market recovery efforts, we expect to increase the amount of fresh and nutritious produce delivered to hunger relief agencies by 20% (from 157,000 pounds harvested and 55,000 pounds recovered from farmers markets in 2012). </p>","This project will impact Los Angeles by actively engaging over five thousand residents (in 2013 alone) â€“ of the most diverse backgrounds â€“ in gleaning and recovery programs that build community, increase civic participation and renew the belief that we can all play a direct and vital role in reducing hunger among Los Angelesâ€™ most vulnerable. As we continue to promote our mission and accomplishments, we believe we can educate thousands more residents about their important role as a human bridge that connects the abundance of Los Angelesâ€™ untapped resources to those in need.








The end goal of these efforts will be the distribution of several million servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to hunger relief agencies, which will directly benefit over 500,000 hungry and food insecure Angelenos annually.  According to the LA 2050 report, highpoverty neighborhoods typically have less access to healthy food options and fresh fruits and vegetables, which negatively impacts the health of people living in those communities. Our work to distribute fresh produce offers a solution to the current crisis plaguing many of our lowresource communities. The produce Food Forward rescues is feeding a wide range of people in Los Angeles: 58% of the donated produce goes to Latino populations, 53% of it goes to women, 39% of it goes to children, and about 10% of it goes to elderly. This is critical work given the marked increase in hunger, homelessness and food insecurity documented by organizations such as the Study of Homelessness and Poverty at the Weingart Center, the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. 








Food Forward is proud to offer community members a multitude of ways to become engaged.  Our programs cover large portions of Los Angeles County â€“ from Santa Monica to Covina and Claremont, from Hollywood to Woodland Hills, and from Pacoima to Downey and Torrance. Individuals of all ages, demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and physical abilities have the opportunity to volunteer time (at more than 50 food recovery events each month), offer their properties for harvest, or directly recover food themselves.  








Our website indicates which events have Pick Leaders fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Korean or Vietnamese. These events not only engage volunteers in harvesting activity but also educate them on hunger, food waste and the untapped agricultural legacy of the Los Angeles region. We understand that the Los Angeles population is aging and we pride ourselves in offering various opportunities for aging and less ablebodied individuals. Additionally, we indicate which events are appropriate for families with small children. We also offer a number of events that are easily accessible by public transportation, which increases accessibility and volunteer diversity throughout all our programs.","<p>A successful LA 2050, is one where Angelenos take responsibility for the health, happiness and wellbeing of fellow Angelenos. It is a place that is known for its thriving and diverse communities, for the friendliness of its residents and for the innovation of its organizations, businesses and policy makers. It is also place with no foodinsecurity, where everyone  no matter what neighborhood they live in or their socioeconomic condition will have easy access to affordable healthy food. Food Forward contributes to this vision and will continue to strive for a socially connected and healthy Los Angeles.</p>





<p>We foresee Food Forward being THE bridge between abundance and need in the food space across Los Angeles County and Southern California.  By 2050, Food Forward will have long become an institution in the region and will have branched out to numerous other counties and even states across the sun belt, while keeping Los Angeles as its nerve center. Food Forward will have a food recovery model that is manageable for small standalone neighborhoods while robust enough to engage and supply food to vast institutions such as the LAUSD. The result will be numerous volunteerpowered hubs working in unison to create a sustainable fair and just food system that guarantees fresh local food for all in and around Los Angeles. </p> 





<p>When people think of ways to be part of the solution to end hunger, curb food waste or be engaged with people in their community, Food Forward will be the default organization, much the same way Tree People is for reforestation, or Heal The Bay is for coastal clean up.</p> 





<p>We see Food Forward as playing a critical role in the development of a smarter and more efficient food distribution system for all citizens of LA 2050, continuing to advance and stay on the cutting edge of our pioneering blend of hitech social connectivity (through smart devices/web solutions) paired with the most basic of activities: gleaning of local food that would otherwise go to waste.</p>





<p>We will continue to use food justice as the broad and powerful canvas for our work, expanding and deepening our harvest and recovery, while augmenting it with dedicated education programs and robust social enterprise that will provide jobs to people wanting to work in the food justice arena. At Food Forward we envision an LA 2050 as one in which the public immediately recognizes the abundance already present in our everyday lives â€“ and innately values it as a resource and a solution.</p>"
3102093,2013093,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FLAADanceBachata.html,Shall We Dance in LA?,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"For Learners of All Ages believes in developing innovative solutions to the challenges facing our community by cultivating collaborative lifelong learning. 





It was difficult to ultimately select the most relevant indicator for our organization's proposed projects. Though intersecting with education, social connectedness, we believe that through cultivating and enriching arts and cultural vitality these other pieces fall into place. 





The arts in public schools continue to suffer from budget cuts. With increased focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in K-12 education, remaining funding is centered around related subjects. The arts, and in particular, dance, is being pushed aside as less relevant.





For many students, it is the artistic, cultural, creative, and physical elements of the school day that keep them coming back and staying academically involved. At the same time, it is these same elements in our communities, city, state, and nation that draw people in and motivate them to invest themselves. 





For this reason, many students from the Northeast San Fernando Valley are bused to other parts of the Valley and City or to private schools where holistic education takes place.  At the same time, this is the reason why Northeast Valley residents commute to Hollywood, Downtown, and Santa Monica to invest their recreation time.





But change is in the air. 





To this end, our My LA 2050 idea is:





1) to implement an after school Bachata dance program in four high schools in the Northeast San Fernando Valley and at Los Angeles Mission College





and





2) to create a dance festival based in the Northeast San Fernando Valley serving as a culminating event for our students, a major artistic/cultural community event, and a way of showcasing vital community resources, in this case the Boys and Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley.

















","For Learners of All Ages was incorporated 6 months ago.  We received our 501c3 charitable status in February of this year.  





A baker's dozen in size, our staff includes credentialed teachers, one active and one former university professor, a former engineer who helped put man on the Moon, a former United States Marine, community college students, as well as university graduates and post-graduates.  We are each linked by our commitment to cultivating the minds, bodies, and spirits of our community. 





We have gained support for our dance programming from the LAUSD and Polytechnic High, Sylmar High, and the Cesar Chavez Learning Academy.  Los Angeles Mission College and the Boys and Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley also have welcomed our proposed project.





While we have only listed our involvement with four public schools, our programming has been requested at several other schools. Being that we are a new organization, our programs are fresh, and we have no current funding we have decided to focus our energy on a handful of schools for the time being. We are far more interested on the quality of our work and the growth of  our students.





Initially, our dance programming focuses on Bachata, however, the Island Touch Dance Academy has provided us free use of their choreographies, including Crunkchata, which is an individual-based dance more appropriate for younger dancers. We have other dance companies, ranging from Mexican Folklorico, hip-hop, and even the flow-arts who would like to work with us. However, we first need to set our initial programming successfully in motion.


","The LAUSD, three of its schools, Los Angeles Mission College, the Los Angeles Education Partnership, the Neighborhood Councils of the Northeast San Fernando Valley, Island Touch Dance Academy, the Boys and Girls Club, and Heroes of Life are, and will continue to play pivotal roles in the execution of this and other programs.  





Our organization is very young and started out six months ago with zero community partners. But, with the support of these and other organizations, we have been able to grow considerably in a very short period of time. ","Success will be measured in a variety of ways:





1) Students will learn and be able to perform 15 basic and 10 intermediate Bachata dance steps, understand the musical structure of Bachata music (time signature and instrumentation), know the origins of the Bachata dance style, and have an appreciation for a variety of Bachata musicians. 





2) Students will be able to create and perform their own unique Bachata choreographies;





3) Diverse community events are and will be created, and our dancers will have opportunities to perform on the public scale in a variety of venues. Aside from instructor-based assessments, these performances will enable FLAA to measure the growth of dance skill of our students; 





4) Students will be provided Health and Wellness assessments when starting and finishing our programming.  They will also develop their own wellness goals. In this way we will be able to document what they learned. Our assessments are based on California Education Code and recommendations made by the Health Department;





5) A major point of emphasis is lining up our after school programming with in-school (between the bells) learning. We, along with Island Touch Dance Academy and the LAUSD, want to create physical education alternatives that include our dance styles and projects. Part of determining our success will be accomplishing this objective. To take this to the next level, we are also focusing on aligning our instruction with the philosophies/styles of the Common Core Standards, the new learning model to be introduced during the next academic school year in the LAUSD and across the state of California. 





Our ability to support teachers and schools on this regard will be a key factor to determining our program's success.","Our dance programming will benefit Los Angeles in many ways. 





-We will be programming to LAUSD schools that desperately need support. We are doing this at no cost to the LAUSD or to students;  





-Through our projects, we are enabling communities like Sylmar, San Fernando, Arleta, and Pacoima to diversify their community-based cultural events. Two such events, the Sylmar Health and Wellness Fair and the Sylmar Olive Festival are coming up, and we are already on board in terms of providing performances and other support. 





-The second aspect of our proposal creates a new dance/arts festival. While this first year will, at this point, be one day long, this is only the beginning. Our focus is creating events for our students to showcase themselves and connect with their peers, community members and leaders, and dance professionals. This winter's event will have a corresponding event at the end of the spring school semester. Summer students will also have their own culminating event. Alumni of our programming will be welcome to continue in our projects and events, creating a sustaining community/family.





As a small, new organization, For Learners of All Ages is using these events to create and support more programming and public activities across the 10 communities we are pledged to serve: Sylmar, San Fernando, Pacoima, Lake View Terrace, Sunland, Tujunga, North Hills, Mission Hills, Panorama City, and Arleta. 





Our activities will also serve as a model for other parts of the San Fernando Valley, and the city and county of Los Angeles, creating sustainable, duplicatable programming with  documented, peer-reviewed results that translate on school records, greater and broader cultural and business activity, and overall community value. ","In the year 2050 we expect to see a healthier, more vibrant, and community-minded constituency in our neighborhoods. We intend to see greater academic success in terms of both students and educational institutions. We are focused on project-based learning that is then applied back to the classroom, and we will see more and more education taking place within the community itself, not just confined to a campus or between the official school day. The arts are key to the growth of cultural identity and vivacity, and their growth will make our schools far more attractive to students and beneficial to their intellectual, physical, and emotional development. The success of our dance projects will help propel our other aspects, in particular music, forward as well as other niche interest areas that otherwise wouldn't exist. Among our youth there are future costume designers, set creators, program developers, film creators/producers, and on. Through what we are doing now, we will enable these niches to open and get exploited. For Learners of All Ages is committed to the entrepreneurial mentality, and we are going to instill it through diverse methods, including dance, music, and academic-supporting programming.  We am witnessing a transformation in the education-community relationships  ourselves, K-12 students. We are focused on the eventual melding of community and school campus, where youth and adults alike work together on project-based learning projects, where youth and adults alike share business interests, professional and personal pursuits, and community sustainability.  These projects have already started, but by 2050 we expect this type of action to be the standard practice within the LAUSD and to have become a model template for communities across the county, state, nation, and globe. While we create all of this, we are documenting, as this is in many ways a research experiment. We anticipate studies to be published over the upcoming years. With all of this said, when it comes to dance, ultimately by 2050 we anticipate living in a world where it is a staple of our educational system and used as a way to integrate academic success, emotion-based learning, and community/activity-based service."

With <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em>, ForYourArt pairs artists and urban visionaries together to imagine stops along a 36hour itinerary in L.A. circa 2050. Through a series of roving conferences and an exhibition, <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> culminates in a futureforecast map stimulating thinking and creating new possibilities for our collective future.</p>





<p>International arts figures will be invited to participate, broadening the reach of this conversation and integrating their perspectives to reflect the international nature of our city. </p>





<p>Additionally, building upon the conversation started by LA2050, <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> will utilize LA2050â€™s eight welldefined success indicators as a touch point in discussions leading up to and during the roving summits.</p>





<p>According to the <em>2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy of the Los Angeles Region</em>, 1 out of 8 regional jobs is in the creative economy.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where 1 out 3 regional jobs is in the creative economy and this sector moves from the 4th to 1st largest employment cluster including an even more flourishing artist sector.  Likewise, the Goldhirsh Foundationâ€™s <em>LA2050 Report </em>that sites that L.A. ranks near the bottom of large U.S. cities for volunteerism.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where everywhere is a creative context and we have at least double social connectedness from 21.5 to 43 percent  deeply increasing our civic and social engagement.</p> 





<p>What would our Los Angeles look like and how would an Angeleno or someone visiting spend 36 hours in the city in 2050?</p>





<p><em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> creates a crossdisciplinary and participatory platform for visioning LA2050â€™s arts and cultural indicator and what everyday life will look like in L.A. 2050.  Specifically, utilizing an April 3, 1988 <em>Los Angeles Times Magazineâ€™s</em> 25year look ahead to 2013 article as a reference point, the project will future forecast art centric visions of L.A. 2050 through an exploration with artists, architects, creatives, thought leaders, institutions and more, answering these questions: </p>





<p><em>In 2050:</em> What kinds of new creative economy jobs exist? What ethical shifts will have taken place? What does an â€œartistâ€ do? What new landmarks will we have? What new kinds of organizations will we have? What will arts organizations look like? How will Angelenos spend their time in a 24hour day? How might arts organizations evolve as part of this growing ecosystem?  How will arts and culture spur civic connections and engagement? What does L.A. as an arts and cultural capital look like? </p>





<p>The future forecast information collection will be multifold and will include roving talks and presentations taking place at 34 venues across L.A.  all over the course of 36 hours.  Conversations will be documented and inform an exhibition at ForYourArt at 6020 Wilshire Blvd.  Through an invitational and open call process, artists, architects and others will be invited to exhibit their artwork, their ideas or concepts for â€œ36 hours in L.A. 2050.â€</p>





<p>The conversations and exhibition are followed by a publication, <em>MAP: ForYourArt L.A. 2050</em>.  The overall activities and vision of <em>36 Hours  in L.A. 2050</em> will be captured in this â€œfuture mapâ€ that looks 37 years ahead to 2050.  The map will include an invitation to meet up at an L.A. landmark in 2050 on a certain day and a 36hour 2050 itinerary.  ForYourArt will also utilize its platforms and partners to stimulate conversations around the forecasting and to further engage participation. </p>


","<p>ForYourArt creates new contexts for art on and offline and applies an entrepreneurial spirit to producing and distributing artistsâ€™ work. ForYourArt experiments with a range of activities in its 6020 Wilshire Blvd. space that fall in between the nonprofit and the commercial sectors  generating patronage through conversations, popup shops, creative interventions, artist initiatives and family activities. </p>





<p>ForYourArt has worked on significant projects including The Gettyâ€™s <em>Pacific Standard Time</em>, and the Hans Ulrich Obristâ€™s <em>The NOW Interviews</em> at the Venice Architecture Biennale, featuring interviews with leading artists, architects and urban planners by the celebrated curator. ForYourArt has published art maps for Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Chicago and developed an iPad app with artist John Baldessari. </p>





<p>ForYourArt also organized the public art component for <em>Arts Matter</em>, a first of its kind, citywide public art exhibition and fundraising campaign to support arts education in the nationâ€™s second largest public school system. Presented by the Los Angeles Fund for Public Education (LA Fund) and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), <em>Arts Matter</em> addresses the importance of arts education in Los Angeles public schools, the â€œcreative capital of the world.â€ Artists Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari created public art works that were presented on city buses and other outdoor media all across the greater metro area.</p>


","For <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em>, the anticipated partners and collaborators are many including Los Angeles art and architecture schools, arts organizations, museums, artist, architects, urban planners, arts and service nonprofits as well as many business and technology entities and their innovators.  ","<p>Success will be measured through the strength of the visions presented for places and experiences.  <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> will be an opportunity to deepen engaged networks around these common visions for success in the future, and spread these ideas about Los Angeles internationally. </p>





<p>Illuminating summits, an exhibition, and a map and its contents will be the results of this project.  Along with the field, these activities will provide new access points for the public to participate in the conversation, be inspired and emotionally connected to L.A.â€™s arts and cultural community of the future. </p>





<p>ForYourArt is also a platform to explore new business models and ways for artists and institutions to monetize their value independent of the existing arts marketplace, which functions successfully for fine art.  As we imagine every artist as an entrepreneur, too, in L.A. 2050, this project also seeks to explore future art practices.</p>


","<p>By creating an independent space for thinking about what â€˜36 hours in L.A. 2050â€™ will look like in the future, the project will generate concrete visions around places and experiences that reflect ideas, conversation and collaborations towards a general consciousness of L.A. in 2050. </p>





<p>Whatever unfolds here continues to heighten L.A. as a leading cultural arts capital and spurs new inventions.  </p>


","Success in the year 2050 would have many embodiments including: increased art and cultural patronage for institutions and artists; free museum admissions across the city; access to quality, sequential arts education for all public K12 students; healthy, wellfunded government cultural agencies providing grants to nonprofits and artists; spaces and programs that support artist as entrepreneur and social practitioner; deep civic and social engagement including robust board governance, artists serving on public commissions, etc; easy use of public transportation to get to and from event venues, and more. Additionally, public policies that support: artists/creative live/work spaces, affordable artist housing, temporary and public art programs; engaging spaces; innovation in architecture for public buildings, more open space, incubator programs, etc."
3102095,2013095,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/virtualmentor.html,Virtual Mentor Program for Foster and Atrisk Youth, Education,"I would use $100,000 to shape the future of Los Angeles by applying this money to the development and implementation of the Foster Care Counts Virtual Mentor Program that is currently being conceived by Foster Care Counts, a 501c3 corporation whose mission is to improve the lives of foster youth in Los Angeles County.  Although I believe that a mentor can help a foster or atrisk youth with any if not all of the challenge areas proposed in LA2050, I propose that Foster Care Countsâ€™ Virtual Mentoring Program will create positive change in the area of education, as educational achievement continues to be one of the major impediments foster youth face in our country today.  Although 70% of our nationâ€™s foster youth desire to go to college, only 3% of them are able to graduate with a degree.  After fully developing a bestpractices virtual mentor program, I propose to use this funding to pilot a mentoring program to assist current and former foster youth to both enter as well as remain in the following postsecondary educational institutions in Los Angeles: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, and Cal State Los Angeles.


Background


There are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles.   This is by far the highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States.  Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. 


Foster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives in rates that are astonishingly higher than their nonfoster peers.  Upon becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and mental health problems when compared with their nonfoster peers.


For example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation,  in 2011 approximately 22% of former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9% of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population, and somewhere between 2535% of former foster youth have been incarcerated compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001; Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk, & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R. L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima et al., 2000)


Moreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to the national average of about 30%.  Of the foster youth who do enter college, almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through college without the support network of a family.


There is a tremendous amount of peerreviewed literature analyzing both the barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as adults.  In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most if not all of the challenge areas included in LA2050, and could benefit from assistance directed toward each one of these arenas.  I believe that a mentor would have the flexibility to be able to assist foster youth in many if not most of these challenges, and that if the foster youth population could be significantly assisted, we might see other atrisk populations become included into this model, with the ability to positively impact the statistics in each of the LA2050 challenge areas.

","I plan to partner with Guardian Scholars organizations at the following Institutions: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, Cal State Fullerton.  Guardian Scholars is an oncampus support organization to support foster youth in college.  I plan to partner with two state licensed clinical psychologists who have prior experience with foster youth, one of whom has done a great deal of consulting for Los Angeles County. I plan to collaborate outcome research with the University of Southern California, with whom I am collaborating on other outcome research related to the foster care system.","I can perform evidencedbased outcome studies to either show that virtual mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and their ability to complete college, or that the program does not provide the anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would outweigh the costs.





The project will be evaluated by comparing an experimental group of foster youth college students who have virtual mentors to a control group of foster youth college students who have similar demographic characteristics who do not have mentors, and, controlling for various extraneous environmental circumstances, determine whether foster youth in college who have mentors exhibit statistically significant higher rates of graduation than foster students in college without virtual mentors.","Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating better citizens and a better city. A myriad of resources exist to support my assumptions about the potential benefits of providing mentors to youth who lack the support and guidance of a stable family.  M.R. Munson et al. found that â€œolder youth exiting foster care value having someone that maintains contact, stays by their side, and is simply there for themâ€ (Munson & McMillen, 2009). Samuels and Pryce found that young adults more often seek instrumental forms of support, such as help with housing, but that their pride may hinder them from asking for emotional support (Griffin et al., 2011; Samuels, 2008). Data from this study revealed that both of these forms of support were perceived by the foster youth as valuable. Leadbeater & Wayâ€™s study on young adults  reported that they often want another person in their lives that will hold them accountable and set limits (Leadbeater & Way, 2001). Finally, the National Mentoring Partnership (2004) found that an online mentoring program taking place between 20022004 â€œbolstered mentees' selfesteem, literacy and future orientation.â€





Why virtual mentors? There are two main reasons. First, in reading the existing literature about the most established facetoface mentoring programs, and surveying adult peers about their potential willingness to be a mentor, it seems that one of the main impediments to peoplesâ€™ willingness to be a mentor is the expectation that the mentor commit to a regularlyscheduled, minimum amount of time spent with the mentee, not including travel time and having to juggle unexpected conflicts and the vagaries of todayâ€™s overcrowded lifestyles.  


This seems to be a commitment that may feel overwhelming for the average bright, accomplished, busy individual who could probably REALLY help a youth navigate the complexities of his or her own life if the volunteer had the flexibility to make this commitment fit within his or her own set of obligations. Indeed I myself have always wanted to be a mentor or big sister but have always hesitated when trying to imagine myself fighting traffic to get to East LA by a certain time to meet a vulnerable kid waiting and wondering if I am going to show up and then there is an accident on the freeway and one of my kidsâ€™ schools calls to inform me that a kid is sick, etcâ€¦


The second reason virtual mentoring makes sense is that todayâ€™s youth are potentially as or more comfortable with online communication as they are facetoface communication. Additionally, given that many foster youth have issues of trust and attachment, a virtual relationship may feel safer and less overwhelming than a traditional facetoface relationship with a stranger who looks like the many other adults who may have already disappointed a mentee.


","Of the 70 % of foster youth who wish to attend and complete college, I would consider my program successful if a statistically significantly greater number of youth were able to finish college with the help of a virtual mentor than are able to do so today, if the model of virtual mentoring were extended beyond the foster care system to all atrisk populations, and if there were government incentives available to those willing to be virtual mentors because the benefit to society far outweighed the taxpayer cost of the incentive.

3102096,2013096,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Freewaves.html,OUT THE WINDOW: Videos on LA buses ,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"PROJECT SUMMARY 


Out the Window will transform our daily commute. A million Angelenos will wake up and go home not to the drivel of commercial TV but to innovative, informative videos that not only teach them, but also engage them â€“ surround them in art. How? On the bus! Yes, the bus â€“ reversing the popular vision of transit from a drudge to a recharging experience â€“ aiding in our efforts to create a multitransit Los Angeles, while bringing art (real, experimental art) to people who often feel locked out of the cityâ€™s museums and galleries. Art should be, will be everywhere. Out the Window makes that happen.





FULL PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION


Bus riders, Out the Windowâ€™s target audience, are 2/3 Latino, half female, half under age 34 and predominantly low income, a difficult demographic to connect to inexpensively. Reaching this population of 1,000,000 riders per day with transformative health, social, and cultural information during their daily commutes improves the quality of life, increases riders, creates urban dialogue, treats people as people instead a pair of consumer eyeballs.  The buses can be our mobile art  museums for everyone.  





Out The Window videos will be:  


â€¢	1/3 by artists on the full breadth of issues of concern to them 


â€¢	1/3 about community health such as access to nutritious food, obesity amelioration, and promotion of healthful lifestyles and 


â€¢	1/3 about other issues, such as environmental, educational and social, produced by LA nonprofit organizations.   


â€¢	A portion of each category will be made by LA youth enrolled in video programs.


â€¢	also appear on outthewindow.org  and Freewaves facebook page daily  for  viewersâ€™ comments and sharing 





In 201314 Out the Window will present 312 videos, (6 per week) each with an openended, pointed question in English and Spanish to which viewers may respond via text.   The combination of message and feedback loop will be a powerful carrier of vital dialogs by, about and in Los Angeles among the 85% of riders who use cell phones.





Out the Window uses Transit TVâ€™s video system on all 2,000 L.A. Metro buses, reaching Los Angelesâ€™s residents with creative and essential messages while providing free culture on the largest art distribution system in the country to the nationâ€™s most populous county.  





This program is ready to fully established this year. It launched in 2010 with a MacArthur grant; it tested technologies, networks, viewers and programming in 2011. It gathered resources in 2012 and now is ready to take off with all elements in place!  





IMPACT ON THE ARTS AND CULTURAL VITALITY


Sociopolitically, the arts increasingly reflect the everwidening divergence of economic, educational and cultural access facing Los Angeles and the nation.  This may be observed in the unfortunate schisms between socalled â€œhighâ€ and â€œlowâ€ culture; and between profitdriven mass culture and artistinitiated personal and community expressions.  





Freewaves believes there are many good solutions to close the gap. Through its unwavering faith in every person to understand idiosyncratic artistic styles and ideas, Freewaves asserts the human right of every person to access their communitiesâ€™ artistic expressions.  





Freewavesâ€™ optimism is firmly based in the statistical analysis of our 540 interviews undertaken during the pilot phase of Out the Window.  Specifically, 91% of bus rider respondents indicated they liked art.  Half found that art was present on the bus, in some form, while half did not perceive any art on the same buses.  Of the respondents, 73% regularly watched the TV programming available on all L.A. Metro buses.  





The programming tells stories, shares creative impressions and offers critical insights about Los Angeles. See www.outthewindow.org/videos for previous examples of the artistsâ€™ videos that reflect a range of subjects and styles including performances in urban public spaces, background information about LA neighborhoods, animated scenarios, ruminations about nature and investigations of other art forms.  





The next round of videos on the buses will add issues impacting health, such as: availability of affordable, healthful exercise options, regional disparities in health and nutrition services and dangers of lead paint and asbestos. 





The busriding population has profound health needs; many commuters traverse neighborhoods lacking access to nutritious food, parks, and adequate health and wellness resources.  Furthermore, because 33% of bus riders lack Internet access, consuming mostly mainstream media, bus riders comprise an expensive demographic for health service providers to reach.





Videos will be made by many of L.A.â€™s media artists, ranging from emerging to established, plus students in the region.  After consultation with health and wellness specialists, they will eloquently and entertainingly address specific health issues and point the public towards affordable or costfree solutions. ","<p>Since its inception 24 years ago as an umbrella organization uniting the many diverse media voices of greater Los Angeles, Freewaves has pioneered artistsâ€™ use of every new development in the field.  </p>





<p>Beginning with its successful efforts to bridge the 1990s divide between mostly small, culturally specific media arts centers, Freewaves has established itself as one of the most adventurous advocates for raising media arts to a truly democratic vector for ideas and images.</p>





<p>Freewavesâ€™ activities have consistently been in the vanguard of the field, models for others to emulate.  Specific areas in which it led the way include:</p>


<p>â€¢	Placing experimental media arts in public spaces, reaching hundreds of thousand of people who may never have seen art in this genre;</p>


<p>â€¢	Showing 3000 artistsâ€™ works</p>


<p>â€¢	Producing 11 festivals celebrating the newest artistic developments;</p>


<p>â€¢	Positing live internet links as an art form;</p>


<p>â€¢	Positioning interactive media (CDRoms) as predecessor to web interactivity;</p>


<p>â€¢	Placing experimental media arts on cable, PBS and public access television, plus in all L.A. libraries and high schools;</p>


<p>â€¢	Presenting large format, video display of experimental media arts on video billboards previously dedicated almost exclusively to paid advertising;</p>


<p>â€¢	Engaging international, webimplemented curation of its festivals, using the latest web technology to stream hundred of hours of video worldwide;</p>


<p>â€¢	Offering workshops bringing new media technologies to underserved communities and to working artists seeking new avenues of expression.</p>


<p>â€¢	Exhibiting videos at Hammer, MOCA, LACMA, Getty, and 100 other venues</p>





<p>Out the Windowâ€™s excellence has been acknowledged with numerous extremely competitive grants from MacArthur, Rockefeller, Warhol, Durfee and Irvine Foundations, National Endowment for the Arts, California Arts Council, Los Angeles County Arts Commission and The City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and others, leading to two critical awards: one of L.A. Weeklyâ€™s Top Ten Art Projects of the Year, and Public Art Reviewâ€™s Top 50 National Projects of the Year.</p>"," Transit TV, whose 4,000 busbased video monitors, will display a continuous onehour loop of programming on all L.A. Metro buses.  





The UCLA Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance (REMAP) is supplying the interactive tech methodology and implementation.





Echo Park Film Center and Public Matters will provide many of the student videos.  





USCâ€™s Price School of Public Policy and Annenberg School of Communication will advise on health content and sharpen the evaluation process.  ","Freewaves is working with specialists such as Professor David Sloane, an expert in health policy and neighborhoods at USCâ€™s Price School of Public Policy.  He has identified realizable criteria and methodologies, to be facilitated by graduate students, which will provide assessments of Out the Windowâ€™s impact on bus riders. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches are being developed to assure a statistically and anecdotally useful set of materials for future projects. 





A questionnaire codesigned by various specialists and administered at bus stops in past iterations of Out the Window has been refined for 2013 for three stages: the beginning, midpoint and end of the project.  With a target sample of 250 interviews per round, we will assess how repeated, daily exposure to the project has impacted the bus ridersâ€™ awareness of issues and appreciation of art. If funding permits, we will also run focus groups about the videos in advance of the bus screenings.


","Out the Windows will benefit Los Angeles beyond its impact for â€œArts and Cultural Vitalityâ€.  By using the indicator that is performing well, art in the public sphere, Out the Window will assist four other of LA 2050â€™s key indicators.  





Health: Perhaps one of the most pressing issues facing bus riders is health access, a key issue being addressed in this proposal.  One in five Californians are uninsured, and in many districts of Los Angeles this number is even higher. Out the Window will provide Angelinos with key information about specific health issues and means to address them including motivation and methods to access insurance and enroll in the Affordable Care Act/California Exchange.





Environment: With so much of our current health inextricably tied to environmental issues, the art of Out the Window will impact this key indicator with informative videos geared to individualsâ€™ efforts, showing what can we do to improve and protect our environs.  





Social Connectedness:  Los Angelesâ€™ social connectedness will be enhanced through the public exhibition and the interactive aspects of the project.   The project will create opportunities for bus riders to engage with each other, local organizations, students and artists by responding to the videos.  It will also inevitably incite dialogue with other bus riders, their neighbors, communities, etc. 





Education: Out the Window will create a more informed, curious and motivated artmaking and consuming public. Students who can publicly display their labors will more likely continue making videos. From this increased visibility, a percentage will find the inspiration to utilize the evergrowing means of creating video, encouraging a new generation of video makers, writers, animators etc. to advance the aesthetic and social power of communication in an era of social media. 





We have already commissioned the following notable artists:


â€¢	Mel Chin, world renowned artist, to address lead prevention in L.A.


â€¢	Yoshua Okon to examine food industry and childhood obesity 


â€¢	Poli Marisol to explore mental health in relation to food consumption 


â€¢	Lisa Marr and Paolo Davanzo to look at diverse cultureâ€™s health practices 


â€¢	John Jota Leanos to describe environmental justice


â€¢	Ann Kaneko to show the visible and invisible benefits of Chi Gong 


","<p>Art is passing from isolation, to intervention, to participation, to engagement, to a glorious ubiquity in which currently accepted and recognized disciplines and aesthetics evolve into new forms of public art.  With the blazingly fast developments in technology, we have witnessed an integration of disciplines, in which computing and telecommunication devices have fostered a new hybrid of public and private art, one that, by 2050, will have taken forms beyond prediction.  Art will be everywhere, an integrated member of society for all.  </p>





<p>Out the Window will play a significant role in that evolution, hastening the democratization of art and communication through its daily dissemination to the bus riding public and, in the future, to other constituencies whose daily lives bring them into contact with videos, handheld devices and means of sound and image distribution birthed by todayâ€™s technologies.  </p>"
3102097,2013097,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MakingitHappen.html,Digging Deeper/ Making Connections/ Doing Better, Social Connectedness,"We propose to integrate 4 tracks of existing and new activity initiatives for greater depth, synergistic connections and â€œdoing more betterâ€ for our youth and community as follows:





Young Docents and Young Docents After Hours - continuing and deepening the experience for LA County high school students to receive paid employment and training through hands-on cross use customer service business, public speaking and problem solving skills plus direct experience of museum operations, and program development and delivery.





Artpreneurs program enhancement with 10 increased opportunities for participation and promotion fostering creative and economic vitality for visual artists through monthly on-site vending and marketing opportunities to the public.





Kids Gloves project to be tested with our YDs to empower learning and pride in uncovering school and neighborhood history through professional experiences in cataloging & preserving historical artifacts, gathering oral histories and determining if we can replicate the program for at schools throughout Los Angeles. 





Art on CAAMâ€™s Footprint program which is a 2 year program designed to develop deeper community based relationships and engagement in the placement, curation and creation of CAAMâ€™s exterior footprint as a â€œgalleryâ€ for public exhibition 





For 6 months we would blend and cross purpose these initiatives for a more integrated and richer public, experience for both our youth, audiences, general public that will not only meet the arts and cultural vitality indicators, but also serve as boosters for education, social connections, and provide direct impact on income and employment for area youth as well as the overall enhancement of the physical Exposition Park neighborhood and environment. 





","Despite the economic downturn and budget reductions we have grown attendance at CAAM over the last 10 years from35K to over 100,000 visitors representing an average 20% increase each year.  We are now presenting 80+ public programs each year and 9 â€“ 13 exhibitions while continuing to maintain an active and growing research library and collection.  We are proud of these numbers and equally as proud that they represent a connection to content that has ranged from presenting the more than 20 exhibitions that have been directly related to telling the story of the African Diaspora around the worldâ€¦and all still for Free Admission!  We have proudly collaborated with numerous organizations from the Skirball Cultural Center to the Japanese American National Museum, the Chinese American Museum and others like Self Help Graphics to the obvious connections with the Watts Towers, St. Elmoâ€™s Village, and commercial galleries owned by African Americans.  We encourage artmaking and training by children and showcase the work of other organizations serving this purpose like Ryman Arts. But perhaps we are just as proud of our outreach efforts with Target that were designed to allow us to showcase the achievements and contributions of the African American and collaborative communities through our Target Sundays at CAAM programs.  Through this effort, we have not only created places for the community to showcase what they do but this showcasing of talent also included bringing to the public important discussions and representatives that could assist with everything from healthy living to safety in the water.  Target Sundays even helped us create our Artpreneur program making it possible for solo art entrepreneurs to have a place to sell and expose audiences to their work and earn income accordingly. Our most heartfelt achievement is the growth of our Young Docents program having grown it from a 2 person 4 week program that is an integral part of our program today employing, training and educating 30 high school youth year round for their personal and professional career development.","Role of Partners in Planning and Implementation (if any): The California African American Museum (a State Agency) provides the facility, utilities, equipment and co-workers that drive our mission; Funding Donors, such as Target, Bank of America, Annenberg Foundation, Department of Cultural Affairs, Los Angeles County Arts Commission, SEMPRA Energy, SCE and others generously fund programs through our Friends Foundation; People of the African Diaspora, African American Artists, Collectors, History Makers and Gallery Owners who through their need, support and participation drive our mission and increased the demand for continued growth and vitality. ","For the Young Docents we have evaluation forms that are regularly used to assess the individual students and the program as a whole. Students keep journals, are tested on information, given feedback and opportunities to lead tours, assist guests and engage in other projects and research.  We determine success by not only the number of students that complete the summer portion of the program, but by the increased number of students that want to return for the year long portion of the program.  The increased number of applications further advises us that there is a need and we seek advise from consultants and specialists for improvements.  The deeper offerings centered around graphic design, AV tech training, social media protocols and direct engagement with the community for the YD participants under this grant would be scrutinized in the same manner.





For Artpreneurs we seek to increase the current 25 art vendors on our roster by another 10 participants having customer access.  This program is evaluated based on the number of returning vendors which is currently at a 75% success rate in terms of returning Artpreneurs.  Having resources to expand outreach and promotion for this program should increase vendor sales and CAAM attendance simultaneously, and the quantity and quality of artist entrepreneurs seeking to participate.  We will count these increases accordingly as a measurement of the programâ€™s success.





Kid Gloves is a new pilot and if it works with the Young Docents, we will seek to have the YDs be part of a professionally led team that goes into the schools to share ways in which the program can become part of a classroom or an after-school club experience.  We seek to have this program achieve a greater awareness of neighborhood, history and relationships between cultures as neighborhood demographics evolve.





Art on the Footprint at CAAM is the other new initiative which is developing and going into operation this fall.  With each phase we will have an exhibition and increased engagement with the community not only participating in workshops but serving as community curators selecting art to be on the exterior of CAAM and in the making of such art.  This program digs deep to create long lasting relationships that will also evolve and morph as we get further feedback from and engage the community.


","Some suggest that museumâ€™s have largely supplanted churches as institutions that are emblematic of American cities.  For the California African American (CAAM), situated in the heart of LA, this is idea applies as related to the on-going challenge of engaging a multiplicity of demographics and subjects matters.  At CAAM we go beyond daily programming to invest in developing human infrastructures and relationships that will serve the unmet needs of the local and larger community, and bring together the experiences of generations.  It is in this context that we seek support for our multifaceted vision to â€œDig Deeper, Connect the Dots & Do More.â€





CAAM is physically located in a neighborhood that was residentially Black through a good part of LAâ€™s history.  It is also in the midst of a fairly dramatic demographic shift.  While nestled across from USC, the 2000 US census reveals an Exposition Park neighborhood that is 21% African American, 57% Latino and 11% White.  This is also a very working class neighborhood grappling with difficult socio â€“ economic issues such as 40% of families living in poverty with an African American unemployment rate at 13.8%, higher than any other ethnic group.  CAAM has met this shift employing youth; providing wider opportunities for people of all backgrounds as a part of our exhibitions and programs; welcoming all as a part of the story of art and history that we recount from an African American voice; and promoting artists as entrepreneurs to strengthen their position economically.  





Even in the United Kingdom, where tradition is almost holy, they recognize that museums in the future will be â€œless about us as the guardians of collections and delivering our services to communities and more about us facilitating communities to celebrate their own heritage and create their own experiences using our resources (collections, buildings, people etc).â€(Keith Merrin)  Since our 1977 CAAM has embraced these concepts.  Progress in the past 10 years in the past includes an increase in collaborations and outreach despite the economy.  We are responsive and are comfortable letting our audiences have a say.  This is what CAAM has done, but we need to better connect the dots between what has worked, where we have found surprise gems, change as needed and reach a new better.  We exist on a mission that requires the integration of all facets of life for public engagement and enhancement.  A world that requires multi and cross-cultural, discipline, education, economic, skill recycling and social integration is not new territory for CAAM.  This is not and never has been a â€œtraditionalâ€ museum, and we are proud to be grounded in such a wide berth, but now is the time for us to dig deeper into our foundation to find ways to connect successful initiatives, and incorporate in necessary elements in order to reach better.  ","By 2050 we fully expect CAAM to have moved into its expanded 172,000 sq ft facility that will provide better storage, classrooms, multi-use presentation spaces, a larger library and exhibition galleries as well as greatly improved physical presence in the park and in the neighborhood.  However, we are driven first by further providing the content and programs that we think are vital to our relationship in this neighborhood.  We seek to have strong give back programs like the ones we describe in this application to be a part of our base of operations in the same way that we began our Young Docents program16 years ago with only 2 students being served. We will remain responsible for employing our youth, providing Art on the Footprint so as to create changing and engaging experiences for our Park users.  Even pieces created today will be a part of our collection and the history of our neighborhood.  Our Kid Gloves project will be a regular part of school education outreach efforts as new generations of students need to remain connected to their school community, even if they are bused into the area.  Success for CAAM is a full integration of all of the multi-facets of art and culture, education, employment and income, and neighborhood enhancementâ€¦these are the elements served by our mission but expanded upon to include even greater community input and involvement."
3102098,2013098,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/NETWORKandNATURE.html,Network and Nature:Identification and Implementation of Community Green Spaces within Los Angeles, Environmental Quality,"The first Angelenos were once referred to as ""the People of the Earth"".  Why not return to the past? Why not implement a proven way of life that reigned and prospered for centuries while inhabited by the first, original Angelenos:  The Tongva? 





Our goal is to create a planning and implementation tool that will assist in the realization and installation of simple landscape based interventions.  When applied, will create a network of community greenspaces within Los Angeles.  The manual will lay out details on how to create greenspace networks in lowincome communities and how to design them with the utmost respect to the environment.





With Los Angeles County being 96% developed and built out, is it even possible? Yes it is.  From Lot to Spot and SWA Group would like to create a planning and implementation tool, with specific design guidelines for specific communities to create a network of community greenspaces in Los Angeles. Given the opportunity we would  provide communities, city officials, friends and neighbors a tool to create needed  greenspaces throughout Los Angeles.  


","From Lot to Spot (FLTS) is a 501c3 nonprofit founded in 2007 as a direct result of the relationship between lack of accessible greenspace and the quality of life in lowincome neighborhoods.  FLTSâ€™s unique approach involves grassroot, community engagement to ensure disadvantaged communities contribute their voice in developing healthy spaces in their neighborhoods.  In the last five years, FLTS has worked on healthy living community engagement projects in the cities of Inglewood, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lynwood. 2012 was a landmark year for From Lot to Spot.   FLTS constructed and opened the first ever community garden in the community of Lennox, CA. , opened the 118th/Doty Ave Pocket Park: the first communitydesigned pocket park in the City of Hawthorne.  In collaboration with SWA, we planned, funded and constructed a 9000 sq.ft. recreation space along the Dominguez Creek that was designed and implemented by high school students and community members.





SWA projects span over 60 countries and have garnered over 700 awards.  In 2005, SWA received the Landscape Architecture Firm Award, as designated by the American Society of Landscape Architects.  One of the seven SWA offices is located in Downtown LA and is continually excited about the opportunity to enhance the city we live in.


","From Lot to Spot (http://fromlottospot.org/) will be partnering with SWA Group (http://www.swagroup.com/).  FLTS is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving blighted, urban neighborhoods in the greater Los Angeles area one vacant lot at a time.  SWA is a world leader in landscape architecture, planning and urban design with a passion to create exceptional places for people with an emphasis on natural systems and art.","In the end, the success of our efforts will be echoed as part of a larger initiative to regreen Los Angeles.  The success of our efforts will be reflected by the agencies we will inspire to adopt the ideology of this level of greenspace construction.  And the benefits will be seen directly by the community members we work with.  If encourage one park building agency  to adopt the idea that bringing nature back to Los Angeles in the form of creating access to greenpace in low income communities does not have to cost millions and take years, then we have succeeded. 


This noted, we do have specific measurables that we would like to attain. The success of our efforts will be measured by the number of greenspaces created after the launch of the manual. From Lot to Spot and SWA will collect baseline information from specific communities where we will be marketing the manual to public agencies, community based organizations and any interested green space builder. From Lot to Spot has a goal to create 5, 10 and 15 interconnected greenspaces within a 2, 4, and 6 year timeframe that will create green networks in Los Angeles communities. In addition, to ensure the greenspaces are successful, we will measure the quality of the projects and their impact in the community with postoccupancy community outreach through extensive engagement.


","Can you imagine, a Los Angeles with a large system of parks, gardens, microspaces, plazitas, parklets, pedestrian walkways that lead to and from work, play and living spaces?   By taking simple ideologies of space, connectivity and landscape, Los Angeles can become a beacon for urban environments around the country.  


We want the community to be involved in the planning and construction of greenspaces in their own neighborhoods, to make a deeper connection to their environment.  The manual will provide communities with a guide for identifying greenspace opportunities and designing costeffective solutions, and implementation which will help to see projects built in their communities much sooner than later. The purpose of the manual will be specifically designed for communities based on socioeconomic conditions but can be used by any neighborhood throughout Los Angeles.  As reported in the LA2050 report and several, recent scholarly studies, lowincome, communities of color have the greatest need for access to greenspaces.  The manual will take in mind specific land use opportunities or restrictions, culturallysensitive relationships with space, and other unique community characteristics.  With this framework, the manual will  be able to be utilized and implemented in similar communities and cities throughout the country.  By facilitating the process of creating the needed greenspace in multiple communities, the manual will directly benefit Los Angeles as a whole. 


These are grassroots playspaces, nature spaces, and contemplative spaces.  With the implementation of these greenspaces Los Angeles will reap the benefits of planting trees and vegetation that sequester carbon emissions and improve air quality; designing permeable surfaces such as low/no mow grasses and porous paving will capture and clean stormwater; creating beautiful, clean greenspaces will spur economic investment;  and providing areas where adults and youth can interact with the natural environment in their neighborhoods will create ample health and wellness opportunities by combating nature deficit disorder. In addition, the manual will create greenspaces that will revitalize neighborhoods: studies prove time and time again the more greenspace a community has, the higher the property values.  The aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood due to the addition of greenspace will encourage investment into the neighborhood.





<b>These will be greenspaces that will support communities to thrive, not just survive.</b>   ","Success would be walkable, community greenspaces linked through pedestrian and bicycle friendly pathways throughout ALL of Los Angeles.  2050 would be a year where the biggest greenspace issue is not how to create more access for lowincome communities but how to maintain it.  The manual has so inspired greenspace building that in the most disadvantaged communities, Los Angeles has a myriad of walkways, green alleys, streetscaped medians, pocket parks, rooftop gardens, river bicycle paths, green walls and countless other forms of green space that create interconnecting networks throughout the City. 


Los Angeles 2050 has surpassed greenspace benchmarks and goals, creating significant environmental impacts such as increasing carbon sequestration, stormwater catchment and the supply of clean groundwater.  In addition, surge in greenspace building has significantly increased economic investment in disadvantaged communities and reduced diabetes and heart disease rates.  The impacts of the network of sustainable, costeffective greenspaces are so successful that Los Angeles 2050 is looked upon as a model city for urban centers around the globe.

3102099,2013099,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CBRN.html,Community Builders Resource Network (CBRN), Social Connectedness,"The idea is to identify organizations that are actively engaged in service to their communities, and to increase their effectiveness through interconnectedness, training and support. Social connectedness, put simply, measures how people come together and interact. Believing that relationship development is one of the best means that any person or group can use to gain access to resources, we are starting the Community Builders Resource Network (CBRN). 





What will CBRN do exactly? 





It will make good organizations better.


 


It will do this by providing training in the areas most critical to organizational success: Strategic Planning, Leadership Development, Teambuilding, Compassionate Communication, and Effective Fundraising. As a coalition of the willing â€“ access to training will be made open to any group or organization (regardless of political, religious or sexual alignment) purposed to relieve suffering. Training will be made available for free and offered in both Spanish and English. Knowing that volunteers often play an integral role in these groups â€“ training and workshops will be offered to accommodate a variety of schedules and will include evening and weekend opportunities. 





A foundation from which to build a better LA already exists. By identifying and creating a collaborative network for the already existing 501(c)3 organizations within a community â€“ beginning with service organizations, educational facilities, and faith based organizations â€“ we can better identify a communityâ€™s resources and thus better meet that communityâ€™s needs. 





There are a number of faith based organizations in my neighborhood that sit largely unpurposed during the week. Wonderful facilities with classrooms, kitchens, bathrooms and open areas that could offer any number of community services, such as: childcare, afterschool programs, ESL, literacy, First Aid, CPR, 12 Step programs, food pantries, vocational training, community gardens, etc. - are awaiting inspiration into more directed usefulness.  





The development of more effective social connectedness will not be limited to internally collaborative network, however. A better means of connecting these resources to the public needs to be developed and implemented. A user friendly website that serves as resource index to the public will be developed and maintained as part of this initiative. As representative of a food pantry that serves over 5,000 people monthly â€“ and having worked as a volunteer with this organization for over 20 years, I am personally aware of and connected to a half dozen other food pantries in the Northeast San Fernando Valley. However, I just did a Google search of â€œfood pantries San Fernando Valleyâ€ and none of these organizations came up. There is a disconnect that desperately needs to addressing â€“ yet the organizations involved are generally running with little to no administrative overhead and are often comprised of volunteers for whom website development is either not a priority, or it lies outside of their budget or skill sets.  ","The First Southern Baptist Church of Sylmar (FSBCS), who is the sponsoring partner of this initiative, began a food pantry immediately after the Northridge earthquake in â€™94, as a distributor for FEMA. Since the need to assist the hungry didnâ€™t end once the infrastructure was repaired, neither did the FSBCS. The church is quite small; in fact, it averages less than 50 people a week for its Sunday service â€“ yet it provides food to an average of 5,000 people per month. It manages to do this week after week, month after month, year after year â€“ with a workforce comprised entirely of volunteers. There are no administrative costs or overhead. 





This has been done by effectively collaborating with a host of other community organizations from withing the public and private sectors. As continued recipients of Federal resources, the boundaries between Church and State are clearly understood and respected. ","Kaiser Permanente, L.A.P.D. Mission Station and it's Clergy Council, The Sylmar Neighborhood Council, M.E.N.D., Valley Food Bank and the Rescue Mission Alliance, Los Angeles Education Partnership, The Boys and Girls Club, The offices of the local City Council, State Assembly, Public Works, The California Endowment, and the California Community Foundation, along with more than a dozen Faith Based Organizations, public schools and private schools - to name a few.","Social connectedness is a means of evaluating a group or individuals ability to develop and maintain relationships - here are six of the measurements typically used to measure this indicator: 


1. Duration of relationship


2. Frequency of interaction with the other person


3.Knowledge of the other person's goals


4. Trust/closeness with the other person or group


5. Self-disclosure to the other person


6. Social network familiarityâ€”how familiar is the other person with the rest of your social circle





Detailed internal assessments will be used to determine the current connectivity of all participating organizations. This will identify their current relationships with each other as well as the communities they serve. 





Often, service organizations measure their success based on numerically valuated metrics. For example, a homeless shelter with 80 beds may measure its success based on occupancy. Is the number of slept in beds really the true measure of success, or is the number of people helped to get into permanent living arrangements? How many organizations truly identify through some manner of effective intake procedure â€“ the ongoing needs of those they serve, then develop relationships around lasting solutions rather than temporarily alleviating aids? 





Our assessments will be geared towards accurately gauging these areas so that improvements can then be implemented and measured accordingly.





Until the initial surveys are done, however, the precise areas in need of improvement will not be fully ascertained. 


","Through targeted development of its existing, non profits. If each of them could be improved by 15%, the impact would be profound.","Los Angeles County has 88 municipalities. This collaborative process that we would pilot, is being concentrated in just 2 of them. Success would be this model being tried and proven effective, then spread across all 88 municipalities. "
3102100,2013100,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FulfillmentFund.html,Destination College, Education,"The Fulfillment Fund is a Los Angeles based 35 year old nonprofit that has evolved into a leading college access organization with a multipronged model for success. The Fulfillment Fundâ€™s mission is to make college a reality for students growing up in educationally and economically under-resourced communities. A college degree is more important than ever in creating a pathway out of poverty.  We promote higher education and college bound culture through our high school program in partnership with several LA Title 1 high schools.  Our program is designed around our classroom-based proprietary College Access Curriculum, one-on-one college counseling, and experiential learning opportunities such as college tours and our annual signature event, Destination College.  We are unique in that our program is part of the regular school day, making us an integrated part of our studentsâ€™ school day.  Our holistic approach and commitment of â€œOne Student a Timeâ€ enables us to extend educational opportunity and create long-term positive change for our students, their families and the surrounding community. Numerous students do not see college as a reality due to the cycle of poverty, cost of attendance, and lack of college graduate role models in their communities.  Compounding the problem are budget cuts that lead to overcrowding 1:35 students and few or nonexistent college counselors 1:1250 students in area Title 1 high schools; the Fulfillment Fund is bridging this gap to service these students.  We partner with the schools to provide students with the much needed guidance and information to graduate high school, apply to and attend college.  The education of one student not only impacts the student, but it can also increase the economic growth of their family and surrounding community exponentially.  Our hope for 2050 is that the greater LA community believes in our vision that all students, regardless of their circumstances, should have the opportunity to attend college, graduate, and actively participate in transforming their communities and creating a better society.  Our students are LAâ€™ future business leaders, parents, and community advocates that will help spread the importance of the value of higher education. Our immediate goal for the future is to reach more students, families, and educators by expanding our signature event, Destination College beyond our current students. The Fulfillment Fund has successfully held 16 Destination College events for high school program students, their parents and mentors; it is often the first time many of them visit a higher education institution and begin to see attending a college or university as within their grasp.  





Destination College is always held on a local college campus such as Loyola Marymount University, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Southern California.  Grade specific workshops are delivered by Fulfillment Fund program staff and outside content experts that include: Overview of the 4-college systems, Financial aid options, Personal essay writing, College Applications 101, and Leadership 101. Several workshops, led by professionals in creative fields, incorporate youth development and creative self-expression to further engage students. The event also includes a robust college fair attended by 60 or more national college recruiters who provide general information and address our studentsâ€™ concerns about financial aid, cultural challenges, and support services.





For many students, Destination College is a pivotal, life-changing experience as it marks the first time they realize that they can belong in the college community.  After attending the event, students are armed with critical information and have a sense of empowerment which translates into certainty that they can attend their dream school no matter the cost because they have options.  The event provides parents and mentors with valuable resources and support about the importance of their student attending college in addition to providing guidance on how best to prepare their teens for college.  In LA County, where only  32% of students complete college prep coursework A-G\;  Destination College has the ability to ignite passion in students and stress the importance of succeeding in high school in order to be accepted to college.  





The main goals of Destination College are to:


1.	Motivate students to apply for and attend college by connecting them with college representatives and current college students.


2.	Spread practical knowledge about the college admissions process and financial aid through informative workshops.


3.     Educate more parents in the college going opportunities that exist for their children and help remove the financial barriers they may think hinder these opportunities





","The Fulfillment Fund has been able to gauge the need of the Los Angeles community and build a successful model that works for students.   The Fulfillment Fund provided mentoring to help students graduate high school and educate them about college access.  Through the interactions with students, parents, and educators, we saw the great need for the community to be educated on college acccess for all students especially those in first-generation, low-income or under-resourced areas.  We were able to build on our mentoring program and develop proprietary high school curriculum that is delivered in partnership with schools during class-time and one-on-one counseling through our College Access Program Advisors.  We also have a CAP (College Access Program) Leadership Crew that meets once a month.  





Experiential learning opportunities are provided for the students in our program including college overnight tours and the annual Destination College event.  Destination College has successfully been held for 16 years and we have been able to provide a unique college experience for thousands of high school students.  Fulfillment Fund provides financial aid workshops and also has a robust scholarship program open to students that go through our program.  Parent workshops during Destination College are provided in English and Spanish to help them provide support for their children in high school and college. 





 A testament to our success has been the recent ability to provide the city of Las Vegas the tools to replicate the Fulfillment Fund model as a pilot in their schools.  The participating schools have already started seeing a shift in perceptions on attending college from the students.





The Fulfillment Fund program students have a 90% high school graduation rate compared to 64.2% in LAUSD overall.  In 2012, 90% of our students planned to enroll in college versus 54% of students from low-income communities nationwide.  An impressive 81% of Fulfillment Fund students become the first in their family to attend college, helping break the cycle of poverty in their family and community.





We strive for the students in Los Angeles to have quality college access programs and have an experience similar to Nicole Harris Blackwell. Nicole shared that her family wanted her to be the first to go to a four-year college â€œbut [they] didnâ€™t know how to help [her] navigate through choosing a school or completing applications and financial aid forms.  The Fulfillment Fund was invaluable in helping me to successfully enroll in Spelman College.â€  She is a proud graduate of Spelman College and Claremont Graduate University and is an English professor at Santa Monica College.


","The Fulfillment Fund partners with several Los Angeles area high schools to enroll students for Destination College.  Our goal is to create a college going culture in these schools among the students, parents, and educators.


Partner high schools:


â€¢	New Designs Charter School


â€¢	Gertz-Ressler Charter High School


â€¢	Alexander Hamilton High School


â€¢	Crenshaw High School


â€¢	New Open World (NOW) Academy


Extended School Partners


â€¢	The Alliance Schools


â€¢	Green Dot Schools


â€¢	So CAL CAN- CBO organizations, like USC NAI, Bright Prospects, MOSTE girls, One Voice and CDF


Partner colleges include Destination College host schools as well as admissions recruiters from over 60 college and universities that participate in the event.","We measure success in multiple ways, but our primary indicator is a pre and post survey is distributed to student participants at our Destination College event.  The survey is designed to measure student impact and is reviewed for quality improvement measures.  In 2012, a parental survey was developed and distributed to parents and caregivers that attended Destination College with their students.  These two surveys will be the main form of assessing the event and students attitudes about attending college.  The survey gauges the studentsâ€™ interest in attending college. 





Follow up questions on the survey also help to gain more knowledge about the students and their attitudes toward attending college.  Some of the options students can select for reasons why their interest changed include: 1) participating in the grade-specific workshops; 2) listening to the student panel; and 3) attending the college fair.  For a majority of students, the financial aid workshop impacted their attitude shift because it began to demystify the financial aid process and encourage students to apply for any school of their choice regardless of cost concerns.





Success will also be measured by increased numbers of parental involvement.  Parent involvement is key in the process since a majority of our students (81%) will be the first generation in their households to attend college.  For many of our parents, the idea of navigating the college going process is overwhelming.  Our parents want their children to succeed and often just need a little help to understand how to best they can help their children.  Together with parents, we can educate more students on the importance of attending college and create a broader college-going culture in the communities most in need in Los Angeles.


","A good education is key to helping elevate individuals from the cycle of poverty.  A 2009 U.S. Department of Education study showed that the average income by a high school dropout was $19,540, those with a high school diploma increased to $27,380, an associateâ€™s degree earned an average of $36,190, and a Bachelorâ€™s degree earned more than double a dropout salary at $46,930.  These statistics clearly indicate that the average high school dropout is likely to earn wages that are below the federal poverty level and that the higher the education level, the greater chance for economic self-sufficiency.  Study after study has also shown that a higher education will deter one from crime, lowering incarceration rates and also promotes a higher degree of engagement in community and civic activities.  This project will lead to a better educated workforce and create a ripple effect that impacts students, parents and families, and Los Angeles businesses by 2050.    





The Fulfillment Fund will continue to support college access in Los Angeles while broadening our reach in partner high schools, serving more students and creating school-wide impact.  There is currently a lack of opportunities for students growing up in economically and educationally under-resourced communities to get the help they need to successfully navigate the college going process.  Among our students, the majority - 69% are Latino and 19% are African-American.   A combined 80% of the population we serve receive free or reduced lunch.  Nationally, for students from low-income families, only 54% go on to college as compared to 84% of their more affluent counterparts.  By increasing student and parent participation, we can have a positive impact on these statistics and increase of number of low-income students, in particular the number of Latino and African-American students graduating high school and attending college.  





Our college matriculation rates over the past two years show that, as a result of our services, Fulfillment Fund students are matriculating to University of California colleges at a higher rate than Los Angeles County as a whole by a margin of 3%.  They are also matriculating to California state schools at nearly double the rate of LA County overall (43% vs. 23%).  Expansion of Destination College outside of current Fulfillment Fund students will allow us to serve Los Angeles students and families that are most in need by motivating students and demonstrating that college is an viable opportunity no matter what the obstacles or financial concerns.    ","By 2050, we would like to see thousands of students filling local college campuses â€“ perhaps over multiple days to engage in workshops and college fairs.  Our hope is for first generation students to have confidence that they can and should be part of a college community.  We envision thousands of Fulfillment Fund alumni serving as positive role models for the generations to come and giving back to their communities.  Parents will know that college is viable for their children and will understand how to support them through the college going process.  As our participants in Destination College become the parents, business leaders, educators and community leaders of the future Los Angeles we will shift the conversation in Los Angeles so that all students have the opportunity to attend college regardless of their circumstances.

3102101,2013101,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/schoolgardensforall.html,Asphalt to Apples: Sprouting Healthy Kids and Gardens, Health,"The Garden School Foundation (GSF) has a vision of a Los Angeles community where every child grows, cooks, and eats fresh local produce every day of their lives  in school!  Angelinos should capitalize on our most famous characteristic  fabulous weather  to cultivate a city and county with green space and a bountiful harvest accessible to everyone.  In partnership with the Farm to Preschool program at the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College, which focuses on the early childhood years, we propose the following multipronged idea to get us there:





1) Build the capacity of entire school communities to support the growth of healthy children through Countywide trainings for teachers, parents, and community volunteers to build the skills necessary to maximize the potential of gardens, thus transforming eating habits for a lifetime.


2) Create the first LA School Garden Network Resource website.  While innovative school garden programs exist in the LA region, our urban sprawl tends to isolate programs and schools.  We propose to gather, share and leverage our resources to create a force of sustainable change in the region. 


3) Host a countywide school garden forum and resource fair to gather teachers and garden advocates to celebrate the wonderful work happening while inspiring and supporting others to transform their own schools to include outdoor learning environments.  By working with and learning from each other we can cultivate a community that will nourish and support the growth of the whole child.





Currently, children in LA, particularly those from low income and historically underserved communities of color, suffer from poor health due in part to the debilitating effects of obesity, often stemming from an unbalanced diet lacking fresh fruits and vegetables.  Obesity rates in preschoolaged children enrolled in WIC (Women, Infants and Children) in LA are over 22% among Latino children and over 15% of Black children.  The link between obesity and low access to healthy food in â€œfood deserts,â€ among other indicators, is well proven. Furthermore, we know that if children are eating more fresh fruits and veggies they have a lower risk of developing obesity and obesityrelated diseases such as diabetes, with health effects that could stay with them their entire lives. The good news is that recent studies have shown that if children grow their own food, they are more likely to eat it, a fact that many teachers and parents can testify to firsthand. Given LAâ€™s ideal conditions for growing food and a plethora of unused school land, we can ensure that every child has the opportunity of the benefits of growing fresh food as an integral part of their Prek5th grade education.  This would transform the school and preschool landscape from asphalt to apples and the hundreds of other fruits and vegetables kids can grow!





We propose to cultivate the conditions that will enable every child in LA to grow up having the knowledge, support, and resources at their fingertips to become healthy, connected, and activated adults. This will create a continuum and community of learning from the preschool years through elementary school, using schools as the most obvious setting for change.  Our idea builds on the important work thatâ€™s already being done and sets the stage for transformative change on a countywide scale through capacitybuilding, networking and resource sharing. 





1. Capacitybuilding


Preschool and elementary school teachers will be trained on ageappropriate core standardsbased nutrition, garden curricula from GSF (Seed to Table) or UEPI (Farm to Preschoolâ€™s Harvest of the Month), and basic gardening skills. These curricula effectively link core learning standards such as math, literacy and science to gardens and local healthy food in a schoolbased setting.  In addition, parent workshops will focus on home gardening, affordable healthy foods, empowering parents to find their voice and advocate for healthier food at schools.  Community volunteers will be trained in school garden curricula, garden management best practices, and be connected to existing resources.





2. Los Angeles School Garden Network website


This website will be designed to focus on school garden resources in the LA region, as well as providing up to date information on events and giveaways, and an online forum for parents, teachers and volunteers to communicate and share best practices, challenges, resources, and advice.  





3. School Garden Forum


A school garden forum will culminate the school year to bring together all preschoolgrade 5 schools with gardens as well as those inspired to start their own programs.  This forum will host speakers, discussion roundtables, showcase gardens, programs and resources, provide skill building cooking demos and provide the type of interaction and capacitybuilding movement in Los Angeles that is sorely lacking","The Garden School Foundation was founded in 2005 with the mission to create a model of gardenbased education for Los Angeles schools that would advance health outcomes and experiential learning opportunities for elementary students. Eight years later, weâ€™ve created the most comprehensive program in the city, with students at our pilot site visiting the Â¾ acre kitchen garden every other week during the school day for classes in everything from Science and Language Arts to Cooking and Nutrition. Our Seed to Table curriculum, to be published this June in partnership with the verynice.co design company, is the first of its kind to create a simple, concise, standardsbased framework for integrating gardens into elementary schools, and stands to transform gardenbased education in Southern California for many years to come.





In addition to piloting this program at the 24th Street Elementary School, GSF has worked with Widney High, a school for students with multiple physical and developmental disabilities, to create a Horticulture vocational program that includes a commercial greenhouse operation and vegetable garden. We are working with the school to create job opportunities for these students, connecting them with local urban agriculture organizations and farmersâ€™ markets so they can make meaningful contributions to their local community.





GSF has cultivated a sustained network of community volunteers that contribute over 4,500 hours of volunteer labor each year to our organization. We train 6 interns each semester that go on to hold jobs furthering gardenbased education opportunities for Los Angeles youth, and host hundreds of visitors to our site each year that come to learn from our model.





Our partner, the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College, was instrumental in creating, cultivating and expanding farm to school programs, which are now linked by a national network throughout the United States.  UEPI has many other innovative programs involving research and policy change, including the Farm to Preschool program.  Farm to Preschool is viewed at a model program nationwide, is a national leader of the emerging Farm to Preschool movement, and was given a recognition award by Michelle Obamaâ€™s Letâ€™s Move! Child Care initiative in 2012. UEPIâ€™s Farm to Preschool program partners with child care agencies, preschools and family child care sites, as well as many local and national organizations.  Begun as a pilot program in 2009, it is now expanding throughout the state, has been tailored to Hawaiian culture, and is currently working with the Navajo Nation.  Occidental College was named to the 2013 Presidentâ€™s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction in recognition of its exemplary community service and Farm to Preschool was a featured program.","The Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College is an academic center conducting research and policy work with the aid of strong communitybased partnerships. UEPI has been a strong leader in establishing fresh food programs at both the preschool and public school levels for over 14 years, including for low income preschool and after school facilities. UEPI is also a leader in the emerging national Farm to Preschool movement, creating a network of Farm to Preschool stakeholders across the country.  The Farm to Preschool program brings local, affordable food to underserved preschoolers, their families and the wider community as well as creating a learning environment through classbased lessons and school gardens. ","Both GSF and UEPI have extensively evaluated their programs and have validated survey tools applicable to this proposed project.  To evaluate preschoolgrade 5 teacher trainings (for inclass curriculum and onsite gardening as a teaching tool and for school consumption), teachers will be given surveys at the end of the training to measure effectiveness and perceived increased capacity to offer and sustain this gardenbased program at their school. Success will be measured by the number of teachers in the training who feel confident they can implement the program at their site. Surveys (before and at the end of the program, â€˜preâ€™ and â€˜postâ€™ tests) will be given to a subset of preschoolers (at least 100 children) and elementary students to evaluate any increases in knowledge of fruits and vegetables, how food is grown, and measures any changes in food preferences.  Success will be measured by changes in knowledge and preferences as compared to schools who have not received the program, using data collected from a similar population during Farm to Preschoolâ€™s pilot program phase in 2011.  Increase in healthy food consumption will be measured from surveys given to teachers during the school year, as well as from taste test sheets that record how many children have eaten the produce (such as from the garden) and how many liked it.  Success will be measured by the increased number of children who try the produce as well as like it, over the course of the school year.


 


Teachers and parents will be interviewed in focus groups to assess their knowledge of and    capacities for using gardens as educational tools to promote increased fruit and vegetable consumption amongst children. Parents will also be interviewed as to their knowledge of and desire to create sustained gardenbased programming in their local schools, and the different ways other schools are approaching gardens. Volunteers will be surveyed as to their attitudes about their own capacities to help sustain school gardens and implement programming, as well as their knowledge of local resources available to support their efforts.


 


For the website, the number of web hits will be monitored as well as online forum activity between teachers, parents and other community members.  Success will be measured by an actively used website and vibrant forum that provides technical assistance and troubleshooting to school garden programs.


 


A short evaluation form will be distributed at the end of year garden forum to measure increases in social and professional connectedness among participating schools, increase in knowledge and inspiration from the speakers and other related events at the forum, as well as the interest, drive and capacity of additional schools and teachers to start programs in the 20142015 school year.","Itâ€™s a well examined and researched fact that the overall health of children in Los Angeles is poor, with children as young as age 3 suffering from prediabetic symptoms.  While childhood obesity rates have leveled off in Los Angeles, they continue to be high, with Latino and African American children experiencing disproportionate effects of obesity and related health impacts, due to many factors such as income, housing and food insecurity as well as low access to healthy food with high exposure to calorie and chemical laden junk food.  Children in L.A. and around the country are currently so unhealthy that their life expectancy is projected to be lower than that of their parents. 





Research on school gardens has shown that children eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, perform better on tests, and are more likely to have higher attendance rates when they experience gardening at school.  In addition, gardens have been shown to increase childrenâ€™s sense of ownership and pride of their accomplishments, an essential step toward taking control of their own health. As part of the regular school day, gardens provide a rich experience that improves both the capacity for learning and the ability to make healthy, informed decisions about their diets  and lives.  Even children as young as age 2 can garden and benefit from such experiential activities.  Farm to Preschool has found that children as young as 4 are asking their parents to buy and grow the foods theyâ€™ve eaten and grown themselves at school, something repeated in the feedback Garden School Foundation staff receive about the 611 year olds in their program.





By inspiring, creating and sustaining a culture of gardens at schools, children, their families and their teachers will all benefit.  Benefits are numerous and include (1) greater access to healthy foods; (2) increased consumption of healthy foods; (3) increased learning in all subjects and core standards; (4) skill building through the act of sowing, growing, harvesting and cooking food, as well as mentoring of older children to the young; (5) improved connection to and understanding of the environment that we live in; (6) more visually appealing schools that enhance learning and behavior; (7) a culture of connectedness to our land and each other by bringing schools and the community together; and certainly (8) the culminating effect of improved health outcomes for children as well as their families for generations.","Los Angeles in 2050 has transformed its communities, harvesting its â€œlowesthanging fruitâ€ to make the best use of its most neglected yet abundant resources. In 2050 we see all children eating healthy foods because theyâ€™ve learned how to grow them, and they and their families know that thereâ€™s no better place on earth for kids to grow food and learn outside every day of the year than right here in L.A. Weâ€™ve capitalized upon the fact that LAUSD land is public land and therefore it is and should be open and trusted to the public to gather, garden, learn, play, and collaborate whenever school is not in session. Weâ€™ve created and sustained healthy communities throughout the county, because weâ€™ve learned  and experienced  that in order to grow healthy kids, you have to cultivate their entire community to create a landscape where the HEALTHY choice is the EASY choice.





In this vision, weâ€™ve spent the last 37 years creating and integrating gardens and the growing of food into each and every day of the school year and building the capacity of schools and teachers to harness the full potential of gardens to transform childrenâ€™s health, from birth and beyond.  Weâ€™ve hauled out thousands of acres of asphalt and replaced it with thriving ecosystems full of fruits, vegetables, insects, birds, California Live Oaks, wild Lupine, and native Elderberry trees.  Weâ€™ve bridged the divides of race, socioeconomics, and politics through digging our hands into the soil and cultivating beauty together.  Weâ€™ve created a cohesive community of Angelenos that wonâ€™t settle for anything but the freshest, most delicious, most local, most healthy, most affordable fruits and vegetables for every single child in every city, every day of the year. Weâ€™ve made Los Angeles into the single most shining example of a city and a county that â€œgot it rightâ€ by its children, and has in turn created a population more healthy, more active, and more in control of its health than any other in the country."
3102102,2013102,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/climateleaders.html,Climate Leaders  reducing environmental impact by sharing best practices among local leaders, Environmental Quality,"The mission of Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program (4CL) is to facilitate education on environmental policy implementation to encourage local cities to take action to reduce greenhouse gases in Northern California by implementing best practices used by other local governments. The 4CL Program is modeled after other county networks which have proven to build capacity to the region and we see this model as a perfect addition to the environmental groups in LA county, striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare their cities for the climate changes we are currently experiencing and the larger impacts that are yet to come. Our organization provides local elected officials and staff professionals with uptodate information through a monthly newsletter, fact sheets, and a website with references and links to projects and policies from peer cities in our county and the larger Bay Area. We bolster this effort with a quarterly workshop opportunity to gather facetoface to review, discuss, network and learn about a current topic through several guest speakers and important stakeholders from the area.





Unlike other counties in the Bay Area, Contra Costa County governments have been slower than other governments to address the issue of climate change and we see a similar pattern in the majority of LA County cities. Yet, real action and real implementation is well underway! We see this model as the ideal system for getting LA County to move forward to reduce emissions in order to abide by emission reduction policy and prepare the local cities for what lies ahead. By focusing on the reduction emission strategies which save cities money, local governments can reduce their impact with devastating their budgets. Sharing best practices, policies, documents and activities reduces the strain on any one cities already overworked staff and elected officials. Whether it is benchmarking building energy use or focusing on emergency planning through adaptation strategies, cities can help one another with facilitation by a Climate Leaders branch in LA.


Generation Green's 4CL Program has formally established a network of over 700 leaders through our Constant Contact newsletter list and another 500 leaders on social media outlets such as Facebook in the Bay Area, specifically in Contra Costa County. Our network continues to grow on a regular basis. The network uses a multimedia communications strategy that ensures that best practices are shared and implemented throughout the local regional county network as climate action plans are continuing to develop. The communication strategy we have selected has a three pronged multimedia approach that provides encouraging reminders and easy access to the tools necessary to implement new policies. These prongs are:


o A regional website that acts as a repository for best practices polices with an interactive map and matrix of key issues


o A monthly newsletter full of pertinent and useful information including funding, legislative updates and upcoming events


o Periodic halfday workshops providing education and networking opportunities for key stakeholders on key climate issues


This multimedia approach ensures that best practices at the forefront of daytoday discussionand that they are shared, supported, and implemented into policies that reduce Greenhouse gas emissions in Contra Costa County. By supporting the leaders that are already present in LA County, we will not be stepping on the heels of other organizations or creating more work for staff, but we will be bringing together the many individuals and fostering the Climate Leaders that are already taking action!


","Directly from our efforts, six Contra Costa cities have completed Climate Action Plans. Four other Cities are currently in the process of developing a Climate Action Plan and eight additional city agreements have been made to accept assistance from local environmental organizations to being the Climate Action Planning Process by focusing on energyrelated emission reduction strategies. By viewing the interactive map on our website, http://www.cccclimateleaders.org/greencitiesmap.html, you can see the progress of our county. Significant environmental progress is underway but, there is still much to be done.





We have grown our newsletter network to over 700 people and have over 500 individuals on our social media outlets. 





We have completed a dozen indepth studies on environmental issues which have been used by several local cities.





We have held over a dozen workshops, connected with individuals from every city in Contra Costa County and have made real strides with the majority of the cities we work with.





",4CL will work with all of the local governments: both elected officials and staff members. We will also work with local nonprofit groups to mentor and create an active network in LA County. Any and all key stakeholders will be involved in order to spread the work and benefits of best practices.,"We use evaluation feedback surveys, track our website traffic, and monitor the activity and interactions with our newsletter.





We will continually maintain and expand our network in Contra Costa County and track our contacts. An uptodate contacts database tracks our efforts to target our message to the right people and prevent duplicating efforts.


We evaluate the use and effectiveness of our newsletter through the open rates and clicks on links through Constant Contact. We can see what draws the most attention and focus on the issues we see our network relating to most.


We rigorously track workshop attendees: both numbers of attendees as well as the cities represented. We post and share these lists of attendees on our website to ensure that the sustainability leaders are able to communicate with one another and continue the conversations that began during our workshops.


At the end of each workshop, we provide evaluation forms to ensure that attendees learn from our workshop topics, speakers, and receive enough information to help them. Through this process, each workshop is graded and feedback is reviewed on a scale of one to five in a number of categories, we have consistently receive scores averaging 4.5 or higher for our Contra Costa County Workshops.


We keep track of city progress through a local actions section on our website to see where each city is in environmental progress. Through a Climate Action Matrix and the Green Cities Map, we see where cities are in completing a climate action plan and on other important pieces of policy. This would most definitely be replicated for LA County.


We would also monitor the visitors and visitor activity on our website.


Our true measure of success and best feedback/evaluation is through the progress of the local governments we work with. The education, networking opportunities, and resources we provide are best evaluated by those who use our tools (or we find out why others do not use them). We continually seek feedback in order to ensure our resources are those that cities find helpful and give our cities the support they need! ","The heattrapping properties of global warming pollutants are undisputed. The fact that human activities generate these global warming pollutants is also undisputed. With more than 15 years of observed and studied scientific data, we now understand the climate system and its relationship to human activities. There is consensus among the IPCC and scientists about the reality of global warming. Although there may be uncertainty about exactly when, where and how the earthâ€™s climate will respond to global warming pollutants, there is no dispute, and observations indicate, that detectable warming changes are already under way.


Natural and human factors can both affect the average temperature of our planet. Natural variability in the Earthâ€™s climate system can cause small changes over decades to centuries. Industrialization has increased that rate, so that 80% of the current global carbon dioxide emissions result from human activities. In the 21st century, the global warming pollution that humans are causing will impact the climate tens or possibly a hundred times faster than natural rates


Climate change is a challenge too important to be denied and too urgent to be ignored. As cities, we depend on materials, products and people everywhere, and, as such, we need to work together to manage our world. In the absence of action by the federal government, US mayors are confronting climate change and working to improve the quality and livability of our cities. It isnâ€™t so much what you doâ€”just so long as you do it. LA County needs to be a part of taking action, and be a Climate Leader, share best practices and work with leaders to make changes to their greenhouse gas emissions. Our organization can be a facilitator of this change.


The overall longterm effect of change will be an improvement in lifestyles, quality of life and livable cities. The short term costs of purchasing biodiesel can be easily offset if we prevent increases in childhood asthma rates. Carpooling can cut down on commute time since it alleviates traffic congestion, pedestrian and bicycle friendly shopping areas generate a community center, and green power can provide fixed cost procurements.


We canâ€™t afford NOT to address climate change. The potential economic costs of impacts such as flooding, drought, loss of forest and tourism, are enormous. Companies are finding that reducing emissions can actually improve operational efficiencies, reduce energy and production costs, and increase market share.


","A 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from city operations would be a sure sign of success by 2050. This would take real work, real commitment, and a multitude of support from local governments, residents, constituents and key stakeholders."
3102103,2013103,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/dakathouse.html,daKAT House:  A Public Housing Project for musicians., Housing,"I am offering a scenario that impacts two of the eight suggested indicators; housing and arts/cultural vitality.





In 2013, many artists cannot afford to live in the â€œartist districtâ€, because the rent is so high.





Please follow me as I speak as if my idea is already a reality: 





In downtown Los Angeles, there is a 128unit building that is filled with musicians, and people who promote the music they generate.  22 floors of cats.  The building has a house jazz orchestra, a house symphonic orchestra, and daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra.  There are also dozens of offshoot groups.  Every month, they give a concert that costs five bucks to see.  Everyone who lives there teaches privately for ten bucks a lesson.





There is a concert hall, and a cafÃ© on the ground floor.  The sound of tenant recitals fill the air.  Every performance is recorded, filmed, and streamed around the world.





In exchange for $400.00/month rent, each musician provides a tenday/month commitment to rehearsal, performance, recitals, private lessons, and recording sessions.  In the course of a year, the people who live there generated four hundred CDs worth of recorded music.





House of daKAH cats.


daKAT House.





Like I said, this proposal follows the ""Twobird/Onestone"" theory of social policy.  As we get deeper into the 21st century, it's getting more important to find ways to cover a coupla bases with one paycheck.  We impact two indicators by providing affordable housing to a focused group of people who will enrich the musical landscape of the city.








PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT FOR MUSICIANS





The first step in my idea is to partner with an existing nonprofit housing organization, (or an individual who can create one), that can apply to HUD on our behalf.  As a fulltime musician, I am talking in vague terms about laws and regulations that I know nothing about. I am confident that someone with knowledge of this terrain will be able to navigate through the various housing programs that are available through the federal government that would support this approach to housing.





At first glance, an ArtistBased public housing project could exploit a combination of Section 8 tenant status, a Section 107 Community Development Block Grant, Section 3 Economic Opportunities, Section 221 Multifamily Rental Status and Section 213 Cooperative Housing programs.





The process of finding musicians to live in the building is a combination of an orchestra audition, applying for an O1 Artist Visa and an application for Section 8 housing.  We arenâ€™t looking for rich people who want to pay cheap rent.  We are looking for musicians, at any phase in their career, who need a break on the rent.





In addition to financial need, each tenant must demonstrate exceptional ability on their instrument.  Each tenant is also required to stay in L.A. during the term of their lease at daKAT House.  Short trips are negotiable, but the purpose is to build a house orchestra, of reliable cats.   


","I am applying as a composer with an idea about housing.  I have no achievements in the housing sector.  At this point, itâ€™s an achievement to make my rent payment on time.  





My achievements have all happened on a stage, in a classroom or in a recording studio.





As a composer/conductor, my friends and I started daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra in a nightclub in 1999.  We started it with no money.





By 2001, we had made it to Grand Performances.  In 2002, we made a CD, no record label.  In 2004, we were onstage at Disney Concert Hall, San Francisco and in Vegas.  In 2005, we were at Hollywood Bowl, South By Southwest, New Orleans during Jazzfest.





The movie â€œHIP HOP MAESTROâ€ was released in 2011.  The film traces this journey from the street to symphony hall.  





This is what makes me think we can pull it off.  All we had to work with was sheet music, and cats in chairs, learning how to play it.  After more than a decade, weâ€™ve built a deep community of musicians in L.A.





daKAT House operates with the same philosophy as daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, upping the stakes by providing a cheap roof over their heads.





As a musician, Iâ€™ve learned how to make something out of nothing.  The times Iâ€™ve been entrusted with resources have seen success more often than failure.  My strength is knowing my weakness, and finding the right people to execute the task.


","For wise counsel, I will be asking for guidance from a personal friend.  He has a lot more money than I do, and knows how to navigate the nonprofit sector with ease.





The most important person in this project is the nonprofit housing guru.  I have not identified this person yet. 





The most important collaborators will be the group of musicians living in the building.  


","A producer friend once said, â€œThe tape donâ€™t lie.â€





1Since our project has a performance and recording element, it will be as easy as looking at the iTunes playlist to see if we have been productive.





2After a year, I expect to see a rise in attendance at our concerts.  After spending some time teaching lessons, playing gigs on a consistent basis in a consistent venue, and being in the neighborhood, I would expect the people living nearby to start wandering in.





3Over time, I would expect to see a rise in the number of musicians living in L.A.  With L.A. getting press coverage as a city that supports its artists, word will most likely travel to other artists in other cities.





4On the macro level, I would expect to see a federal HUD program that treats artists housing the same way it treats tribal housing, and provides incentives to other cities to adopt these sorts of cultural reservations of real estate for artists.





5â€”I would hope to see an increase in interests towards instrumental music from young people.  I started playing in public school, because there was someone down the hall who could put a saxophone in my hands.  It was as simple as access.


","Fundamentally, it would provide affordable housing to a large group of people.  Even better, this large group of people happen to be outstanding musicians, who will dedicate the term of their leases to creating a musical ensemble with the other tenants.  And, even better than that, this group of musicians is engaged in the surrounding community, providing affordable instrumental music lessons to those who wish to learn.





Every month sees a performance of the house ensembles.  These performances are recorded, and broadcast over the internet.  A major factor in the promotion and exploitation of the recordings will be the fact that the musicians are living communally in subsidized housing provided through the city and federal government.





A program like this presents the city as a patron to its own artists.  This type of reputation can serve as a magnet for other artists to relocate to our city, contributing to the economy of L.A. 





Since the performances are affordable, the house ensembles present a way in which the workingclass community can discover symphonic music in a live environment. Since tickets to the L.A. Phil can get pricey, the opportunity to see live symphonic music is limited to those who have disposable income.  daKAT House provides this opportunity to those on a fixed budget.





This project provides a cadre of music teachers at a cutrate price to those who would like to learn.  The location of the Echo Park property is in close enough proximity to the VAPA Magnet High School in downtown L.A.  There are also several elementary and middle schools in the area that serve a workingclass community.  Discounted local music lessons could provide an option that may not have been available for some of these families.


","Every council district in the city of L.A. has at least one multiunit apartment complex reserved for musician residence.  Each of these buildings have their own house ensembles.  Each of the buildings has a unique flavor.  Building owners recruit musicians like star ballplayers.  The variety of the recordings speaks to the variety of people in L.A.  There is a baseline quality of musicianship around the city.





The State of California has provided an incentive to building owners to adopt their properties to cultural reservation use.  All buildings zoned for cultural reservation are taxexempt. 





Federal HUD programs now include a section called â€œCultural Reservation Housingâ€, where property owners are given tax breaks and reimbursements in exchange for providing cheap rent to artists.





The recordings generated by daKAT House went around the world, and musicians started moving to L.A. at an unusual rate.  Pretty soon, it was like Vienna 1790 on steroids.  The presence of so many musicians in one place created an environment of musical excellence.  You had to really be good to call yourself a musician in L.A. 2050.





After thirty years of daKAT House, there were over ten thousand CDs, and led several musical revolutions contained wherein.  The musicians at daKAT House became a legendary tribe, and were revered by musicians all over the globe.

3102104,2013104,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/globalgirlmedia.html,GLOBALGIRL MEDIA HIVE NETWORK, Education,"Los Angeles is one of the largest producers of media in the world in terms of television and films, and more recently, online/broadband media. The creation and consumption of this media is an integral aspect of growing up in Los Angeles. But with 45% of households in L.A. not earning enough to cover basic expenses, the chances that young people have to influence or participate in media is limited. Even with the explosion of new media formats and delivery platforms, marginalized L.A. youth, particularly young women, continue to be underrepresented both behind the camera and in front of it â€” creating a â€œdigital divide.â€ For a city so advanced and connected through film/media technologies, it is still shocking how it is one of the more disconnected cities in terms of integrating neighborhoods, cultural/arts groups, and young people, and how so much of the media industry continues to lock out the female voice.





GlobalGirl Media (GGM) develops the voice and media literacy of teenage girls in underserved communities in Los Angeles by teaching them to create and share digital journalism designed to ignite civic engagement and social change. Our model is unique in that it pairs girls in L.A. with girls in the developing world, creating a peertopeer international network of girls that communicate via new media, coproducing POVstyle journalism content that informs, engages and challenges its audience to action. GGM currently has projects in South Africa, Morocco, Chicago and Los Angeles, where it is headquartered.





While teenage girls are by far the most active demographic on social media, they are still more consumers rather than creators. Research has shown that  girlsâ€™ relationships, selfesteem and school performance are oftentimes negatively impacted by the more time they spend online, (Girl Scout Research Institute, 2011). GGM believes young women need to be creating their own media rather than consuming it.  We envision a worldwide movement where young women are learning to challenge, innovate and reshape their worlds through digital media. With the explosive growth of â€œedutechâ€ and digital learning programs across the nation, GGM sees itself as a collaborative, innovative and leading partner in this movement, by promoting diverse, crosscultural viewpoints from a demographic rarely heard from in this arena: the young female voice. 





Founded in 2010, GGM was inspired by other youth media and digital literacy projects in Los Angeles, where communitybased journalism, storytelling and filmmaking workshops are reshaping young peopleâ€™s lives (LA Freewaves, Urban Media Foundation,


Intersections South LA, Boyle Heights Beat, Venice Arts, HOLA, Echo Park Film School, etc.) We are proposing a GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE NETWORK, working together with these likeminded organizations to amplify the civic voices, aspirations and digital networks of girls to realize a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for Los Angeles. 





We are seeking funding to develop this hive, to be hosted at the Robert F. Kennedy Digital Media Learning Lab, inviting girls from all our networked programs to participate in a weekly afterschool digital media lab throughout the school year, with a 4week intensive kickoff course in the summer of 2013. Our program will train an initial 60 teenage girls in digital literacy, solutionsbased journalism, HD video production, web 2.0 basics, cell phone filming/texting and onair media training. The girls will work in production teams and select their own subject matter, which will focus on issues of particular relevance to their lives, such as violence against women; sexuality, reproductive rights, education and careers, food and obesity, bullying and cyber relationships, education, arts, sports, music and culture.  Visiting lectures by leading women professionals in media are incorporated into the curriculum, and the training also includes field trips to local newspapers, radio and television stations, maker/hacker spaces, youtube studios, etc.  Our impact is as global as the reach of the internet and cellphone technology.  More than just giving girls the skills they need to create original mediawe make sure itâ€™s seen. Our interactive website is a place where girls can safely upload and watch their videos, post blogs, play games, add comments, and interact with young mediamakers throughout the world. 





After the summer training, The GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE will become a safe haven/hangout for girls all across Los Angeles who can drop in, create media, share stories and otherwise network with each other throughout the school year. Although there are a finite number of girls being trained each year (60) as GlobalGirl Reporters, the hive hangout will be open to any girl in Los Angeles.  Literally a HIVE of activity, girls will be producing local news programs, films, games, phone apps and media content that improves the overall quality of young womensâ€™ lives in Los Angeles.


","As of June 2012, GGM has implemented initiatives in seven cities in South Africa, Morocco, Chicago and L.A.,  training more than 120 young women, who have produced 150 video features using traditional camera and sound; 85 mobile journalism pieces on Ipod touch devices; and 200 blog reports that were distributed through transmedia platforms, predominantly online, but also including print, broadcast TV and cable, cell phones, radio and social media. We have built a significant social media following, with 5,000 visitors per month to our website, 4,800 Twitter followers and 3,500 Facebook members (across four regional groups).





Our work has been supported by the Nike Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, Soros Foundation, World Bank, Durfee Foundation, McCormick Foundation, Latino Public Broadcasting, Abigail Disney, Eileen Fisher Foundation, and our work has been featured on PBS, ESPN, ABC, NBC, Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post, GritTV, Democracy NOW, KCET, KCRW, Participantâ€™s Take Part.org, The Standard (South Africa), Hess Press (Morocco), etc.





In Los Angeles, we have trained a total of 30 young women, with 10 still actively working as GlobalGirl â€œcitizen journalists.â€  We just launched our first webisode series, sponsored by Latino Public Broadcasting and the NEA, featured on www.worldchannel.org (PBS global site). Titled COMO AMAR (â€œHow to Love,â€)

","While many digital news training programs and sites produce great content, they stop short of really activating their audience, finding out how that content influences and shapes lives.  We at GGM are especially interested in how our training and the girlsâ€™ stories impact themselves and their communities.  





GlobalGirl Media tracks its success and achievements through many indicators, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We assess our GlobalGirl participants before, during and posttraining, and we followup with questionaires and facetoface interviews through our mentorship program.  In addition, we collect and analyze data from our website and social media sites, through popular engagement metrics such as Chartbeat, Facebook Insights, GetClicky, etc. 





However, we also acknowledge the pitfalls of evaluating this population and we are looking beyond the number of hits a video or website gets to really assessing the impact on our participants, their families and peers. We will be working with Kimberley Silver, the Director of Mission Measurement, LLC a strategy consulting firm that helps clients to create value through social change. They will help us track elusive and intangible outcomes such as college readiness, financial stability, policy change and public awareness.  We can then create new data through smart proxies and develop reliable insights that inform strategic decisions that will better help us communicate persuasively with our audience and future donors.





Because this will be the first time we work with such a large network of other organizations, we will collaborate on a robust evaluation program with best practices developed by these other organizations.  We are keen to include more longterm evaluations of all our participants, tracking such measurables as girlsâ€™ grades, motivation, family relationships, etc. before and after their participation in all our programs.  We also are dedicated to assessing how our videos and blogs are changing/shaping our youth viewers, and are presently designing an indepth evaluation that will provide a better picture of how our audience goes from users to investors, in terms of both social capitols and/or as content contributors, volunteers, commentators, donors, or subscribers.


","Anyone who lives in Los Angeles is aware of the glaring disparities between wealth, education and access, and how these schisms play out in the media. Girls in our target communities are grappling with a 45% high school dropout rate, gang and drug violence, high rates of teen pregnancy, and the overall challenges of growing up with limited resources. It doesn't help when they are also bombarded with highly sensationalistic reporting and negative stereotypes in film, television and music videos, rather than providing positive images and rolemodels.





Being able to tell oneâ€™s own story and believe in oneâ€™s own voice is the beginning of being able to advocate for all forms of social justice. GGM believes its model of interactive, peerbased media training through which young women seek to exert both voice and influence on issues of public concern can lead to real systemic change.  Our training provides a fun, connected, and personalized education experience that  recognizes girlsâ€™ strengths in technology and media, areas where they donâ€™t necessarily gravitate. This in turn helps them stay focused, stay in school, develop and demonstrate skills and abilities for jobs and economic development.





The potential of increasing access for women and girls to new media technology is exponential. Once one young woman experiences the transformative benefits of the program, she often becomes a â€œtransmitterâ€ introducing others in her community to her ideas and work, creating a ripple effect of change. Girls who are feeling disconnected can start to feel â€œconnectedâ€ throughout our hive network, seeking out mentors, apprenticeships and other GlobalGirls from across L.A. and other countries.





What we are really doing is advocating for a girldriven global â€œdigital citizenship,â€ where girls harness social media for social change, sharing and transferring their new knowledge with other girls who interact internationally on our website, games, apps and blogs, who in turn build on that knowledge and remix it for their own needs, then pay it forward by sharing/resharing that knowledge.





In contrast to our target areaâ€™s dropout rate, GGM graduates have a 100% high school enrollment/graduation rate and a 90% college enrollment rate. Further, 69% have continued to report for the L.A. bureau beyond their initial training. Girls who have taken our training talk about the power of connectivity, authorship and how making their own media gives them confidence to build brighter futures.





In a recent Ted Talk, GlobalGirl Rocio Ortega said this: â€œGlobalGirl Media taught me for the first time the value of my own voice, I worked with Tebogo form South Africa, and although we have similar dreams and ambitions, we learn from our different experiencesâ€¦I thought I was alone in my struggle with my father and my culture. My opportunity with GGM has helped me to speak my mind and express my ideas weâ€™ve not only become global sisters, but advocates for change in our communityâ€¦â€


","Success will be thriving, connected, innovative and safe digital learning space for young women in Los Angeles.  Most critical to our success, more girls from lowincome communities in Los Angeles will be more likely to stay in school, stay connected and excited about learning, and have a more global view of the world. 





Our GLOBALGIRLS HIVE NETWORK will launch hundreds of confident, empowered and opinionated young women into the job market of Los Angeles, building new digital startups, leading the way in innovative media and digital educaton initiatives that will put L.A. on the map as a city where women, and particularly African American and Latina women in new media technologies are breaking new ground. Yes, L.A. presently ranks third in the nation in terms of entrepreneurship and digital startups, but this growing ""silicon beach"" spirit must include more women, half the population of Los Angeles (!),  if it is to truly transform our city. 





Our success will also mean that girls will be contributing to the larger L.A. media landscape, improving access for women to professional careers in print and broadcast journalism, film and television production, new media, gaming, etc. In 2050, we see gender parity in all areas of media, due to the work of GlobalGirl Media: more female news editors and news directors, more female film/TV directors, cinematographers, producers, writers. More media that doesnâ€™t dumb down, sexualize or otherwise stereotype women and girls. 





Research by Stacy Smith at the Geena Davis' Institute on Gender and Media finds a causal relationship between female content creators and positive female portrayals in media. GGM imagines a world where young girls engage in these positive images, breaking personal boundaries and ultimately beginning to shift cultural and societal gender perceptions, having a monumental impact on the entertainment industry.





Encouraged by the explosive growth in broadband TV and broadband producers (100% growth in the last 12 months to become a 6 billion dollar industry) our success will also be to expand from our current model to create a fullservice broadband distribution channel â€“ a â€œthinking girls global YouTubeâ€  that not only features work produced by GlobalGIrl Media reporters, but also includes news stories about issues pertinent to young women the world over. This GlobalGirl broadband channel will investigate what it means to be a girl today, streaming online news content by, for and about girls, and will become the â€œgotoâ€ place for girls around the world, as well as researchers, reporters and teachers that will use the content for their specific needs.

3102105,2013105,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/goglayc.html,Grades of Green  Los Angeles Youth Corps, Environmental Quality,"THE IDEA</p>


<p>Grades of Green, a California based nonprofit dedicated to making environmental protection second nature in young minds, proposes to use the LA2050 grant monies to create a Los Angeles Chapter of its Youth Corps (â€œLAYCâ€). </p>





<p>An offshoot of Grades of Greenâ€™s existing Youth Advisory Board, the LAYC will be Los Angeles based and projectoriented.  The LAYC will be made up of teams of three to six students at 10 Los Angeles schools who will work together to implement a Green Project at their school or in their local community in the summer and fall of 2013.  The teams can choose to implement one of Grades of Greenâ€™s highimpact environmental activities detailed on our website, such as â€œTrash Free Tuesdaysâ€ or â€œWalk to School Wednesdays,â€ or an environmental project of their own creation. </p>





<p>THE DETAILS</p>


<p>Using Grades of Greenâ€™s extensive school network (169 schools worldwide and growing), our partnerships with Los Angeles area schools, as well as our many media contacts, we will advertise the LAYC beginning this spring and pick 10 school teams to serve on the LAYC.  We will make every effort to have at least five of the 10 schools come from underserved areas.</p>





<p>Once the 10 teams are in place, Grades of Green staff will work with the teams to perform environmental assessments at their schools to identify a Green Project that would best suit their schoolsâ€™ needs.  Once the Green Projects have been chosen and signed off on by the school administration, the students will work with Grades of Green to develop an implementation plan.  Each team will receive a portion of the grant money to execute its Green Project.  Over the summer, Grades of Green will hold an LAYC Orientation Day for the teams to come together, share their ideas and receive training from Grades of Green staff.</p>





<p>Once school starts in the fall, Grades of Green staff will work with the teams to hold a kickoff day at each school and then to roll out their Green Projects.  The 10 LAYC teams will have until December 1, 2013 to complete their projects.  Once the projects are complete, Grades of Green will hold an LAYC Celebration Night where the teams will share the results of their Green Projects with one another, Grades of Green staff and board members and representatives from LA2050 and the Goldhirsh Foundation.  Grades of Green will seek press coverage of the event, as well as of the LAYC, their Green Projects and successes.</p>





<p>THE IMPACT</p>


<p>As detailed in the LA2050 Report, Los Angelesâ€™ Environmental Quality, while improving, still has a long way to go.  At Grades of Green, we believe the best way to ensure future environmental sustainability is to make environmental protection second nature in our children.  It is our children who will continue the work cleaning up Los Angelesâ€™ air, expanding upon current water conservation efforts and recognizing the importance of providing safe, clean, green outdoor space to all Angelenos.  Put simply, it is our children who will get us where we need to be in 2050.</p>





<p>But where can kids learn and become inspired about the importance of protecting the environment? Unfortunately, environmental education is not part of our public schoolsâ€™ curriculum.  This is where Grades of Green comes in.  Identifying the need and desire for environmental education and action in schools, yet recognizing the reality of shrinking budgets and limited resources, Grades of Green was founded to bring fun, handson environmental education programs into the classroom at no or low cost to schools.  Over the last three years, we have brought muchneeded environmental education to 169 schools worldwide.</p>





<p>The impact of the LAYC will extend far beyond the benefits each Green Project will bring to the schools and their communities.  The participating students will learn firsthand the power of their own actions to make a difference, which will create a ripple effect, inspiring other students, parents, educators, community and business leaders within their greater school communities.</p>





<p>While we anticipate the greatest impact of this program to be on Los Angelesâ€™ longterm Environmental Quality, we also expect impacts across the Education and Social Connectedness Indicators.  On the education front, our website provides schools access to over 40 free tools and activities to raise environmental awareness and protect their local environment.  Schools have found our environmental education resources a great supplement to their curricula, including programs aligned with Californiaâ€™s Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) standards.  In terms of Social Connectedness, the LAYC will bring kids and communities together from across the city and socioeconomic boundaries to share their ideas and experiences.  The LAYC will also provide valuable handson lessons to the participants and their school communities about the importance of volunteerism and civic engagement.","<p>EXPANSION & RECOGNITION</p>


<p>Since our website launched just three years ago on Earth Day 2010, Grades of Green has grown rapidly and expanded internationally with more than 104,000 students in 27 states and four countries enrolled in our programs.  Grades of Green has been honored with several awards over the last four years, including the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s prestigious Environmental Award, a United States Conference of Mayors Award, as well as being instrumental in two Grades of Green schools being designated as â€œGreen Ribbon Schoolsâ€ by the U.S. Department of Education. </p>





<p>PROGRAM WORK</p>


<p>Through our program work, we have brought and are bringing real environmental change to our communities.  Some examples include:  helping more than 50 Los Angeles County schools divert over 50,000 bags of trash from local landfills through our Trash Free Lunch Program; helping several California schools districts stop the use of toxic cleaning supplies in their schools; performing a â€œgreeningâ€ of 10 underserved schools in the Los Angeles area and helping them set up waste reduction programs, including inclass recycling and lunchtime sorting systems; and assisting several local schools end the use of Styrofoam trays at lunch time.  Should we receive one of the LA2050 grants, we look forward to continuing this handson program work in the schools within the LAYC. </p>





<p>EMPOWERING OUR YOUTH</p>


<p>While we are proud of the recognition our organization has received and the projects we have led, we believe our most important work is teaching our children that they have the power to make a difference.  As noted above, it was Grades of Green students who went to their City Councils in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach to ask for bans of plastic bags and Styrofoam.  Inspired by those stories, El Segundo High School students recently went to their City Council to ask that additional recycling containers be placed around town. </p> 





<p>Several of our existing Youth Corps students have received national and regional recognition for their environmental efforts, including Grace C and Sam H who were named as Champions for Change by the White House, and Max R and Reese R, who were featured in a Washington Post article about banning Styrofoam. </p>





<p>Other Youth Corps and Grades of Green students are tackling environmental problems big and small at their schools and in their communities.  For example, Yaeeun H is using Grades of Green 3R curriculum to teach kids at her school about how and why to protect the environment; Sydney H, a sixth grader, is organizing an ewaste collection drive at her school; Sam H is collecting used shoes to donate to Soles for Souls; and Lauren S and Jenna R, both sixth graders, are working to plant a native garden at their school.  These kids are the future of Los Angeles and our best hope of making our vision for Los Angeles a reality in 2050. </p>


","<p>At Grades of Green we are fortunate to have many partners and collaborators, including local ewaste collection agencies and area waste haulers who help our schools implement recycling, composting and other trash reduction efforts.  We also have relationships with a number of governmental agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, as well as with many environmental nonprofits, including Heal the Bay, Healthy Child Healthy World, the Coalition for Clean Air and 5 Gyres to name a few.  Once the LAYC teams have decided upon their projects, we will reach out to these partners as appropriate to ask for their help and/or support.  </p>","<p>Measuring outcomes is one of Grades of Greenâ€™s strengths.  It is our standard operating procedure to prepare final reports for all of our grants.  Moreover, we also prepare impact reports for each of the schools in which we perform our programs. </p>





<p>Additionally, many of the programs on our website are metric based; that is, we encourage the students to collect data prior to implementing the program and then take those same measurements once the project is complete.  For example, with our Trash Free Lunch Program, we work with the schools to measure the amount of trash produced on a daily basis at their school as well as the number of weekly waste hauler pick ups before program implementation.  Once the sorting and trash reduction systems are in place, the students collect that data again and can see firsthand what a huge difference their project is making, both in terms of savings to their school and amount of trash diverted from local landfills. </p>





<p>The LAYC Green Projects will be evaluated on similar metric systems.  As part of the initial eco assessment at each school, we will help the student teams gather their starting or â€œbaselineâ€ numbers.  We will then work with them at the end of their Green Projects to gather the end data and compile their numbers.  Part of their final presentations at the Celebration Night will be sharing their numeric results.  We have found that gathering and analyzing this kind of data has been one of the most powerful lessons for the kids, as they see in a very concrete way the power of their individual and collective actions. </p>


","<p>Grades of Greenâ€™s LAYC will benefit Los Angeles in several important ways. </p> 





<p>First and foremost, each participating school and school community will receive direct environmental benefit from that schoolâ€™s Green Project, be it a Walk to School Wednesday or TrashFree Tuesday Lunch Campaign, an eWaste Collection, a CampusWide Detox, a Compost System Implementation, a clean up of a local park or beach or whatever Green Project the team chooses to implement.  Results of the Green Projects will range from fewer carbon emissions, less trash sent to local landfills, proper disposal of electronic materials, the elimination of toxic chemicals on campus and so on. </p>





<p>Additionally, each of the 10 participating schools will become a â€œGrades of Green Schoolâ€ with access to over 40 free, fun and handson environmental education tools and activities they can continue to implement on campus for the years to come.  The schools can build on their experience and success and take on additional green activities as they are ready.  Statistics indicate, and our experience confirms, that when schools implement programs like the ones we have detailed on our website, the schools typically save money, test scores go up and students learn valuable lessons about the power their individual actions can have in helping to protect the environment. </p>





<p>Moreover, we have found that by educating and inspiring our kids to care for and protect the environment, we are raising environmental awareness in our communities through a â€œtrickle upâ€ approach.  That is, when students learn, for example, about the â€œ4Rsâ€ â€“ reduce, reuse, recycle and rot (composting) â€“ they often go home and ask their parents to help them pack trash free lunches or set up recycle and/or composting systems at home.  Students also take these ideas to their teachers and administrators and ask for their help making their schools cleaner and greener.  We have even seen students empowered by our education programs petition their local governments for environmental measures.  In Manhattan Beach, for example, Grades of Green kids were the impetus behind the City banning the use of plastic bags.  Hermosa Beach students were credited with convincing their City Council to ban the use of Styrofoam containers in local restaurants.  The LAYC will inspire and empower students to care for and protect the environment; those students, in turn, will inspire and empower their broader school community, including their parents, educators, community leaders and businesspeople to care for and protect the environment.  This ripple effect will benefit the entire city of Los Angeles. </p>





<p>Finally, and most importantly, we are shaping the minds and habits of Los Angelesâ€™ next generation of leaders, teachers, voters, executives and parents â€“ the people who can make a difference in what Los Angeles looks like in 2050. </p>


","<p>Grades of Green envisions a Los Angeles in 2050 in which environmental protection is second nature in the minds of our leaders, our populace and our childrenâ€™s children. </p>





<p>The habits and knowledge gained from the work of the LAYC will serve as valuable lessons to teach kids to make better choices and appreciate the Earthâ€™s natural resources throughout their lives.  The LAYC students will have developed a sense of confidence and empowerment having been motivated by learning and discovery.  They, in turn, will have passed these lessons on to their peers, communities and their own children. </p>





<p>Along with the efforts of other environmental organizations, the result will be a sustainable Los Angeles.  Our schools will be free of chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers; our air will be cleaner as a result of using alternative energy, reducing energy consumption and kids walking, wheeling or carpooling to school; Angelenos will have reduced the amount of trash they generate by 80% through recycling and composting, as well as the amount of water used by 80% through continued conservation efforts.   In sum, future generations will have a better opportunity to live in an environment with clean air, clean water and a clean Earth! </p>

3102106,2013106,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CleanBeachesandOcean.html,Think Before You Trash, Environmental Quality,"Grain of Sand  Granito de Arena (in Spanish) is a nonprofit organization run by Ernesto Renella, (local business leader, surfer and community volunteer) to teach environmental awareness and stewardship to underprivileged children in local communities. The mission is to build a healthier environment and educate children to create a better world. The program teaches children that their daily decisions affect the beaches and marine environment around the world and shows them how to connect to nature through environmental awareness and surfing.





â€œBeing in the ocean is a much more personal experience than just looking at it from the beach or highway. Surfing is about being physically and mentally moved by the power of the ocean. By experiencing its energy   directly affecting its own element and environment. Once these kids stand up the first time and ride a wave in, they never look at the water the same way again. The ocean transforms into something that they need to respect, maintain and protect so that future generations can enjoy it as much as they do. The way I see it, each person represents a grain of sand, standing alone one might seem small and insignificant, but working together with our neighbors we are powerful and can create a better future for everyone.â€","Teach surfing camps â€“ surfing competitions

LA unified school district ","It may be difficult to â€œmeasureâ€ the success of my endeavor, because it is hard to evaluate the lasting impact that experience, education, awareness has on children. One thing I know for certain is that bringing a child, who has never been to the beach, to experience the sand and the ocean is something that is life changing. This action alone has a lasting and unmeasurable impact. Every child who comes through the program learns not just about how to take care of the beach and the oceans, but also how small daily efforts can impact the environment in a large and positive way. Armed with such knowledge, the students in turn learn about the responsibility of teaching others how to respect and take care of nature too. And lastly, when children learn about water safety and how to surf, they challenge themselves and embrace a healthier lifestyle.","Grain of Sand  Granito de Arena brings innercity children to the beach, and pairs them with local surfers and environmental speakers for a day of learning, surfing and beach clean ups. Through fun and mentorship, young people understand that the beach is just as much theirs as everyone elseâ€™s and it's up to them to take care of it. The children develop an understanding of: the negative effects of water and land pollution, the impact that individuals and communities have on the ocean, the profound effects of recycling programs and the importance of wiser buying choices.  Furthermore, exercising in nature through surfing encourages children to become more active and healthier. ","in light of public opposition over the The Clean Water, Clean Beaches ballot measure, that would pay to reduce storm water pollution, Los Angeles County supervisors may axe the proposed clean water fee. As it stands, the Clean Water, Clean Beaches measure would increase L.A. County residentâ€™s property tax bills by about $54 for the typical homeowner and possibly thousands of dollars for some commercial property owners. The County spends an outrageous amount annually In grooming and cleaning our beaches on a daily basis. This fee could be rendered unnecessary altogether if everyone did their part in properly recycling trash and helping to keep storm drains free of debris.





By educating enough people to make environmental friendly consumer purchases, responsible trash disposal and to be aware that all storm drains end up in the ocean, citizens have the power to not only make a positive environmental impact, but also a fiscal impact as well. Instead of spending financial resources reacting to current problems, we can instead create a cleaner and greener future.

3102107,2013107,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FandangObon2050.html,Fandango Obon Project / Proyecto Fandango Obon,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Overview:


Los Angeles is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, but crosscultural interaction is often hindered by injustice, misconceptions, fear and competition for resources.  Can a musical dialogue open cultural borders between diverse Angeleno communities?  Can ritual circle dance help us imagine a new vision for Los Angeles? 


The LA2050 study indicates that Arts and Cultural Vitality significantly enhance the quality of life in Los Angeles.  GREAT LEAP is creating the FandangoObon Project as a fresh way to boost this potential.  


This collaboration between the Grammywinning artists of QUETZAL, and Nobuko Miyamoto will cocreate an original composition that brings together two thriving Latin and Asian music and dance traditions â€“ Fandango son Jarocho and Obon.  A series of crosscultural workshops throughout Los Angeles will teach the song and communal dance, and guide a creative process to share traditions and personal stories to deepen understanding between participants. On November 2nd, Day of the Dead, a culminating FandangoObon celebration will bring together diverse community members, musicians and dancers in a ritual piece at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center Plaza. A documentary short video will be created from the process and spread through social media to engage the widest audience. We hope to secure a broadcast television outlet for the video as well.  Our goal with this project is to inspire other communities to replicate this model, with meaningful, indepth cultural exchanges that we believe will create a more harmonious, sustainable Los Angeles of the future.  


A Dialogue Between Cultures:


Fandango Son Jarocho is a popular folk form of music and dance rooted in Indigenous, African, and Spanish cultures from Veracruz, Mexico.  Musicians playing â€˜jaranasâ€™ (small 8string guitars) in a circle, others singing and dancing percussively upon the wooden platform, generate a spirit of â€œconvivenciaâ€  living/being together, building communication and trust. Quetzal Flores and Martha Gonzalez of â€œQuetzalâ€ brought what they learned from Veracruz and are strengthening a network of Fandango Groups spreading throughout L. A. and the nation.   


Obon is an ancient folk music and dance from the Japanese Buddhist tradition, brought here over 100 years ago.  The music commonly uses shamisen, a stringed instrument, taiko and voices also performed on a raised platform.  Japanese communities dance the circle at summertime Obon festivals to remember their ancestors.  Nobuko has been instrumental in translating this traditional form into a vibrant contemporary practice by creating new songs in English.  Over 10,000 people danced her popular environmentalthemed piece, â€œMottainai (Donâ€™t Waste Nature)â€ at 16 temples during 201112.  This new collaboration between Nobuko and Quetzal will spark a groundbreaking â€œmusical dialogueâ€ between cultures.  The new piece themed, â€œAll Things Connected,â€ will give space to each form to express its traditional uniqueness, while exploring new improvisational and harmonic possibilities. Choreography from both traditions will be taught by seasoned dancers, however will be fundamental and familiar enough that people of all ages and abilities can learn, enjoy and interpret freely.  


The Community Workshops:


Fandango Son Jarocho and Obon are proven models for community building.  In the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Little Tokyo and South L.A., Great Leap will offer a series of workshops to teach the music and dance in community centers, temples, and schools to gather participants for the culminating performance/celebration.  Handson experience with instruments like the Jarana and taiko, and improvisational exchanges with musicians will bridge the publicâ€™s connection to these folk forms. Most importantly, we will provide a space and process for sharing personal stories and cultural traditions that will deepen knowledge of each other.  


The Performance/Celebration:


The finale premieres the new Quetzal/Nobuko piece that will engage at least 500 people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds at the plaza of the JACCC.  In a ritual of connectedness there will be performances of Son Jarocho, Obon and Taiko communities, and stories about their cultural significance.


Documentation and Replication:


Videomaking and distribution through social media will extend our journey of creative exchange and engage the general public.  Our documentary will dramatize how participants reflect on and are changed by their experiences, and how the knowledge of our interdisciplinary practices can be continued by a new group of artist leaders. As L. A. lags behind comparable metropolitan cities in per capita expenditures on arts and culture, a project like FandangoObon, developed at the grassroots and made inclusive and accessible to underserved communities, is vitally important.  Our hope is to inspire many bold, innovative crosscultural collaborations L.A.â€™s future.


","2013 is the 35th anniversary of Great Leap.  We have consistently created productions, workshops and art programs that have grown from our engagement with diverse communities. Our longevity reflects our ability to change, innovate and respond to the needs of the times.  





In 1978, Founder/Artistic Director, Nobuko Miyamoto established Great Leap as a nonprofit arts organization creating concerts and musical theater works reflecting the Asian American experience, successfully mounting and touring musicals â€œChop Sueyâ€ and â€œTalk Storyâ€ on the West Coast and Hawaii. 





In response to the racial conflicts of Los Angeles Uprising in 1992, Great Leap became a multicultural arts organization, presenting the firstvoice stories of Asian, Latino and African American artists in â€œA Slice of Rice, Frijoles and Greens.â€  To this day the performance tours colleges including a yearly show at UCLAâ€™s Medical School as cultural awareness training for new interns.  Our youth version toured schools for 10 years, reaching 50,000 youth yearly with the Music Center on Tour program.





In 2001, the events of 9/11 pushed us to create workshops and that brought together people from the Muslim, Buddhist, Christian and Jewish communities.  We created a sacred space where people could share their stories and traditions, and experienced the power of the bonding that resulted.  From this we developed the theater piece â€œLeaps of Faith,â€ performed at the 2009 World Parliament of Religions in Australia.  





Great Leap has also designed Arts and Yoga for Youth, a program for USCâ€™s Upward Bound program, training and creating performances with young people.  In 2005 we created our artist mentorship program, Collaboratory to pass on our creative practices to the next generation.  We are now doing the tenth cycle of Collaboratory in Long Beach, with Cambodian, Samoan and Tongan artists and community members who will learn Great Leapâ€™s creative and collaborative methodology in theater making and community building.  





Now we are using our environmental music video series, â€œEcoVidsâ€ as an innovative way to engage communities of color with the critical issue of Climate Change and highlight the sustainable practices passed down the generations.  The first, â€œB.Y.O. Chopstix,â€ promotes conservation by using disposable chopsticks; â€œMottainaiâ€ tells the story of the Japanese tradition of â€œNo Waste,â€ and â€œCycles of Change,â€ a collaboration between Quetzal and Nobuko, encourages urban families to bicycle for their health and the environment.   Since 2010 the Ecovids have received over 45,000 views on YouTube.

They will have transformative experiences and a sense of pride and ownership in the culminating performance and video.  This is a rare opportunity for these two communities to experience a deeper understanding of their significance within â€œthe American story.â€


We expect our program to effect the following changes:


 Authentic, thoughtprovoking works of performing art will be created and preserved

 Participants and audiences gain a deeper understanding of the power of culture to build community


 Increased interaction and communication between two diverse communities in Los Angeles

 Our goal for the documentary short is to generate 10,000 YouTube hits per year.   We hope to increase this number exponentially by securing television broadcasts time.


","While our neighborhoods in many ways provide comfortable, safe havens, and especially for immigrant populations, there should exist friendly avenues to enter and exit, and meaningful opportunities to engage across them.  Great Leap continues its commitment to use the arts to bridge cultural boundaries.  Over our 35 years we have developed methodologies to provide people of diverse ethnicities, religions and other selfidentifications with opportunities for deep and meaningful encounters.





Important elements of FandangoObon are providing a compelling purpose for people to come together, and the creation of an affirming space for exploration and expression without judgment.  It is an entrance to a place in time where music, dance, and connection with oneâ€™s ancestral traditions can be lived with pride.  Our theater techniques, games and other facilitation frameworks help participants bond with people of other backgrounds, often for the first time.  Once such a â€œbarrierâ€ is unlocked, it can be more easily be opened in future encounters across the city.  We practice assertive outreach to ensure that our gatherings are not only crosscultural, but also intergenerational, so that young people can learn from elders who may have deeper understanding from direct experience with their cultural heritage.





Geographical dimensions of L. A. will be utilized in unique ways. The L.A. River separates Boyle Heights and Little Tokyo. Though only a short walk across a bridge, residents of the respective neighborhoods generally do not interact, other than in passing. FandangoObon will give impetus to cross the â€œbridgeâ€ â€“ on foot, bicycle or via the metro.  A workshop at the Nishi Hongwanji Temple just west of the 1st St. Bridge, will welcome a mainly Latino community into a Japanese American setting. Conversely, residents of Little Tokyo will travel the short distance to Boyle Heights to be welcomed by our workshop partner Building Healthy Communities.





Additional crosscultural engagements include a workshop at A Place Called Home (APCH) in South Los Angeles, bringing Japanese Americans to a center with mainly African American and Latino youth.  APCH is located only 3 miles south of Little Tokyo down Central Avenue, an historic cultural Mecca of its own. 





FandangoObon will elevate awareness of Angelenosâ€™ common histories within geographic proximity.  For example, how many of us knew that Boyle Heights has had established Japanese and Jewish communities in the recent past?  Mutual understanding can lower cultural barriers and help us â€œcreate a circle danceâ€ that respects our uniqueness while building trust and stronger community relations.  We see the potential for this project to change stereotypical perceptions that separate us.  As our city and nation continues moving toward people of color being the majority, we want L.A. to stand out as a place where arts and culture are robust and accessible to all and are used in innovative ways to meet our challenges.


","One measure of success would be that the â€œArts and Cultural Vitality indicatorâ€ would remain at its present level of significantly enhancing human development in Los Angeles  made possible through continued and increased philanthropic and government support to match the resourceful ways art continues to be empowered in grassroots communities, whether funds are available or not.   





However Los Angelesâ€™ communities of color and other underserved communities have had a long history of dedicated creative artists leaving their footprints the 1960â€™s and before.  Regardless of funding, we have found ways to voice our stories and build a sense of connection.  If our cultural indicator decreases because of lack of public funding, we will not be leaving for greener pastures.  We are here less for the art jobs, and more to express, reflect and create a sustainable way of life for our communities, one person at a time.  Some of our elders from the generation of artists that emerged from the Civil Rights struggles are passing on, but not without leaving their creative knowledge with younger generations.  Smaller community arts organizations are looking at new ways of sharing resources and partnering. Great Leap has begun to do art workshops with environmental organizations to help voice concerns about the environment, which will become a larger concern as we move into the future. 





In the year 2050 we envision that artists and arts organizations will continue to give and receive vitality, finding new ways to flourish and be relevant for our communities and Great Leap remains committed to this journey.

3102108,2013108,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BikeShopLocal.html,Whatâ€™s the BF(B)D? Connecting Neighborhoods through BicycleFriendly Business Districts, Social Connectedness,"&nbsp;</p>Green Octopus Consulting will partner with local business associations, the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition (LACBC), and LA Streetsblog to create five bicyclefriendly business districts in Los Angeles. A bicyclefriendly business district is where a community comes together around bicycles to bike to area shops and restaurants â€“ and where merchants and employees ride, too. Itâ€™s the integration of bicycling into a business districtâ€™s operations, events, and promotions. 


&nbsp;</p>


Bicyclefriendly business districts improve local economies by strengthening connections between residents and their local businesses, increasing small business revenues, and improving neighborhood vitality and connectedness, all the while improving public safety, environmental health, and GLH â€“ Gross Local Happiness. 


&nbsp;</p>


The â€˜alienationâ€™ that has historically defined the LA urban landscape â€“ largely due to fastmoving cars that move through a place but donâ€™t stop and connect with it â€“ is starting to change. Bicyclefriendly neighborhoods are one of the strongest trends to emerge around the U.S. as a way to improve social connectedness in our communities. Getting people out of their cars and onto bikes as a mode of transport â€“ particularly on the weekends for neighborhood shopping, dining and errands â€“ is creating lasting, meaningful change for individuals, neighborhoods, and our local economies.


&nbsp;</p>


At the heart of this idea is to facilitate connections between business owners, local residents, and advocates. These stakeholders will work together to integrate bicycling into the neighborhoodsâ€™ existing events, online and print promotions, and business association operations. Weâ€™ll:


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Produce a bike map and destination guide for each district


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Host community rides through the districts


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Incorporate bicycling into each districtâ€™s events through bike valets, free basic bike repair, bike portraits, and more


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Outfit the districts with bikes for errands and deliveries


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Produce two LA Streetsblog videos introducing people to the program and shopping by bike


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Create a snazzy program website with everything you'd want to know about the program


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Establish lasting relationships between business districts and their local bike shops and the LACBC


&nbsp;</p>


Through interactive workshops, each district will decide what else theyâ€™d like to incorporate into their neighborhood. Business districts will benefit from free publicity as their efforts are recognized in the bicycling community and general media.


&nbsp;</p>


Bicycling goes handinhand with placemaking â€“ creating a â€˜sense of placeâ€™ for a neighborhood. Increased bicycling in a business district results in more women and children coming to that area, increased small business sales helps retain the diversity of our locallyowned businesses and each areaâ€™s unique character, and the increased vitality makes an area more welcoming to people allaround. The result is a socially connected community anchored by vibrant local business districts that are safe and pleasant for residents to bike and walk to.","&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Working with Business Improvement Districts and community groups in LA and around the U.S. since 1999 on sustainable urban transport and placemaking, urban operations, events, marketing, and public outreach.


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Creating BicycleFriendly Business District programs across the U.S. and Canada, including: the first such program in Long Beach, CA, in four districts (video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYlfdxGGs); the second program in San Diego, CA, in 18 districts (video: https://vimeo.com/60624768); inspiring the third program in New York, NY; creating the fourth effort in Oakville, ON; and starting the creation of many other efforts around the U.S. and Canada.


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Having our work featured in several bicycling, urban planning, and general media publications, and helping Long Beach garner significant media attention. Receiving awards for our BicycleFriendly Business District work and being asked to speak around the continent at 30 conferences/cities over the past year and a half.


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Producing free community rides and lasting media, such as this one in Long Beachâ€™s Cambodia Town with the notable band Dengue Fever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeqc8exO1oo.


&nbsp;</p>â€¢	Being the subject of Copenhagenâ€™s Bicycle Manager, Andreas Rohlâ€™s grant to study our work in Long Beach and San Diego in an effort to implement our ideas in Copenhagen.","&nbsp;</p>Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition and its local chapters and neighborhood bike ambassadors, L.A. Streetsblog, local Business Improvement Districts and other business associations, small business owners, student interns, and neighborhood councils.","&nbsp;</p>We believe in evaluating our projects through both data and personal stories. For this project we will measure in four primary ways:


&nbsp;</p>


1.	Business Perception Survey: Ask business association leaders and business owners how they feel about bicycling, bicyclists, bike lanes, and so on, and what percentage of their customers they think arrive via bike, walking, transit, or car. Survey issued at start of the program and again at the end (same survey, same people).


&nbsp;</p>


2.	Customer Behavior Survey: Conduct intercept surveys of customers to see how they arrived at each district. Survey issued at start of program.


&nbsp;</p>


3.	Program Element Tracking: Track the results of each program element (number of people who park their bikes at bike valets, participate in the free basic bike repairs, attend community rides, and so on).


&nbsp;</p>


4.	Business and Customer Testimonials: Stories gathered from BID leaders, business owners, and other district stakeholders about how bicycling is/has become part of their life/business.


","&nbsp;</p>There are currently 38 Business Improvement Districts in the City of Los Angeles, several other business associations, and hundreds of other business groups around LA County. Several have approached us, wanting to create bicyclefriendly business district initiatives after seeing our success in other cities, but lacking the seed money to kickstart them. This grant will create five successful programs and serve as examples for others to replicate. Program work will be broadcast by LA Streetsblog to countywide and national audiences and through media releases. 


&nbsp;</p>Through this program, we are cultivating future leaders in this emerging sector by building ties between local advocates and business owners and by engaging interns with diverse backgrounds to learn a unique blend of business, planning, and communication skills. Our future economy will rely on individuals who can bridge barriers and collaborate with people in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.


&nbsp;</p>Why is bicycling important for LAâ€™s neighborhoods and local businesses? Bicyclists travel at human scale speed and are more connected to their surroundings than if whizzing by in a car. They can easily stop and say hi to friends, hop off, park for free, and patronize a business. Bicyclists shop more frequently and spend more money cumulatively than those arriving by other modes. Sometimes they become repeat customers and get to know the business owner by name. Itâ€™s oldfashioned Americanism at its best. Itâ€™s when a family of four chooses to spend its Saturday afternoon bicycling to the local toy or ice cream shop instead of driving across town to a mall. 


&nbsp;</p>When businesses make deliveries and run errands via bicycle â€“ whether itâ€™s one companyâ€™s bike or shared district bikes â€“ business owners who never met before become acquainted and interact more. Business Improvement Districts who conduct some of their operations and promotions via bike instead of car become more connected to the communities theyâ€™re representing. 


&nbsp;</p>Bicyclists in business districts bring more â€˜eyes and earsâ€™ to keep an area safe, vibrant, and connected. Increased bicycling also correlates to decreased driving, traffic, car speeds, and parking congestion. It brings safer public streets for all users.


&nbsp;</p>Bicycling â€“ exercise, fresh air, and social interaction â€“ improves the emotional, mental and physical health of children and adults. It increases happiness, improves school and work performance, and decreases obesity, heart disease, asthma, depression, and social alienation.


&nbsp;</p>Encouraging humanscale traveling and interaction is key to revitalizing our struggling small business districts and putting LA on the map as a livable place and destination.","&nbsp;</p>By 2050, all business districts in LA County will have integrated bicycling into their existing operations and promotions. They will do this after becoming aware â€“ through the success of other districts â€“ that itâ€™s a core part of their emergency preparedness, business revenues, community vitality, and the social fabric that supports their existence. The education and actions by local businesses to integrate bicycling meaningfully into their districts will have created a business advocacy base for safer bicycle infrastructure so that by 2050, LA will have a more developed system of safe bike lanes and increased ridership.


&nbsp;</p>


Vibrant local business districts will be at the center of community life, with safe and convenient biking and walking connections to neighborhoods. The 38 BIDs in the City of LA and hundreds across LA County will multiply as the economy shifts to favor local retail, prompting redoubled investment in currently struggling commercial corridors. Bicycling and walking to local destinations will be how families choose to spend their leisure time because it is pleasant and social."
3102109,2013109,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/REACHINGOURYOUTH.html,Youth Outreach Unit Together We Create a Better Y.O.U., Public Safety,"Founded in 1999 V2K H.E.L.P.E.R. Foundation (formerly known as Venice 2000) is a non-profit organization that was originally established to provide gang intervention and prevention services.  Since that time, weâ€™ve come to believe that â€œcommunity-interventionâ€ services are needed now more than ever to combat gang-related violence, the destruction of our communities and the loss of our young people to the lure of economic depravity. 





The goal of V2K H.E.L.P.E.R. (Help Establish Learning Peace Economics and Righteousness) Foundation is to provide the resources and guidance to help struggling youth and community members of all ages make the transition from negative, anti-social behavior to positive, value centered alternatives.  





Working in some to the most challenged neighborhoods in Los Angeles HELPER Foundation changes young lives, and in doing so it is changing the city one child, one family at a time.  The organizationâ€™s mission enables to foster strong, self sufficient familyâ€™s, joyful and resilient children and vibrant safe communities. 


In this program we propose to improve public safety by focusing on the primary systems of internal family structure through a comprehensive V2K-HELPER -â€œ Y.O.U.,â€ Wrap Around approach.  Our family support work is predicated on the assertion that outcomes for youth cannot be separated from family conditions since families are the primary system for promoting childrenâ€™s physical, emotional, and cognitive development.   As we know once we change the economic structure of the family, improve family conditions  emotionally, and physically we are likely to reduce levels of violence and create safer communities. 


Our programs are organized into three programmatic divisions that synergistically reach all members of the community in a wrap around fashion.  Our programming provides Child & Youth Development programs provide at-risk children and young people a range of activities designed to enhance their healthy, pro-social development and address issues that include self-efficacy, self-confidence, resilience,  peaceful co-existence, anti-bullying, mentoring, and life success. Parent Education & Family Development programs work with parents to develop their capacity as advocates and champions for their children and to enhance their ability to achieve economic stability and success.  Mental Health programs assist children, youth and adults by providing them the tools needed to enhance social and relationship connections and emotional health.  





Youth Outreach Unit V2K Community Development Program has five components and implementation is carefully sequenced over a 12 month period.  These five components of the program target the risk factors related to prevent anti-social behavior, incarceration,  gang involvement and substance abuse. 


ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT 


LIFE SKILLS / PARENTING COMPONENT 


SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE 


ANTISOCIAL /AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR; VIOLENCE 


WHOLE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH 


The program works to improve the planning and organizational effectiveness of the collaborative and parents; the use of the successful integration of workshops, classroom instruction, and the implementation of positive behavioral programs, Public Safety and Community Awareness .


 


It is the Wrap Around Approach that enhances our ability to present programming that build and develops the entire family unit.  Thus  servicing Youth, Family and Community.  





The following constituencies and services will be provided under the program umbrella titled â€œY.O.Uâ€ (Youth Outreach Unit).  All services and activities are strategies for youth violence prevention and intervention.





â€¢	 Forty (40) at-risk middle and high school youth ages of 12 to 21 will participate in programming that focuses on  (Resilience, Reasoning, Responsibility and Respect) receiving mentoring and life skills training.  


â€¢	All participants come together in the Y.O.U. (Youth Outreach Unit). â€œY.O.U.â€ implements a unique mentoring model that uses a cross generational approach to violence prevention/intervention. The participants of the programs will implement IMPACT sessions.





Specific activities in the violence prevention programs include:


â€¢	Self management, social, interpersonal, and emotional (expression, understanding and regulation) skills training.


â€¢	Behavior monitoring and reinforcement


â€¢	Building school success capacity


â€¢	Cooperative Learning


â€¢	Problem solving skills development


â€¢	Promotion of cognitive and moral reasoning skills


â€¢	Development of positive peer relations


â€¢	Creation of a positive , anti-bullying climate





The programs have demonstrated positive effects on several risk factors associated with violence including aggressive behavior, anxiety and depression, conduct problems and lack of self control.  


","V2K HELPER Foundationâ€™s overarching achievement is having won the trust of the community it serves.  The organization has been a resource for families for over 13 years, continually refining programs and services to best meet the changing needs of a diverse population.  Consequently V2K HELPER has access to a large population of low- and middle-income families who trust the organization to provide respectful guidance and effective services.





The organization is consistently sought out as a collaborative partner by other community agencies and has an excellent track record of responsibly managing funding from state, county, public, private, and corporate funders.  Following are some specific ways V2K HELPER has been recognized as exemplifying excellence in its field:





â€¢	Since 1999, V2K-HELPER  has been funded by the City of Los Angeles services to implement a comprehensive violence prevention/intervention  program.


â€¢	Since 2007, V2K-HELPER has implemented City of Los Angeles GRYD Program in multiple Zones, providing services to youth and young adults  with an annual budget of at least $750,000.  


â€¢	Community Development, with an emphasis on low-to-moderate (LMI) communities and individuals addressing: small business education, business retention, entrepreneurial and employment training, and workforce development programs 


â€¢	Community Development, with an emphasis on affordable housing 


â€¢	Currently we provide  direct service and linkages to the following services free of charge each month to approximately 200 men, women and children:


o	Comprehensive wrap-around services  that include 


ï‚§	counseling, 


ï‚§	gang intervention, 


ï‚§	conflict resolution, 


ï‚§	 substance abuse, 


ï‚§	Job training and placement services, 


ï‚§	tattoo removal, 


ï‚§	mental health services


We provide a myriad of services throughout Los Angeles County, with primary emphasis in Venice Beach and South Central Los Angeles.  Our academic arm provides a professionally and socially enriched facility for graduate and undergraduate training.  Venice 2000/ H.E.L.P.E.R.  Foundation  is considered to be a model at-risk youth service facility and therefore attracts interns and social work students from major universities, such as USC, Loyola Marymount University, and University of California Los Angeles.    We subscribe to comprehensive, integrated, community-based collaborative approach providing services to youth that enhances community safety while strengthening and preserving families.  Our guiding philosophy is that children and youth must be preserved if the integrity of our society at-large is to be preserved.  If families are to be responsible units, they must have access to healthy living environments, adequate food, and education for all its members, employment, and access to health services and freedom from gang, domestic and civil violence.  


","The Cease Fire Committee is comprised of organizations ranging from HELPER foundation to Los Angeles Police Department.  Youth, Faith Based, Recreation, Law Enforcement, Schools, and Senior Citizen Organizations are a part of The Cease Fire Committee.   





Additionally we have a forged a strong strategic alliance with Starview Community Services. 





Star View Community Services provides programs for children, adolescents, and transitional age youth who face emotional, behavioral, and learning challenges and have difficulty succeeding in family or community living environments. An experienced staff of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health specialists, and other counselors provide case management and  mental health care. ","Integrated, ongoing evaluation is a critical part of all of V2K HELPERâ€™S  activities.  Both process and outcome measures are used in all programs to gauge participant satisfaction, aspects requiring modification, and progress on measurable objectives. Various evaluation instruments are used agency-wide to determine program effectiveness such as pre/post surveys, interviews, and satisfaction surveys.





Specific evaluation instruments that the agency has developed in conjunction with professional evaluation consultants include:





â€¢	Client l Engagement Instrument -- measures increases in parental interactive reading time with children, parental involvement in childrenâ€™s education, and use of community resources and social networks


â€¢	Family Strengths and Challenges Assessment â€“ 11 scales that measure family conditions from basic needs to social support


â€¢	Resident Group Outcomes Instrument â€“ measures strength of social support and increases in engagement and self-agency





Additionally, as evidence of the agencyâ€™s commitment to program efficacy, V2K HELPER is currently engaged in a City of Los Angelesâ€™ Gang Reduction and Youth Development initiative focused on enhancing the agencyâ€™s evaluation capacity by strengthening and deepening its evaluation protocols.  Utilizing a comprehensive, state-of-the art software program, Efforts to Outcomes, data collection will be universalized across the agency and used to drive effective program practice in the future.  


","  Demographic experts tell us that if juvenile crime rates for persons 10 to 17 continue to increase with expected youth population increases, the year 2010 will see the number of juvenile-committed violent crimes increase by nearly 15 percent.





     However, these projections do not have to be America's destiny.  Over the past two years, there has been a decline in the rates of both murders committed by youth and youth violence in general. While the juvenile violent crime arrest rate increased 62% between 1987 and 1993, it decreased 2.9% in 1995, the first decline in seven years.  


     


As the problem of juvenile violence has grown, so has our understanding of the problem and some possible solutions.  A small percentage of youth are responsible for the bulk of violent juvenile crime; most violent crimes committed by youth are committed against other juveniles; and many involve handguns and/or drug use.  Violence is a learned behavior and children neglected, left alone, or uncared for, without appropriate role models, often do not learn right from wrong.  Children who suffer abuse at the hands of family violence often learn that violence is natural, even expected.





The success of our V2K Community Development Program has been positively correlated with a multitude of public service assistance.  Experts agree that the best predictors of successful transition are: an intensively supportive environment, counseling, mentoring, education, drug treatment, and opportunities for employment.  A highly structure multidisciplinary case plan and customized youth services are unavoidably intertwined as a means to successfully engage youth and propel them towards a productive future.  The unique program design and topic courses that we have created with the target population  in mind (i.e. safety, date rape, gang abatement, self-esteem, childcare, health care, rape crisis counseling, youth support, anger management, violence awareness, mentoring, academic assistance, communication, etc.) will especially benefit minors who have a propensity to engage in criminal and delinquent behavior.  Many experts agree that the way one thinks, leads to the way an individual behaves.





Delinquency and youth crime affect not only the victims, but has a â€œdomino effectâ€ on the entire community regardless of the severity of the crime.  As youth crime prevails, community fear increases, public safety costs rise, and insecurities abound.  It costs more than $40,000 annually to maintain a juvenile in a correctional facility.  It costs about $4,000 a year to keep a young person in school.   As a result of the erosion of the value of the â€œfamilyâ€, the rising costs for education, an increase in prison construction, dilapidated school systems, and cutbacks in state and federal funding, agencies have to rethink their approach to program service delivery.  Our ultimate challenge is to debunk various published statistics and promote awareness for what goes on in our community.","Gangs and gang violence are the result of a many complex social issues, including poverty, lack of educational opportunities, addictive and mental health disorders, scarce job opportunities, and traumatic events in the lives of gang members. Our  comprehensive wrap-around services address the clientsâ€™ needs and help them redirect their lives. We aid the entire family unit creating the opportunity for complete behavior modification through support and the overall reduction of risk factors. Through this program, we will provide awareness, resources and support that is crucial to ending the violence that plague many the communities that we serve. 


Success in the year 2050 would mean families and communities we serve would no longer be overcome by violence and despair, but would have hope instilled because awareness, access and resources.

3102110,2013110,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Hammer_Museum.html,Arts ReSTORE LA: Westwood. An urban renewal project by the Hammer Museum,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"The Hammer Museum proposes to tap into the thriving Los Angeles creative community as a strategy to revitalize communities and villages throughout the city. Los Angeles faces some significant challenges posed by urban sprawl, lack of a comprehensive public transportation system, and traffic congestion, and as a result, it often feels like a collection of smaller disparate areas. Given the incredible artistic and entrepreneurial output that is now happening in Los Angeles (the most concentrated in the world), there is a real opportunity to infuse the artists, artisans, craftspeople and creative makers of all kinds into neighborhoods as a unique and effective way to help define and energize them. Specifically, the Hammer would use its incredible network of local talent and expertise in arts and culture to curate an artisanal popup village in Westwood and offer a long term strategy to turn the neighborhood around permanently.  


 


We propose to work with the building owners in the village to provide work and retail space for artists and artisans in greater Los Angeles to sell their wares and artistic output.  Westwood has struggled significantly in recent years due to a confusing identity, and lagging commercial real estate market. Even though Westwood Village is highly walkable and convenient, with parking all around, there is a consistently high rate of retail vacancies and turnover of existing businesses. On Westwood Blvd, the main thoroughfare in the Village, and adjacent to the Hammer, 30 of the 78 storefronts are vacant â€“ earning Westwood Village the highest retail vacancy rate in west Los Angeles. We believe this once thriving neighborhood can recover if it approaches its troubles with a strategy that has proved effective over and over again throughout the countryâ€”work with the creative community. 


 


The Hammer has already had extensive conversations with the key property owners who share our stake in the neighborhood about ways to reinvigorate what should be an energetic and economically healthy community. Our vision is that the Hammer would curate a popup village (like a group exhibition) of artists, artisans and makers of all kinds to activate these empty unused spaces with designers of furniture, clothing, ceramics, jewelry and other locally produced goods and crafts.  In advance of the holiday season we would offer a place for an eclectic array of object makers to display their work.  Artists could also use the spaces as open studios where they could engage with the public and exhibit and sell artwork. 


 


Additionally, the Hammer has proposed to the owners of several vacant restaurants that a curated series of emerging chefs be in residence at the various locations during the length of the popup village. The Hammer would be the gateway to the village and accordingly would market and promote the popup village and would hold anchor events, such as performances, music sets by local DJs, art installations, etc. in our public Courtyard. For the period of the popup village, we would make affordable parking available (it is currently only $3.00) and create maps and informational brochures on the participating artists and create tiein experiences between the Hammer and artist storefronts and events. 


 


While this initial pilot idea would be akin to a curated live version of etsy.com, the goal would be to sustain and replicate the idea to revitalize the neighborhood permanently.  The Hammer would help facilitate a longer presence of artists as merchants in Westwood Village, working as a facilitator between all stakeholders. We would also seek to serve as a catalyst and replicate this model beyond the grant period in other neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, contributing to a future for Los Angeles where strong community development is fueled by the arts. 


","Over the past decade plus, the Hammer Museum has transformed itself into one of the most innovative and wellrespected arts and cultural institutions in Los Angeles. One important focus of our exhibitions and artist programs is highlighting emerging and underrecognized artists. Last summer we organized L.A.â€™s first ever biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. 2012, which showcased 60 emerging local artists in four venues across the city.  The Hammer is also proud of its 14 year old Hammer Projects exhibition series which features emerging local and international artists in what is often their first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Through our public engagement program, launched in 2010, the Hammer has established itself as a leader in innovation through unique and unexpected artist projects that challenge visitorsâ€™ notions of traditional museum experiences. As a cultural center, the Hammer also attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year to our multidisciplinary public programs which take place in our stateoftheart Billy Wilder Theater and adjacent Courtyard, and which include literary readings, artist performances, film screenings, musical acts, meditation sessions, and scholarly and popular culture presentations. All of the Hammerâ€™s public programs are free to the public and we feel strongly that we could be helpful to both artists and our neighbors if the vitality and sense of community that the Hammer enjoys could spill out into our commercial neighborhood as well.  ","So far, the Hammer has laid considerable groundwork to implement this idea in Westwood Village during summer 2013. We have met with the property owners of vacant storefronts in the Village to ensure free or minimal rents, and have had several dialogues with stakeholders and partners at UCLA, including CityLAB, part of the Department of Architecture and Urban Design, and the Center for the Art of Performance. 


We also plan to work with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority to help promote the Village over the summer on the routes that stop near Westwood, and would reach out to existing businesses, student groups, neighborhood councils, press outlets, etc. to help realize the project. The Hammer would also leverage its popular","We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate this project and use this data to help craft sustainability plans (more permanent artists presence in Westwood Village) as well as replication plans (curating artists projects in other neighborhoods and communities). We will track foot traffic, visitors to artistsâ€™ stores and existing businesses in the village, press coverage, sales figures, and Hammer attendance. We will also solicit feedback through our social media channels from visitors and participating artists. One of the goals of this initiative is to further the Hammerâ€™s mission of supporting artists and their careers, and an important measure of success will be how this experience enables artists to engage with new audiences, sell their work, and increase their visibility in the community. ","In the past 25 years Los Angeles has become a thriving cultural economy with 1 in 8 jobs within the creative sector, and the city has earned a reputation as a premier arts destination. Yet while there is now so much creative energy and talent across Los Angeles, there isnâ€™t a cohesive approach to connect artists to audiences in a way that integrates and revitalizes the existing infrastructure of communities and neighborhoods. And there is no direct artist to consumer opportunity except for occasional festivals and fairs. Temporary or narrowly defined opportunities exist, such as farmers markets, arts festivals and businesssponsored artist commissions, but these lack the type of lasting impact on place that we seek to address.  And although Los Angeles has no shortage of shopping opportunities or dedicated areas with a high concentration of retail businesses, it is more difficult to find a place where residents and tourists can access unique, locally or handmade products on an ongoing basis. This proposed movement of instigating artisanal marketplaces in underutilized communities has the potential for a lasting impact on these neighborhoods, with popup markets developing into longterm storefronts featuring L.A. artists and their products. ","Los Angeles would continue its climb as a leading creative center in the nation, and as a top tourist destination for arts and culture (beyond beach and amusement parks). The local artists community would be nourished, thrive, and enjoy real and meaningful connections with residents of the City. The arts would have an important place in economic revitalization strategies, and urban design and planning would consider the impact and influence of arts and artists as a matter of course. Neighborhoods and communities, such as Westwood Village would become vibrant marketplaces that defy homogenization and regularly feature unique locallycrafted wares, and places where new artists can be discovered. Cultural institutions would consider it part of their mission to investigate and influence their surrounding neighborhoods by connecting their artistic expertise and output with the specific needs and capabilities of the community.

3102111,2013111,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/HARMONYPROJECT.html,Harmony Project , Education,"Harmony Project is an awardwinning 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that targets lowincome atrisk youth in underserved areas of Los Angeles. Founded in 2001 by a doctor of public health, Harmony Project is built upon the latest social science research on arts education. With a strong focus on peer mentorship, family support, and college incentives, Harmony Project changes the course of disadvantaged childrenâ€™s lives. A feature that distinguishes Harmony Project among local arts education programs is that we commit to children throughout their entire childhood, regardless of their changing schools and circumstances.  Students benefit intellectually, emotionally, socially and even physically, and their involvement in our programs sets a foundation for greater wellbeing now and in the future.  





Beginning in 2001 with only 36 students, Harmony Project currently commits to 1500 students for their entire childhood â€“ from elementary and middle school through high school and beyond â€“ to ensure they receive the support and guidance needed to graduate high school and continue to college. The students we serve come from families whoâ€™s income is within 185% of the federal poverty level, which is the same income test as the federal school meal subside.  By virtue of the neighborhoods and poverty in which they live, Harmony Projectâ€™s target population is at risk for juvenile involvement in gangs, drug and alcohol abuse, aggression, school dropout, teenage pregnancy and parenting, depression, and suicide. Most of our programs are located within Los Angelesâ€™ twelve Gang Reduction & Youth Development Zones designated by the Mayorâ€™s Office, neighborhoods up to four square miles in area where documented rates of violent gang crime are 400% greater than elsewhere in the city. While dropout rates exceed 50% in the Los Angeles communities we serve, 95% of Harmony Projectâ€™s high school seniors have graduated in four years and virtually all have gone on to college or trade school.  





We look forward to a future Los Angeles that is rich in culture, music education programs and performing ensembles throughout all of its diverse neighborhoods. Harmony Project firmly believes that wealth should not be a prerequisite to the accessibility of music education and the myriad of benefits that result from the study and practice of this. The study and practice of music provides a wide range of benefits in terms of cognitive and social development (e.g., improved academic performance, selfesteem, behavior) and at a physiological level, learning music rewires the brain and nervous system in ways that improve language learning, support math achievement and effective listening, and help students develop both patience and focus. Furthermore, music builds community that cuts across barriers of class and culture, bringing together and celebrating diversity, while also creating a wideranging network of likeminded and involved citizens.  





Specifically through our Peer Mentoring program, Harmony Project is shaping the future of Los Angeles by creating a conglomerate of educated, creative, and dedicated alumni who not only will become active members of society, but more importantly are learning to become advocates for themselves, their neighbors, and their communities. The seed of giving back is planted early on in Harmony Project participants. Whether you are a student mentee, a student mentor, or one of the professional teaching artists, this multigenerational system teaches the importance of working within a community and the importance of reinvesting in where you have come from. It is not just the 100 mentors a year or the 200+ mentees that are influenced by the success of this program.  The positive results are felt within the entire culture of Harmony Project, affecting each of the 1,500 students that go through the program yearly. As a result, an endless ripple effect is created through generations of Harmony Project participants, their families, and the surrounding community now and as they continue through life. 





Involvement in the intensive and demanding Peer Mentoring program helps to keep older students engaged in music throughout adolescence, giving them purpose and motivation to complete the Harmony Project program, graduate from high school, and continue onto college.  Students must be enrolled in school, turn in report cards, and show musical and character progress in order to continue participation in Harmony Project programs. We find that when older students are selected and trained to take leadership roles, they eagerly rise to the occasion and inturn inspire younger students to follow their example. Peertopeer mentoring develops leadership capacity and responsibility, teaching and mentoring skills among our older students as well as builds relationships that cut across barriers of class, age, and culture, creating a sense of inclusion and comradery.


","The Harmony Project has won numerous accolades, including the Coming Up Taller Award from the Presidentâ€™s Committee on the Arts & Humanities â€“ the nationâ€™s highest honor for an artsbased youth program.  We have been featured in the Los Angeles Times and on NBC and CBS Nightly News, PBSâ€™ Turning Point, CBS Early Show, Hallmark Channelâ€™s Naomiâ€™s New Morning, Univisionâ€™s Despierta America and Orgullo Hispano, ABCâ€™s Eye on LA and Vista LA, Hot 92 JAMZ, KXN Radio and other media outlets.





A feature that distinguishes Harmony Project among other local arts education programs is that we commit to children throughout their entire childhood, regardless of their changing schools and circumstances.  With a strong focus on peer mentorship, family support, and college incentives, Harmony Project changes the course of disadvantaged childrenâ€™s lives.  While dropout rates exceed 50% in the communities we serve, 95% of Harmony Projectâ€™s high school seniors have graduated in four years and virtually all have gone on to college or trade school.  In addition, Harmony Project provides college incentives and scholarship opportunities to help facilitate the difficult transition to college.  In May, we learned that one of our former students, Brettany Tucker, became a Fulbright Scholar for the 201213 school year! Moreover, four current students were accepted and now attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, one of the premier public arts high schools in the US!





In January, Harmony Projectâ€™s YOLA/EXPO orchestra attended master classes with SÃ­mÃ³n BolÃ­var Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, and also performed together at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Downtown LA.  In attendance was El Sistema founder JosÃ© Antonio Abreu â€“ El Sistema is the hugely successful Venezuelan music program that Harmony Project is in part modeled after.  In addition, the YOLA/EXPO orchestra has recently had the opportunity to perform with renowned conductor Sir Simon Rattle, Gustavo Dudamel, Stevie Wonder, and on the Tonight Show with Rickey Minor.


","We are grateful to have a wide network of partnerships that support our endeavors to promote positive youth development and also provide facility space for children to learn in safe, nurturing environments.  These include The Professional Musicianâ€™s Union Local 47, LA City College, The Department of Recreation and Parks and the LA Philharmonic at Expo Center. We also partner with LAUSD and LAUSDâ€™s Beyond the Bell branch as well as Lennox, Lawndale, Wiseburn School Districts, and Glassell Park Elementary School. We also work with the Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, Vince Womack at the Foshay Learning Center, Brotherhood Crusade, Blazer Youth Center, Lula Washington, PS Arts, the World Stage and Barbara Morrison in Leimert Park.","Harmony Project closely tracks each studentâ€™s musical progress as well as character development twice annually. Musical progress is an important process objective because it correlates with student engagement in the program. Character development is based upon responsibility, commitment, community, selfdiscipline, attitude, resourcefulness.  





Student enrollment levels and characteristics â€“ including detailed information on those that have exited the program â€“ are regularly reported at board meetings. We use the ETO data system to track and report student outcomes. Submission of school report cards is also part of each studentâ€™s annual application package. We will look at the growth of the mentor program as well as the retention rate of mentors, program participants, teaching artists, and staff.





Progress towards our primary goal of positive change in our students is assessed through surveys and regular interaction with the families we serve. In our most recent impact evaluation survey, a high percentage of parents indicated that  since joining the Harmony Project  their child has shown improvement in his/her grades (74%), behavior (78%), mood (76%), and health (68%).


","Harmony Project exists to serve lowincome families, for whom the program is provided at no cost.  Harmony Project founder, Dr. Margaret Martin, saw how music can shape intellectual development in underserved children and bring hope and greater wellbeing to families facing substantial challenges.  With rare exception, we accept only those families whose income is below 185% of federal poverty level (this corresponds to the eligibility criteria for the Los Angeles Unified School Districtâ€™s free/reduced lunch program). The neighborhoods we serve must have at least 50% of students eligible for the lunch program.  





Currently, studentsâ€™ age range is from 618, with an average age of 11; 59% are female and 41% are male. The demographics of the 1,659 unduplicated youth we serve are: 70% Latino, 10% AfricanAmerican, 10% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2% White, and 8% Mixed/Other/ Unknown. 





By virtue of their poverty and the neighborhoods in which they live, Harmony Projectâ€™s target population is at risk for juvenile involvement in gangs, drug and alcohol abuse, aggression, school dropout, teenage pregnancy and parenting, depression, and suicide.  Most of our programs are located within Los Angelesâ€™ twelve Gang Reduction & Youth Development Zones designated by the Mayorâ€™s Office, neighborhoods up to four square miles in area where documented rates of violent gang crime are 400% greater than elsewhere in the city. The study and practice of music provides a wide range of benefits in terms of cognitive and social development (e.g., improved academic performance, selfesteem, behavior).


With cutbacks in public education, no music program in Los Angeles is providing the type of program that can deliver these benefits.  The RAND Corporationâ€™s 2004 report entitled, Gifts of the Muse:  Reframing the Debate About the Benefits of Arts, highlights that â€œthe most important benefits require sustained involvement in the arts.â€  Even with the many arts organizations in the city, no other commits to students for their entire childhood, providing a handson, yearround program with high expectations, and other program elements research has shown to be effective in fostering positive changes in participants.





Harmony Project is providing services to communities that otherwise remain isolated and invisible.  The students and families participating in Harmony Project today are the future of Los Angeles.  We are creating the next generation of community members who will be educated, productive members of society and who will be eager to seek out, support, promote and participate in a Los Angeles rich in culture and music.  These participants who graduate today will come back to invest, teach, and support social programs that will benefit new generations to come.


","We look towards a future Los Angeles where high school graduation is the rule, not the exception.  Our vision of success includes sustaining the high school graduation rate of 95% throughout our program participants in order to create a diverse Los Angeles community of educated professionals who are active and engaged in sustaining a community rich in culture and accessible programs that provide access to music education. We believe that by continuing to build on our successful Peer Mentoring program that has proven to help see kids through high school and college, we are helping to break the cycle of poverty and shaping the future of Los Angeles.

3102112,2013112,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/healthyneighborhoods.html,Heal the Bays Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Environment Initiative, Environmental Quality,"Most human health issues prevalent in urban areas have at their root an environmental component. Whether it is air pollution and asthma, water pollution and infectious diseases, urban blight and psychosocial disorders, or poor planning (no parks and lots of junk food outlets) and obesity, there is a nexus between the built environment and human health, between environmental health and community health. Since 2005, Heal the Bay has served as an educational and advocacy resource for those residing within the Compton Creek Watershed, an impaired 42square mile subwatershed of the Los Angeles River Watershed. The region is historically underserved, parkpoor, severely economically challenged, suffers from chronic litter problems, and is also home to one of Californiaâ€™s most polluted waterbodies  Compton Creek. The Creek, which is on the State's list of impaired waterbodies, drains portions of the City of Los Angeles (Watts, Vermont Knolls), South Gate, Lynwood, Compton, and Los Angeles County (Florence/Firestone, Willowbrook, Athens), before discharging into the Los Angeles River and San Pedro Bay.





Through our work in the Compton Creek Watershed, we have witnessed for ourselves this lack of understanding regarding the relationship of the environment in studentsâ€™, residentsâ€™, and policymakersâ€™ lives. As such, it is impossible to affect behavioral change for a healthier environment if the agents of the change do not know the issues, see themselves as having a role, or the tools to make it happen.





For this grant, Heal the Bay intends to target the next generation through our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiative (HNHE), specifically through our Environmental Corps campaign. We will target the scholastic youth of a specific unified school district in the South Los Angeles area; we will develop new leaders who have an understanding of the nexus between environmental and community health through the lens of water. The HNHEâ€™s programs are designed to provide participants a holistic approach to understanding, addressing, and ultimately changing their environment. 





The Environment Corps has nine educational and actionoriented programming elements to engage a majority, if not all, grade levels (K12) in a unified school district. The program takes into consideration EEI (Education and the Environment) essential principles and concepts, state and national academic content standards, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) principles, and steeps them in local social, cultural, and economic conditions when implemented. 





The Environment Corps consists of: Speakers Bureau, Santa Monica Pier Aquariumâ€™s Youth Environmental Education Program, Aqua Explorers, Lunch nâ€™ Learn, Coastal Cleanup Education Day, â€œThe Story of Water,â€ Creek 101, Youth/Teacher Summits, and DigiGreen.  





By inundating a school district over a fivemonth period with environmental programming, students, teachers, parents and district officials are all simultaneously experiencing a similar environmental literacy campaign at the same time. In addition, this targeted population will possess a level of understanding between environment and community to begin making informed decisions about follow through with behavioral changes.





In todayâ€™s economic climate, we often have a difficult time justifying spending money on environmental projects, no matter how critical, when money is so desperately needed to fund our schools.  We would embrace this grant as an opportunity to close that gap, and bestow muchneeded funds and resources to a school district, while moving the marker forward on environmental change. 





Through our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiative (HN/HE) Environment Corps, we are committed to:





Working with a specific school district to foster ontheground environmental improvement projects (e.g. campus and neighborhood cleanups, campus gardens);





Providing highquality, standardsaligned environmental education curriculum for thousands of students and their teachers through our partnerships with schools (prek12th grade), colleges and youthserving organizations; 





Coordinating presentations about environmental issues and solutions where students live, attend school, and recreate; 





Creating opportunities to participate in capacitybuilding workshops (e.g. how to communicate with policymakers), teambuilding summits (e.g. the power of networking and community organizing); and handson stewardship activities (e.g. removing trash from the banks of Compton Creek); 





Strengthening civic engagement outcomes by mobilizing students in a specific school district;





Grooming the next generation of environmental leaders tasked with leading the charge in 10 years, 2050, and beyond.





These programs working together in a focused manner will increase student access to parks and local open spaces, allowing them to participate in programs that benefit the local watershed.","Founded in 1985, Heal the Bay is a nonprofit environmental organization making Southern California coastal waters and watersheds, including Santa Monica Bay, safe, healthy and clean. We use science, education, community action and advocacy to fulfill our mission.





Heal the Bay's first major challenge as a grassroots organization was taking on the Los Angelesâ€™ Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. At the time, Hyperion was breaking the law on several counts, including the dumping of sewage sludge into the Bay. Heal the Bay attacked on many fronts: holding rallies at the beach, informing the media and the public about what was happening, packing hearing rooms, testifying before regulatory agencies, and signing up members along the coast. Due in large part to Heal the Bayâ€™s efforts, the City of Los Angeles was forced to rebuild Hyperion and stop dumping sludge into the Bay. In the years since, Heal the Bay has been overjoyed to see the return of plant and animal life to the former ""dead"" zone in the Bay, and to know that ocean users are much less likely to become ill from swimming in contaminated coastal waters. 





Recent achievements:





The Education and Environment Initiative (EEI) 


As a coauthor of AB1548, more commonly known as the Education and the Environment Initiative (EEI), Heal the Bay has helped bring environmental education to classrooms throughout the state and at all grade levels. Staff continues to work closely with National Geographic and local school districts to ensure that the new curriculum is accessible to classroom educators and their students.





Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 


Due in large part to Heal the Bayâ€™s efforts, new MPAs have been established along the Southern California coastline. These underwater â€œsafe havensâ€ allow marine life, especially those fish stocks suffering from the great decline, to replenish and thrive. Heal the Bay will continue to educate ocean users, including anglers, about the benefits of MPA and monitor activities through our citizenled MPA Watch program.





Combating Plastic Pollution 


Heal the Bay continues to lead the charge on banning environmentally harmful and fiscally wasteful singleuse plastic bags throughout the state. Staff is gearing up to work closely with policymakers and additional stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of a bag ban in the City of Los Angeles.





Environmental Stewardship and Volunteerism 


An astounding 36,400 volunteers participated in Heal the Baycoordinated beach cleanups in Los Angeles County from November 2011September 2012 (includes Coastal Cleanup Day 2012).





The WAYS Reading & Fitness Park 


In partnership with Wisdom Academy for Young Scientists (a charter elementary school in South Los Angeles), Heal the Bay is developing a multiuse park, which will serve as an outdoor classroom, community green space, fitness area, and waterquality improvement project in a community that is already underserved and disproportionately lacking park space.  


","Heal the Bay plans on targeting one unified school district in order to implement Environmental Corps. 





There are two unified school districts we are currently evaluating: Lynwood and Inglewood. Based on district considerations and fit with other Heal the Bay programs and interest, we will make a decision prior to the grant awardâ€”if selected. 





Our partners for the respective school districts would be:


Lynwood: 12 elementary schools, 3 middle schools, 3 high schools, district administration, district board members, local PTA, and Booster Clubs.





Inglewood: 11 elementary, 2 middle schools, 4 high schools, district administration, district board members, local PTA and Booster Clubs.


","In order to evaluate the success of our Environment Corp programs, we will measure the following:





Results of a pre and post environmental literacy surveys that we will conduct; 





On theground environmental improvement projects and policies throughout the school districtâ€™s high schools (e.g. campus and neighborhood cleanups, increasing permeable campus space through the use of learning gardens);





Participation in public policy events (testifying, letter writing, or social media);





Participation in Heal the Baysponsored events (Coastal Cleanup Day, Day Without A Bag, and policy issue);





Total number of participants and those who state that they will matriculate into moreadvanced programs; 





The number of followers and/or participants related to our social media components over the grant period: Twitter parties, Instagram contests, Facebook posts, and Youtube posts.     





Each of the nine programs includes qualitative analysis of knowledge learned, skills gained, and attitude/perspective change  (one of the best indicators of behavior change). The specific evaluation technique changes from activity to activity. For example, Creek 101 uses simple pre and post test measures to evaluate base knowledge and acquired knowledge.


 


In addition to the above metrics for evaluation, Heal the Bay uses an internal â€˜logicâ€™ model to quantify program effectiveness. Finally, feedback from program participants and the community at large also helps us shape our programs, refine our messages and goals, and better communicate with our target audiences.


","Our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiativeâ€™s Environmental Corps campaign will benefit our fellow Angelenos by creating an entire community of educated and empowered individuals working to increase the amount of safe, clean, and healthy open space in the region, while also benefiting local waters and watersheds.  





We will work throughout the targeted district from kindergarten through high school, as well as working with parents and district staff, to ensure that they are all receiving consistent message points.





Most people are unaware of how they impact the environment both in negative and positive ways. Our programs will increase understanding of basic scientific concepts as they relate to the environment, issues of pollution, and methods of conservation and stewardship.  We will then take it a step further and work with the community and implement effective strategies of conservation such as community and school cleanups; creating learning gardens on campuses that increase permeable space; and provide students with easy access to green space, organizing campus recycling programs.  





Additionally, we will work with the communities to empower them to take on projects that they are passionate about as they relate to creating a healthier environment, providing access to experts, funds and volunteers to implement these projects.  





Our Speakers Bureau program is the easiest access point into our programs, providing information and conservation strategies to students and adults of all ages through assemblies at the schools. Elementary and middle school students will benefit from the Youth Environmental Education Program at Heal the Bayâ€™s Santa Monica Pier Aquarium (SMPA), which provides handson, standardsbased classroom field and labbased programs.  





We will target elementary school students through our Aqua Explorers program (a multiclass lesson for 3rd/4th graders in partnership with LA Neighborhood Land Trust, Childrenâ€™s Nature Institute and reDiscover; Lunch nâ€™ Learn (a combination classroom presentation with an educational beach field trip); and Coastal Cleanup Education Day (which takes 2nd5th graders through an intense day of exploration, education, and stewardship at the beach).  





We will target 8th grade students with the Story of Water 4week program, leading to a schoolwide behavioral change project.  Creek 101 will work with 6th12th grade students in a 3part class and field based education and stewardship program.  





Youth/Teacher Summits will provide indepth focused training to students and adults throughout the district.  Our new DigiGreen program will use social media and digital technologies to share ideas, experiences, and generate civic engagement and stewardship opportunities to all ages.    





","In the year 2050, Los Angeles will be a healthy, thriving, and desirable place to live.





Los Angeles will be a model green city with some of the best air and water quality in the nation due in large part to the invention and implementation of innovative green technologies at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach; the popularity of lowemission cars and LEED certified buildings;, solarpowered public transportation; strict, enforceable water quality standards; and fully implemented stormwater reclamation and reuse technologies (to address water supply needs).





Neighborhoods and waterways will be free of singleuse plastic bags and bottles, polystyrene, and products treated with Phthalates, including Bisphenol A, a chemical believed to be harmful for humans and marine life.





Highquality environmental education curriculum will be taught at all Los Angeles area schools (K12th grade) and will include ongoing stewardship opportunities. 





Environmental stewardship, neighborhood beautification efforts and coastal cleanups will be a key component of ongoing civic engagement.





Overall, our Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Environment Initiativeâ€™s Environmental Corps campaign will work to create a Los Angeles 2050 where people have access to parks and local open spaces, individuals and families would be able to interact with local waters without fear of infection or sickness, and all of the connections between environmental and community health will be positive ones.

3102113,2013113,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/heartofla.html,Visual Arts Education at Heart of Los Angeles,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Heart of Los Angeles (HOLA) is a nonprofit organization that provides atrisk and underserved youth ages 619 living in Los Angeles with free exceptional afterschool programming in academics, arts and athletics within a nurturing environment, empowering them to develop their potential, pursue their education and strengthen their communities. Since HOLA first opened its doors 24 years ago, thousands of elementary, middle and high school students have received superior academic support and enrichment activities that provide them with the tools they need to succeed. What began as a sanctuary from the streets for just a few kids is now a thriving 24,000 square foot campus serving 2,500 community youth each year.





In HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts program, over 250 students participate in 33 different visual arts classes each quarter, following a multilevel class structure that builds and advances with each successive session. This format allows young artists to progress in their skills and to build strong and lasting mentor/student relationships with their instructors. HOLA offers free classes in over 16 different art forms including ceramics, painting, drawing, screen printing, car design, printmaking, photography, architecture and fashion design. To broaden studentsâ€™ appreciation for the arts, throughout the year staff engages youth in cultural field trips to museums, art institutes, private art collections, art studios and cultural landmarks, as well as curating four art shows a year featuring student work.





HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts continues to develop innovative programming that ever more deeply engages youth to explore and give back to their community. At the core of this goal is the Public Art Project, now embarking on its second year. The Public Art Project engages youth and the community through classes, workshops, artist talks, field trips and public installations in and around HOLAâ€™s neighborhood. Each year, HOLA hires new artists or a collective to implement a public artthemed project during their residency. HOLA utilizes public art as a vehicle to connect established and emerging local artists to the Rampart and Westlake community and to collaborate with its members and LA organizations, using this culturally rich and diverse neighborhood as a canvas to create art. HOLA is located next to the prominent MacArthur Park, and has inspired dialogue in the park by designing creative and unique art installations. In its first year, artists Pearl C. Hsiung and Anna Sew Hoy collaborated with youth on We Are Talking Pyramids, a multimedia, multivenue public art project drawing inspiration from the park and the personal histories and everyday experiences of the students. 





The Public Art Project exposes students to myriad art forms, engages guest artists throughout the year and encourages its students to draw inspiration through selfreflection and engagement in their environment, but reaches even beyond the experiences of HOLAâ€™s students and artists. We Are Talking Pyramids culminated in a day of art and performance in conjunction with the LevittLA 50 Free Concerts at the Levitt Pavillion stage and various sites throughout MacArthur Park. The goals were to involve, activate and inspire local families and the community and to create new art in dialogue with the preexisting public sculptures and murals in the park. Over 2,000 people were in attendance for the event, an incredible starting point for the nascent Public Art Project.





The Visual Arts program is only one of HOLAâ€™s nine innovative, structured and rigorous programs. HOLAâ€™s elementary, middle school and high school programs are led by highly trained, credentialed teachers and supplemented with a wide variety of enrichment activities that include visual arts classes, a full youth orchestra and choir, private and group music lessons, premiere soccer and basketball leagues, leadership, language and culture classes. HOLA is committed to providing wraparound services for all of its youth, from targeted homework help to counseling and family services. To promote mental health, strong families, academic achievement and emotional development, HOLA provides its most atrisk students and their families with exceptional intervention and counseling services and resources. HOLA also employs a Parent and Community Resource Director who works to support effective communication with parents and to promote parent involvement in all of HOLAâ€™s youth development programs.





HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts program is a key component of a holistic approach to afterschool enrichment. Its students receive not only a substantive arts education, but comprehensive support that helps them change their life trajectory and attain a pathway out of poverty. It is critical that HOLA continue to expand its programs and provide as many atrisk Los Angeles youth as possible with hope for a better life, a community that believes in them and a place they can call home.","HOLAâ€™s recent achievements include:





 In the last academic year, 324 students participated in intensive art classes in a multilevel class structure that built and advanced with each session. Each quarter, HOLA offered the community 33 free visual art classes and 37 hours of professional art instruction.





 HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts students attended 19 field trips to museums, art institutions, art studios and more. HOLA also welcomed a diverse group of more than 36 visiting artists to its campus.





 The first year of the Public Art Project culminated in a communitywide event in MacArthur park that brought together more than 2,000 community members.





 In 2011, the completely renovated Lafayette Park Community Center reopened, an expansion that helped HOLA significantly increase the number of students served annually. Throughout its nine academic, enrichment and support programs, HOLA served 2,497 students in 2012, an increase of more than 60% from the prior year.





 HOLA provided FREE programming six days a week all year long.





 At the core of HOLAâ€™s success is a strong team of volunteers. HOLAâ€™s volunteer corps has grown to more than 700, 190 of which donated 10 hours or more in the last year alone. 





 The number of HOLAâ€™s youngest students performing at or above grade level increased from 69% to 84%





 While area high schoolsâ€™ graduation rates often fall below 50%, HOLA saw 100% of its seniors graduate from high school and enroll in colleges and universities across the country.





 The Alumni and Scholarship Program now supports over 150 alumni enrolled in 75 colleges and universities; of those students who began college in the last three years and participated in the formal Alumni Program, 93% are still enrolled in a two or fouryear institution.





 This year, HOLA awarded more than $195,000 in college scholarships to 83 alumni and assisted these students in securing over $1,189,972 in State, Federal and Institutional Funds.





 HOLA has consistently facilitated community engagement and helped to beautify and activate the Rampart neighborhood. In 2003, families were too scared to enter into the local park, but since HOLA partnered with LA City Recreation and Parks to bring unprecedented financial and programmatic resources, thousands of families now utilize Lafayette Park on a regular basis.","HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts partners include LACMA, MOCA, Otis College of Art and Design, U of Câ€™s MFA Program in Public Art & Curatorial Studies, Levitt Pavillion, A+D Museum, Art Center College of Design, the Armory and OMG!





Partnership and collaboration are key to each of HOLAâ€™s programs and HOLA continues to develop strong partners to help successfully carry out its mission to provide exceptional programs to the atrisk and underserved youth of LA. Through bestinclass partnerships with the Department of Recreation and Parks, the LA Philharmonic Association, LA Housing Partnership and the LA Lakers, HOLA is setting the standard for utilizing strong collaboration to build exceptional programs and services in underresourced communities.","HOLA places a significant value on program evaluation, using quantitative and qualitative methods to track the academic and personal progress of participants as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. Program directors are responsible for the evaluation of each of the components of their programs on a quarterly basis  demographic, academic, economic and qualitative data is collected. HOLA also measures the emotional and mental health of the most atrisk students through assessments provided by HOLAâ€™s counseling team who works with program directors and staff to assess needs, tracks progress and provides helpful feedback on how to best support each student. Through specific evaluation measures administered in a nurturing environment, HOLA staff witnesses improvement in academics followed by transformation in quality of life from hopeful to confident and betterprepared young adults. 





One of the most important measures HOLA tracks over time is the number of students who successfully graduate from HOLA and how many return to HOLA to give back to this community. Beginning in elementary school, HOLA fosters an incredible environment in which students feel welcomed, challenged, heard and invested in. Through HOLA, students are finding a safe place to learn, aspire and escape the generational cycle of poverty and crime. HOLA is a family  a haven for those seeking a nucleus in which to belong. Because of this, HOLA has been able to maintain a 93% college retention rate of its current alumni and most of these eagerly return to HOLA to invest in and give back to the community that has given them so much. In fact, HOLA currently has eleven alumni on staff, including the Middle School Director and several program coordinators, as well as dozens of interns and volunteers who consistently give back while home from college. HOLA considers this one of the most significant indicators of longterm program impact and effectiveness.","Residing in the culturally rich, but economically struggling Rampart District, HOLA serves youth in one of the most densely populated areas in LA County, with over 75,000 residents within a 1.75mile radius, 28% of which are under the age of 18. Latinos comprise the largest ethnic group in the community at 63% followed by Asian Americans at 26%. Of the families that HOLA serves, 90% are living at or below the poverty line and struggle each day to simply survive. As a result of these poverty levels and the dense and diverse population, this district is home to heavy violence, drug trafficking and over 30 active gangs that begin recruiting youth as young as 10 years of age. According to a LA Times report, during a recent 6month period, 488 violent crimes were reported in HOLAâ€™s neighborhood alone.





This atrisk environment is compounded by severe school budget cuts that have resulted in fewer critical services being offered to families in dire need. Students are attending overcrowded and understaffed schools that are unable to provide the individual support each student needs to successfully pursue their education. Many schoolsâ€™ arts education programs have been devastated by the state and local budgetary crisis and unfortunately, â€œmost of this decline in access has been concentrated in schools serving lowincome students, the very population that can benefit most from quality arts instruction.â€ The National Endowment for the Arts reports that arts education for Latino and AfricanAmerican students has declined by over 40% in the last twenty years. HOLA provides a rigorous arts program for youth right in the center of this impoverished neighborhood. 





Access to arts education is a critical need for underserved students across LA. Engagement in the arts has proven to bolster academic achievement, supporting HOLAâ€™s longterm aim to help all of its youth graduate high school and matriculate through college. As creative industries are the second largest business sector in LA, arts education is crucial in developing 21st century workforce skills. 





HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts is not simply an arts education supplement, but a structured and immersive program offering rigorous instruction, cultural field trips, guest artist workshops, and a firm reach into the larger LA community. Through initiatives like the Public Art Project, HOLAâ€™s students, leading LA artists and community members are connected in new and meaningful ways. The Visual Arts program is operating at capacity, with a lengthy waiting list, but carries the potential to impact even more than HOLAâ€™s 2,500 atrisk youth and their families, and to activate and create dialogue in parts of the city previously lacking access to the arts.","Art is in a constant state of discovery and experimentation, and the vision for HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts program in 2050 reflects that. HOLA will continue teaching classic technique and art history, but will also strive to encompass yet unfathomable forms and directions. Over the last few years the Visual Arts program has added new classes such as public art, studio art, video, digital photography, performance and new media with the goal of constantly embracing contemporary themes and continuing to work with emerging and established artists. Each year, HOLA will continue to offer free classes, cultivate more cultural and artistic partnerships, expand its residency programs, create more public art installations and connect Los Angeles artists to the vibrant and culturally diverse community HOLA has already been part of for decades.





By 2050, HOLA will have an alumni network that spans 61 years of service. The alumni now benefiting from Visual Arts and the Public Art Project will be in their 50â€™s and 60â€™s, and with the demonstrated commitment of alumni returning to HOLA and giving back to their community, it is easy to anticipate that these young artists may be board members, staff and volunteers. They will all be creative thinkers, problem solvers and will have a great appreciation for the arts and civic engagement. The Public Art Project is actively creating a community of arts supporters.





The comprehensive support that each HOLA youth is receiving today helps them to attain longterm academic success, emotional development and commitment to revitalizing and supporting their community. It is HOLAâ€™s aim to support each of these students in matriculating through college, and each year sees an even larger graduating class. If HOLAâ€™s graduating class increases by only ten new students each year, by 2050 HOLAâ€™s tracked alumni network will have expanded to 9,460, and we anticipate that this number will actually be exponentially higher. These youth are poised to be passionate and dedicated leaders; one member of HOLAâ€™s Class of 2010 has already volunteered and interned in support of several Los Angeles politicians, and is actively working to establish the first Young Latino Democrats group in Los Angeles! HOLA looks forward to seeing incredible change affected by and in this community by 2050."
3102114,2013114,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LightingForLAParks.html,STATE OF THE ART LIGHTING FOR CITY PARKS!, Public Safety,"Hive Lighting proposes to install new state of the art lighting at an existing field or recreation center (soccer, baseball, playground, basketball, etc.) in the City of Los Angeles.  This installation will greatly add to the safety and utilization of an existing neighborhood park. This new lighting will also allow communities, largely with no access to clean technology, the ability to participate and learn about the importance of environmental quality and human impact.  Hive aims to improve the quality of lighting in the park, and make it cost effective to keep the park open longer, allowing for greater and more varied use by the community.  





Hiveâ€™s focus is to improve a park in an underserved, low income neighborhood, with a disproportionate incidence of violent crimes, where better lighting, more park access and increased after school activities can make a significant difference in the public safety of the community.   We are especially interested in working with a park in the Summer Light Nights program in the City of Los Angeles.  We will work with local partners like area churches, schools, neighborhood associations, and the business community to identify the park where Hive will install lights. â€œAngelenos who feel that they can work with family, friends, and neighbors to bring about positive, collective change are also more likely to report feeling safer.â€ (LA2050 Report page 34)








Saving Costs, Means Saving Parks and Saving Lives: 


Hiveâ€™s lights use 50% of the power of the current lighting being used in parks, our bulbs last 10X longer than existing bulbs and they provide a higher quality of light that looks more like natural daylight.   Los Angeles parks are feeling the budget tightening that has resulted from the economic downturn.  Los Angeles already has some of the worst park access of any major US city.   With only 33% of children in the city living within a quarter mile of a park, Los Angeles canâ€™t afford to lose any of its parks or access hours.  The City of Los Angeles already knows this and at great expense has run a very successful antigang program called Summer Night Lights to provide park access and activities during the hours associated with peak gang related activities.  The program has seen a 57% reduction in gang homicides in participating areas.  To prevent parks from having to close and operate with reduced hours, the City of LA needs all the costs savings it can find.  Hiveâ€™s plasma lights will decrease the electrical bill for the park by 50%.   Hiveâ€™s lights will also require bulb replacements roughly every 7 â€“ 12 years as opposed to current lighting that often require replacement yearly.  This means that maintenance, labor and electrical costs can be significantly reduced allowing for resources to be shifted to other park needs.  Hiveâ€™s project will help expand the parks system as part of Los Angelesâ€™ ongoing 50 Parks Initiative and increase hours of operation so that existing parks can serve even more of the community.  





Quality of Light Affects Safety:  


Hiveâ€™s plasma lighting is designed to be a solar simulator; this means that the new lighting will more closely match daylight.  It may seem intuitive but more crime takes place in the dark at night.   A 2012 Stanford study found that â€œresults provide suggestive evidence that, by increasing ambient lighting, regions may be able to decrease street crimeâ€ and â€œrobbery, and violent street crime, decreases by approximately 51%... in the hour where the amount of light increases.â€ Fields lit with Hive lights will feel more like real daylight and will have a positive effect on the behavior of the individuals in the park after sunset, and increase the communityâ€™s sense of security.





More Activities Mean Less Crime:  


Adding Hiveâ€™s plasma lighting to a park means that LA can take advantage of Los Angelesâ€™ climate to provide yearround outdoor activities to our communities.  This is especially true in the hours after school and in the evening when increased park access can have the greatest effect on young people in the community.  A 2004 study of Californiaâ€™s after school programs â€œin 12 highrisk California communities found that, compared to when they started the program, crime and delinquencyrelated behavior among participants declined significantly after students completed the program. Vandalism and stealing dropped by twothirds, violent acts and carrying a concealed weapon fell by more than half, and arrests and being picked up by the police were cut in half.â€  If the hours of operation for parks and community centers can be increased with lights that are less expensive, park access and park activities can be increased.  This will give more of our young people the opportunity to get involved in positive after school activities, and will decrease gang involvement, drug and alcohol abuse and the criminal activities associated with both.  





","Hive Lighting is a Los Angeles based specialty lighting design, manufacturing and installation company for high output energy efficient fixtures.  Hive is part of the Mayorâ€™s Los Angeles CleanTech Incubator, bringing clean technology companies to the City of Los Angeles.","Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator/Cleantech LA: LADWP, City of Los Angeles.  Hive also plans to partner directly with the Summer Night Lights Program and the 50 Parks Initiative.  Hive will also seek to work with the LAPD and the Department of Recreation and Parks to measure and evaluate the success of the project.","Success for Hive and for the project will be measured objectively.  





1)	A reduction of crime during the hours of operation in the park and in the community surrounding the park.


2)	Working with City of Los Angelesâ€™ Recreation and Parks department as well as local community associations, schools, churches and businesses to select the park most in need of lighting of this nature.


3)	Completion of the installation of Hiveâ€™s state of the art, energy efficient lighting in one of Los Angelesâ€™ City Parks and Recreation Centers.


4)	Reduced operating cost for the park. Specifically success is cutting the power consumption of the lighting for the playing fields in half.  The average light being used on a playing field consumes 1,000 Watts.  Hive would install a 450 Watt plasma lamp, cutting power consumption in half, potentially saving the park over 1 Megawatt per light, per year.  On top of that are reduced maintenance costs because bulb replacements will be needed no more than once a decade, instead of every year.


5)	Improved light quality and increased access for the community during evening hours.   Documented through a survey of people using the park, the surrounding neighborhood and Dept. of Recreation and City parks employees.





Beyond these initial concrete measurements, overall success for the project will be seen in more lagging indicators.  A reduction of crime in the park overall and in the community the park is adjacent to over time and finally an increased sense of safety and security in the community.


","Our goal with this project is to inspire the use of energy efficient lighting to improve park access and park quality throughout the City of Los Angeles.  The result will be safer communities and safer public spaces.  Making parks brighter and less expensive to operate allows for increased usage by the communities that are adjacent to the parks during traditionally peak crime hours.  This also allows the parks to be used for further after school activities, which will help youth in underserved communities avoid gangs, drugs and the criminal behavior associated with both.  Los Angeles is in desperate need of more public spaces for its youth to exercise and gather in safely, and our lights make that possible.","Success in 2050 is a vibrant and safe public park system in Los Angeles, lit with low energy, high quality lighting.  Angelenos of all income levels will have access to parks and recreational activities they will have an increased sense of community because LA will have safe outdoor gathering areas for exercise, organized sports and events.  Having safe welllit epicenters throughout Los Angeles in 2050 will reduce violent crime, property crime, and gang activity, as well as increase economic and health opportunities in communities that until now were unsafe at night.  By 2050, LA will have a bright, beautiful and vibrant park system and as a result, less crime and safer communities. "
3102115,2013115,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/camphollywoodheart.html,Camp Hollywood HEART ,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Our idea is providing a second week of Hollywood HEART's innovative annual arts summer camp, Camp Hollywood HEART (CHH). CHH is a weeklong interactive arts experience for youth impacted by HIV/AIDS. Participants from ages 1521 primarily from Los Angeles have the opportunity to explore, by choice, one of seven arts disciplines: acting, creative writing, culinary arts, documentary filmmaking, fashion, music, and visual arts.  








CHH enhances human development because our youth are given the opportunity to interact positively with arts professionals and one another as they explore their creativity and receive both personal and careercentered insight. Led by experienced artists and mentors, participants enjoy comprehensive instruction and training in their chosen art, steering them in the right direction for pursuing their creative passions. The camp culminates with a professionally produced live performance, empowering our young artists to showcase their creativity and artistic vision with the entire camp community. The opportunity to celebrate each otherâ€™s talents is an experience that brings smiles, pride, and confidence to the participants for years to come.








The campers also get to choose exciting elective programming such as comic book artistry, fashion design, culinary arts, stunt choreography, and photography, providing campers with a wellrounded experience beyond their initial focus. In addition to electives and focused workshops, camp provides a variety of fun, enlightening experiences ranging from the exciting talent showcases by wellknown entertainers to beach time, sports, and games. Before departing camp each participant is provided with a resource packet full of information and direction on how to further their professional development. The week at CHH allows participants to understand the responsibilities of adulthood and build selfesteem in a trusted, caring, and fun environment.


","Since its inception in 1995, Hollywood HEART hasnâ€™t stopped providing amazing programs and support staff. Hollywood HEART was initially created as Camp Pacific Heartland (CPH) in 1995, and has since welcomed more than 1,750 campers. Created by entertainment executive David Gale, the camp was founded to address the social and recreational needs of Southern California children affected by HIV/AIDS. 





Camp Pacific Heartland was held for 17 years in Malibu, California for kids aged 616 â€” providing them with opportunities to build skills, confidence, and hope. CPH allowed campers to take a break from the stress and stigma of living in a family impacted by HIV/AIDS while providing a safe, healthful environment in which these children could enjoy themselves and experience the normalcy they often lacked in their lives.





The Movie Team sought to utilize the film industry backgrounds of Hollywood HEARTâ€™s founders, board members and volunteers to give children and teens the opportunity to participate in the art of filmmaking. Through the Movie Team experience, the youths learned to write, produce, and star in their own short films. The program collaborated with local social service agencies including foster homes, community groups and Boys and Girls Clubs to produce over 70 films throughout the United States and South Africa. The model has since been integrated into Camp Hollywood HEART as well as the ongoing Educational Arts Workshops.





Our Educational Arts workshops are a condensed version of Camp Hollywood HEART and distill performing and visual arts skills into afterschool and weekendlong formats throughout Los Angeles. Collaborating with local social service agencies and community groups, these workshops continue to share industry expertise and creativity with dozens of atrisk youth across Los Angeles. The goal of the Educational Arts Workshops is to provide skill sets to groups one workshop at a time. Programs include everything from intensive writing and documentary filmmaking workshops to fashion and set design. This allows our participants ample time to absorb, practice, and sharpen skills passed on from Hollywood professionals. Being able to provide these opportunities in collaboration with volunteers and small budgets have allowed Hollywood HEART to achieve unforgettable programming. 





","Hollywood HEART is proud to be able to partner with several amazing organizations to make CHH a reality every year. These organizations include:





One Heartland


Young Variety of Southern California


CITYstage


Alternative Intervention Model


Artists In Motion


San Fernando Valley Partnership


Mobile Film Classroom


","Participants fill out qualitative and quantitative pre/mid/post surveys to gauge effectiveness and impact of the program. Volunteers, staff, and program partners also provide feedback. Our staff then measures the change in pre and postprogram answers to determine any change in attitudes over the course of the program and whether changes in attitude continue after the program is over.





End of program evaluations for both participants and program partners also ask for qualitative feedback on items such as program structure, content, what you learned, favorite/least favorite parts, and suggestions for the future. We use this feedback to help guide our future program planning. 





Reviewing participant feedback every year is very important and has helped evolve programming to ensure success for everyone involved. Some positive feedback we received about CHH was that one participant now has arts and crafts fairs on the weekends with her siblings, another received a scholarship to Northern Arizona University for film thanks in part to films she created at camp, and another now cooks with plant based foods in order to directly combat the side effects of HIV/AIDS medications. These success stories are just a few reasons CHH needs to be expanded and offered to more youth from Los Angeles. More youth need opportunities to obtain professional and personal skills that will help ensure their success. ","Our project will specifically benefit Los Angeles because it will contribute to number of artists in the city that contribute to the economy as well as the culture. Los Angeles is one of the most artistically rich cities in the world in part thanks to the Hollywood industry. With schools continually eliminating arts programs, where will Los Angeles create, develop, and maintain identity? Hollywood HEART believes by providing these opportunities for youth in Los Angeles, they will use their skills to enhance the quality of life for all Angelenos.","Success in the year 2050 regarding our indicator would vibrant and abundant. We will have touched the lives of more than a million youth through our arts programming by opening the doors to a successful future for them. Participants of Camp Hollywood HEART would then grow up to be strong, confident individuals that will want to give back to society as they are grateful for opportunities that were provided for them.  They will spread the spirit of creativity and expression to educate others about the different lives and people that make Los Angeles the best city in the world. "
3102116,2013116,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/homeboyindustries.html,Homeboy Industries: Hope Has An Address, Public Safety,"Homeboy Industries began when a concerned group of Angelenos, led by Father Gregory Boyle, asked a simple question: Can we improve the safety and health of our communities through jobs and education rather than through suppression and incarceration?


In our 25 years providing services to Angelenos impacted by gang violence, we have learned that jobs, education and support services can indeed have a direct â€“ and profound â€“ impact on public safety. We have also learned that the success of our program corresponds directly with our ability to address the root causes of violence, alienation, and fear among communities and community members who are unsafe.<br>


<br>


In this program, we propose to improve public safety through an integrated curriculum of ten classes that help end the intergenerational cycles of violence that many former gang members and recently incarcerated men and women have experienced. The classes and support groups we offer foster the personal transformation necessary for our clients to heal from their complex traumatic histories and prevent their children, families and communities from experiencing similar trauma.<br>


<br>


400 individuals attend classes each month at Homeboy Industriesâ€™ headquarters. Classes in the curriculum are led by Homeboy Industries staff, licensed mental health clinicians, and qualified volunteers. The core classes impacting public safety include:<br>


1)  Anger Management: Provides our population with tools to develop healthy coping skills, build healthy relationships, and deal with conflict in nonviolent ways.<br>


2)  Parenting: Provides parents, particularly young parents, with the skills and techniques to improve their relationships with their children and end the cycles of violence, abuse and neglect they may have experienced in their own childhood.<br>


3)  Project Fatherhood: Provides fathers an opportunity to connect with their children, play a meaningful role in their lives, and positively affect their childrenâ€™s healthy development.<br>


4)  Baby & Me: A weekly meeting for parents and their young children that provides activities to strengthen secure attachment, increase parentsâ€™ empathy for and understanding of their childrenâ€™s needs, and decrease the likelihood of abuse or neglect.<br>


5)  Leadership: A weekly class that helps participants build leadership skills, and discusses related topics of resiliency, forgiveness, characterbuilding, loss, and separation.<br>


6)  Healthy Relationships for Women: A weekly class that helps women who have been victims of domestic and/or sexual violence develop healthy and safe relationship expectations and practices.<br>


7)  Domestic Violence Intervention for Women: A weekly group meeting that addresses domestic violence, helping batterers gain the tools and selfempowerment necessary to stop family violence and develop positive coping skills.<br>


8)  Domestic Violence Intervention for Men: A courtapproved program for male batterers that teaches life skills to build healthy coping mechanisms and healthy relationships, and to encourage men to take responsibility for their acts of violence.<br>


9)  Healing Circle: A weekly meeting that provides space for reflection, empowerment, and respect while peers embrace the struggles in their lives and help each other find meaning in their past.<br>


10)  Substance Abuse: A 3phase course offering biweekly group support meetings, these classes help clients establish and maintain longterm recovery from the addictions that often influence their involvement with gangs and crime.<br>


<br>


Classes are available to trainees (men and women who are employed by Homeboy Industries in entrylevel positions either at our organizational headquarters or in our social enterprise businesses) and to community clients (people impacted by gang violence, poverty and other issues who are not currently employed by Homeboy Industries).<br>


<br>


The classes we offer complement the variety of other proven strategies we use to prevent violence and improve public safety. Homeboy Industries employs 200 trainees at all times (approximately 300 are employed throughout the year) at our organizational headquarters and our social enterprise businesses. As part of the job, trainees also:<br>


â€¢ Attend practical, educational and vocational classes to earn high school degrees or GEDs and improve their employment readiness;<br>


â€¢ Receive mental health and substance abuse treatment to address the underlying causes of their interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system;<br>


â€¢ Undergo tattoo removal procedures to eliminate the external marks of their former involvement with gangs;<br>


â€¢ Work individually with case managers and employment counselors to establish an educational and employment plan and transition successfully to outside work;<br>


â€¢ Access much needed medical services.<br>


<br>


All services are provided free of charge, and most are available to trainees and to community clients.


","Homeboy Industries has provided hope, training and support to formerly gang involved and recently incarcerated men and women for 25 years. In that time, we have become the largest, most comprehensive and most successful gang prevention, intervention and rehabilitation organization in Los Angeles â€“ if not the entire country.<br>


<br>


Currently we provide the following services free of charge each month at Homeboy Industries:<br>


â€¢ 200 men and women are employed in entrylevel positions at our headquarters and in our social enterprise businesses, and all receive case management to stay on track with employment and educational goals;<br>


â€¢ 120 trainees receive individual substance abuse and mental health counseling with licensed clinicians;<br>


â€¢ 200 trainees and community clients receive employment counseling services;<br>


â€¢ 400 trainees and community clients participate in our broad curriculum of practical, educational and vocational classes; and<br>


â€¢ 750 trainees and community clients receive tattoo removal procedures.<br>


<br>


Due to the breadth and impact of our services, Homeboy Industries was cited as a model program in a 2005 report by the CDC focusing on the ills accompanying gangs and gang violence. The report stressed that Homeboy, by focusing on intervention, serves a vital need and is instrumental in helping break the ongoing cycle of gang violence. The CDC has also endorsed job training programs as a youth violence prevention strategy. Related to, but distinct from traditional job training programs, they noted the importance of â€œsocial microenterprise,â€ as modeled by the small businesses of Homeboy.<br>


<br>


Importantly, these services are far more cost effective than incarceration. The state and county spend $150,000200,000 to incarcerate a minor for one year, and a high risk youth will cost society between $1.7 and $2.3 million over their lifetime. Likewise, incarceration of an adult for one year costs approximately $65,000. Employment and support services at Homeboy Industries, on the other hand, cost approximately $35,000 per trainee per year.<br>


<br>


Perhaps our greatest achievement to date is the unparalleled level of support we have generated among community members and the unequaled level of trust we have achieved among those seeking our services. Homeboy Industries does not conduct formal outreach to current or former gang members. Rather, as a demonstration of their commitment to personal transformation, trainees and community clients reach in to us knowing that they will get the help they need.  


","Homeboy Industries benefits from strong collaboration and volunteer support in many areas of operation. Volunteer teachers will lead weekly classes and meetings of Healing Circle and Leadership. Baby & Me classes are facilitated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an LCSW/RN, an LCSW, an educational specialist, and a volunteer with experience in early education. USC and UCLA pediatric interns and residents often donate their time for consultation on health and wellness matters. Peace Over Violence, a Los Angelesbased sexual and domestic violence center, provides our Healthy Relationships for Women class. And Project Fatherhood classes are led by Dr. Edward Berumen and Jeffrey Williams, MFTI, of the Childrenâ€™s Institute. ","Homeboy Industries has had a singular impact on Los Angelesâ€™ gang problem. Thousands of people have walked through the doors looking for a second chance. We measure our programâ€™s impact on these individuals through an intake, assessment and followup process that addresses several key domains of safety, health and wellbeing. Specifically, we ask clients to report on recidivism (number of arrests or other interactions with law enforcement), housing stability (current living situation and longevity of residence), social connectedness (level and frequency of participation in prosocial and group support activities), substance abuse (frequency of use and its impact on their wellbeing), and child custody/reunification (progress toward family reunification and/or resolution of legal custody issues).<br> 


<br>


Homeboy Industries also assesses clientsâ€™ overall progress through evaluation of: disaffiliation with gang membership and involvement; acquisition of the right attitude and skills to secure success in mainstream employment; getting and keeping a job; and acquisition of advanced education and/or skills. The senior staff meets monthly to evaluate the program and the particular trainees, successes are shared, problems are raised and solutions proposed. In addition to daily supervision, Case Managers meet individually with clients to set personal goals, offer encouragement and praise for their successes, and guidance for the areas that may need improvement. The individual trainees at Homeboyâ€™s businesses are closely monitored and evaluated on attendance, behavior and work performance on a regular basis.<br> 


<br>


UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs Professors Jorja Leap and Todd Franke are leading a fiveyear program evaluation of Homeboy Industries. The evaluation draws upon both quantitative and qualitative measures to chart individual and organizational outcomes.


After four years the following preliminary outcomes have emerged:<br>


â€¢ 70% of Homeboy trainees do not return to incarceration;<br>


â€¢ Homeboy experiences a recidivism/loss rate of 30% of its trainees; and<br>


â€¢ Of those who leave Homeboy due to incarceration, substance abuse or other reasons, 12% have returned to Homeboy.<br>


<br>


These figures are particularly significant when compared with a national retention rate of 20% to 30% for most gang/prisoner intervention and reentry programs. In California, more than 70% of young offenders will return to prison within three years; Homeboy Industries effectively flips this number on its head, demonstrating that our service model helps transform their lives and become contributing members of their communities.<br> 


<br>


Evaluators have briefed the U.S. Department of Justice, the National Institute of Justice, U.S. Congress, the California Governorâ€™s Office, Los Angeles Mayorâ€™s office, Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff, LAUSD, CDC and World Health Organization.


","With more than 1,000 gangs and an estimated 100,000 gang members, Los Angeles County is the gang capital of the world. The City of Los Angeles is spotted with large areas of concentrated poverty where many of these gangs operate and where crime levels are higher than the citywide average. Many of the clients we serve at Homeboy Industries live in neighborhoods where elevated levels of poverty and violence negatively impact public safety, public health, and perceptions of human vulnerability.<br>   


<br>


Providing our clients with productive alternatives to involvement in gangs can dramatically improve their safety and the overall wellbeing of their families and communities. Because of the transformative power education has on healing and public safety, Homeboy Industries Education and Curriculum Department adapts traditional and alternative learning strategies to better serve men and women whose lives and communities have been impacted by poverty, violence, incarceration, and separation from their families. We provide hope through education and cocreate a solid foundation based on kinship and reciprocation. By using these strategies and imbuing our clients with hope, rather than despair, we help them make safer decisions, lead healthier lives, and become assets to the safety of their communities.<br>  


<br>


This curriculum is integrated with Homeboy Industriesâ€™ comprehensive model of gang intervention services, and impacts several of the other indicators in the LA2050 challenge.<br>  


â€¢ Education: The classes we offer also help improve the educational attainment of our clients. Many who come to us without high school diplomas earn a degree or a GED with our help. Homeboy Industries also partners with Learning Works Charter High School to provide gangimpacted youth with a supportive environment in which to earn high school diplomas.<br>


â€¢ Income and Employment: We provide onthejob training to 300 people each year. Through this training, men and women who had little work experience and few job skills are able to receive training, achieve industryrecognized credentials, build resumewriting and interviewing skills, and receive support in finding jobs outside of Homeboy Industries.<br>


â€¢ Health: Homeboy Industries provides free basic medical services for clients and community members, and helps them get enrolled in health insurance plans. We also provide free mental health, substance abuse and psychiatric counseling.<br>


â€¢ Environmental Quality: Among our most successful programs is the Solar Panel Installation Training & Certification Program. Through this program, community clients receive a state and nationallyrecognized certification in a growing field that has the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of the city and their own communities.<br>


<br>


In everything we do, Homeboy Industries connects people to one another and works collectively to transform individual lives, families, and the city we call home. 


","Gangs and gang violence are the result of a nexus of complex social issues, including poverty, lack of educational opportunities, addictive and mental health disorders, scarce job opportunities, and traumatic events in the lives of gang members. To tackle this problem, we provide comprehensive wraparound services to address the clientsâ€™ needs and help them redirect their lives to become contributing members of society. Through this program, we will provide education and support that is crucial to ending the intergenerational cycles of violence that plague many poor and underserved neighborhoods across Los Angeles.<br> 


<br>


Success in the year 2050 would mean families and communities where violence, fear and vulnerability no longer predominate. Homeboy Industries presents a vision of that possible future. As our Founder, Father Gregory Boyle, writes: â€œWe are a worksite and therapeutic community. We are a training program and business. Once the homies come to feel some confidence in the workplace, they can move on to higherpaying opportunities elsewhere. Also, we give homies a chance to work with their enemies. The place has become the â€˜United Nationsâ€™ of gangs. When enemies work with one another, a valuable â€˜disconnectâ€™ is created on the streets. It forces a fellow active gang member to ask the employed homie, â€˜How can you work with that guy?â€™ Answering that question will be awkward, clumsy, and always require courage, but the question itself jostles the status quo.â€<br>


<br>


Success in the year 2050 would also mean a Los Angeles that is not a grid of neighborhoods locked in cycles of conflict and violence, but an everwidening circle of compassion and kinship â€“ â€œnot serving the other, but being one with the other.â€ To quote Father Boyle again, â€œWe imagine no one standing outside of that circle, moving ourselves closer to the margins so that the margins themselves will be erased. We stand there with those whose dignity has been denied. We locate ourselves with the poor and the powerless and the voiceless. At the edges, we join the easily despised and the readily left out. We stand with the demonized so that the demonizing will stop. We situate ourselves right next to the disposable so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away.â€<br>


<br>


If we jostle the status quo for long enough, if we move ourselves to the margins, if we stand with the demonized and the powerless and voiceless, then we can redefine our communities as places where hope, compassion and kinship predominate, and where families feel safe and secure.

3102117,2013117,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/HoneyLove.html,PesticideFree Los Angeles 2050, Environmental Quality,"Since 2006, more than onethird of honey bee colonies have collapsed worldwideâ€”a global phenomenon now called Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD. There is no one smoking gun causing CCD; in fact, scientists now widely agree that it is a combination of factors. The best science tells us that if present trends continue there will be no more bees by 2035. That is, if we fail to actâ€”if we fail to recognize this disaster in the making and don't take strong action to counter the slow march to extinction. <br><br>





At HoneyLove we have made it our mission to inspire and educate urban beekeepers as a means of conserving this critical species. Whereas bees used for pollination in the migratory beekeeping industry are suffering from colony collapse disorder, bees living in urban environmentsâ€”especially Los Angelesâ€”have been spared this fate. Why? Because the reasons contributing to the decline of the honey bee are absent (or significantly reduced) in the city environment. Urban bees can find more than enough forage in our gardens, landscaping, and weedy areas to feed themselves throughout the seasons (commercial bees are fed an artificial diet of sugar water, confectionery sugar and high fructose corn syrup). Because there is plentiful forage, urban bees are spared the stress which has contributed to the species' vulnerability. And since the vast majority of the forage in the city is pesticidefreeâ€”because most homeowners aren't dumping industrialstrength chemicals on their yardsâ€”bees have one less critical enemy to contend with. While the city represents the bees' best shot at surviving and thriving, at HoneyLove still have a lot of work to do to ensure they will have a healthy ecosystem in the future. <br><br>





In spite of being relatively pesticidefree compared to big agriculture, Los Angeles still uses an alarming amount of consumerlevel pesticides that pollute our soil and waterways and affect our already poor air quality. Consumer products are often harmful to pollinators like the honey bee and yet they do not have to be labeled as such. HoneyLove's vision for 2050 is of a pesticidefree Los Angeles, achieved through grassroots campaigning and led by beekeepers in each of LA's 95 communities. We believe that by creating educated urban beekeepers we're also creating stakeholders in our communities who can represent our concerns about pesticides. It is our belief that by training and educating beekeepers as ambassadors of the pesticidefree Los Angeles message, we can begin to tackle this enormous problem one household at a time, one lawn at a time, one school at a time, until we've built a critical mass which will simply not accept the use of chemicals in our backyards, parks, and public spaces. Taking pesticides out of the equation will have unquestionable benefits for our environment; soil will be free of chemical contaminants, runoff after storms will lack the poisonous punch it once had, and citizens will breathe freely knowing they won't be inhaling carcinogenic toxins. The only indicator a pesticidefree LA in 2050 doesn't touch on is proximity to parks and access to free space, but it does ensure that those places will be cleaner, healthier environments for people to enjoy. Our parks can become shining examples of pesticidefree, natural environments and serve as the inspiration for citizens to think differently about the products they use at home and in their gardens.","Since being founded in April 2011, HoneyLove has been leading the grassroots effort to legalize urban beekeeping in Los Angeles, beginning with an extensive feasibility study and outreach campaign in Mar Vista. From there we gained the additional support of 10 Neighborhood Councils throughout Los Angeles: Del Rey, Greater Griffith Park, South Robertson, Silver Lake, Hollywood United, Atwater Village, West LA, Boyle Heights, Lake Balboa, and Chatsworth. Our thorough campaign work resulted in Councilman Bill Rosendahl putting our motion before the Los Angeles City Council where it is currently being studied by the Planning and Land Use Committee. And while we can't say that we have achieved full legalization yet, in creating the community model and approaching it from a grassroots level we've created momentum which cannot be stopped. <br><br>





Our most important achievements are not measured in legislative changes but in the number of people we reach, teach, and impact. In that respect we have been enormously successful. In a short time we've connected with people all over the world through monthly workshops, mentoring sessions, honey bee rescues, education outreach, neighborhood council involvement and social media connections. Our proudest single achievement is creating a global community of conscientious, active urban beekeepers who now share HoneyLove's mission with an evergrowing audience. In 2050, we hope to look back on our work and be proud to say that we helped lead the change toward a pesticidefree Los Angeles.    ","HoneyLove's success can be attributed to our eagerness to partner with other local orgs and community groups. In addition to working with other beekeeping clubs, we'll collaborate with groups like Surf Rider's Ocean Friendly Gardens, Tree People, and LA Green Grounds. In order to bring LA up to speed with other great cities around the world, we will build on the work of Capital Bee, Pesticide Action Network, Beyond Pesticides, Pollinator Partnership, Xerces Society, and more. We intend to work at the community level so we'll actively seek partnership with each of LA's 95 community councils. Our strategy is to create advocates (beekeepers) in each community so our true partners are the individuals advancing the cause on a hyperlocal level.","As we've learned through our legalization efforts, you can't just take on all of Los Angeles all at once; it works much better if you build your case community by community. Since the first step of our PesticideFree Los Angeles campaign is to target the use of pesticides on city and county property, we'll start by approaching community councils to gain support for our motion to suspend citysponsored pesticide applications in parks, medians, and other public properties. The metrics for success are fairly straightforward: we can gauge progress by the number of councils reached and where our motion stands in the Los Angeles City Council legislative agenda. <br><br>





Another benchmark we'll strive for is the creation and training of beekeeper ambassadors in each of Los Angeles' communities. We will evaluate our success on the basis of having a representative in each community who can persuasively make the case why Los Angeles must rid itself of pesticides. <br><br>





The third piece of our campaign is to create an educational curriculum about pesticides we can share through our school outreach, workshops, and marketing materials. These opportunities will provide the feedback we'll need to constantly evaluate the efficacy of our materials. It will require us to continuously refine our approach, and tailor it to the various audiences and demographics. <br><br>





The effects of our projectâ€”cleaner soil, air, and waterâ€”will be very difficult to measure, but the progress toward freeing Los Angeles of pesticides will be evaluated by asking ourselves the simple question, ""do people still use pesticides?"" If the answer is anything but ""no,"" we haven't yet reached our goal. ","The conventional wisdom is that Los Angeles is polluted, smoggy and utterly beyond repair. Residents who don't know anything else succumb to apathy and do little to invest in the quality of their local environment. Beyond helping to create a healthier ecosystem (air, water and soil quality), we believe that PesticideFree Los Angeles will elicit an enduring investment in the local environment from a significant and meaningful number of the city's denizens. People are always shockedâ€”then pleasantly surprisedâ€”to learn that the city is the last, best hope for the survival of the honey bee. A HoneyLove project will educate, enlighten and inspire the hearts and minds of current and future residents of Los Angeles and as a result will garner the magnitude of investment we need to reduce pollutants and restore the health of our communities. Our project's most tangible offering to the Los Angeles community will be a mobile app that allows users to track the use of pesticides in public spaces, and receive a score card for how their local park, green space, or high school sports field is performing. ","The year is 2050 and Los Angeles has fundamentally, beautifully transformed; has successfully reinvented herself like so many Hollywood starlets throughout our city's history. Bursting with rooftop gardens downtown, raised beds that feed entire families and sustainable suburbs alive with native plants, there is not a useless grass lawn in sight. Los Angeles has morphed from the consumer/commuter culture of yesteryear into a hyperlocal, walkable, sustainable, responsible city with a healthy future. Not only has Los Angeles undergone a physical transformation from a concrete jungle to a localfoodproducing haven, it has also taken on a new cultural personality. Shedding their former consumer identities, Angelenos now think of themselves as producers capable of growing their own food and providing for themselves. Residents of Los Angeles have become fiercely protective of their local environment and are proud of the fact their city was the first to be 100% pesticidefree. Honey bees and beekeepers have become symbols of this newfound identity, representing the catalyst that was needed to forge the new Los Angeles. Our city will have become the gold standard for living alongside honey bees and we will be globally renowned for our bountiful honey harvests. And rather than being cast as killers and pests, honey bees will be returned to their rightful role at the very center of our existence."

What if artists had more customized support and were able to explore new ways to get their projects made and participate in creating media that mattered?</p>





<p>Imagine a collaborative community anchored by a physical gathering place in Los Angeles which brings visual artists together with social entrepreneurs to create meaningful change. A place that equips artists and creative professionals with the enterprising tools needed to create their work and sustain themselves. A place that is home to a diverse community that:</p>





<p>Brings forth disruptive new ideas and technologies


Changes distribution dramatically


Redefines a service and product


Focuses the disorganized and connects the disconnecte


Challenges the infrastructure, changes the rules and the flow of information


Democratizes access and directs gains to the creator


Honors the individual AND the community


Takes the lead on new ethics, a new business model that cares for not just profit but also people and the planet</p>





<p>That place and community exists now.</p>





<p>Hub LA opened in September 2012 as a new kind of gathering place in the Arts District in Downtown LA.  With near 200 members and growing, Hub LA uses collaborative consumption and communitysourcing to provide the space, resources, and relationships individuals and teams need to launch and scale their projects.  It is the place for professionals of all disciplines who are dedicated to making a better world and cocreating our new economy. To accomplish this vision, we know we must design a place that includes artists and creative professionals, and amplify the role of arts and culture in building a more just economy.</p>





<p>After being open six months, we are launching a Media Lab that will be a physical resource of 3200 square feet with additional programming for media makers, storytellers, and visual artists of all kinds because we believe building this kind of infrastructure and institution will do three key things to spur innovation in the arts and culture sector in a way we havenâ€™t seen before.</p>





<p>1) Social good startups will have access to cutting edge talent to tell the stories that set these new companies apart. These stories are critical for social entrepreneurs to attract capital and tap into loyal customers looking to buy from sustainable, prosocial brands;</p>





<p>2) Artists will have access to entrepreneurial energy and startup resources along side ongoing critique from a curated community of peers. Equipping artists and creative professionals with the business acumen and tools to produce their own work will allow more people to make a viable living from their creative pursuits; and</p>





<p>3) Be a home for the disruptive companies that are leading the way towards a â€œNew Hollywood.â€ Startups that are democratizing access to production, distribution, and funding; collectives of creative professionals launching new design businesses; and storytellers who are creating meaningful, different, yet entertaining work: we want this to be your headquarters.</p>





<p>Hub LAâ€™s Media Lab aims to build a world in which artists and social entrepreneurs collaborate and combine storytelling with new media to create social change and in turn provide entrepreneurial tools for artists to sustain themselves.</p>





<p>Anchored by a physical space equipped with the necessary technical equipment for multimedia creation, the Media Lab will:</p>





<p>Make new media equipment accessible, thereby attracting local independent artists in need of affordable professional facilities;</p>





<p>Cultivate a talent pool of modern artists through programs built around design thinking, data visualization, and brandbuilding; and</p>





<p>Develop new mediums and channels for content distribution through partnerships with content distributors in the multimedia industries; and</p>





<p>Provide the enterprising training and new models of collaborative funding that will lead to a more sustainable arts and culture sector in Los Angeles.</p>








<p>Our Media Lab will serve as a platform for connecting storytellers, photographers, videographers, designers, programmers, visual artists, and social entrepreneurs in a media facility fully equipped with preproduction, production, and postproduction equipment. This space will benefit the creation, dissemination, and support of LAâ€™s next generation creative artists and provide a new model thatâ€™s part institution, part campus, and part innovation lab to spur Arts and Culture in Los Angeles.</p>","<p>Hub LA has building the social enterprise community in Los Angeles since 2009 and had a physical gathering place since September 2012.  Since then we have built a community of 175 members...and growing!</p>





<p>These members fall across 12 Change Sectors including: Art and Design, Clean Tech/Renewable Energy, Community Development, Education, Environmental Sustainability, Impact Investing, International Development, Local Food, Media and Entertainment, Public Health and Tech Services for Change; Roughly 70% of members categorizing themselves as social entrepreneurs; the largest sector represented is Media and Entertainment followed by Community Development and Education.</p>





<p>We have constructed and created 4500 square feet of creative work, meeting, and event space.</p>





<p>We have built out an additional 3200 square feet to create the Media Lab</p>


    


<p>Sponsorship and partnership of over 50 events to date supporting organizations such as GOOD, Acumen Fund, AIGA, Praxis Labs, Dell Womenâ€™s Network for Entrepreneurship, Green Festival, Social Justice Institute to name a few.</p>","<p>Hub Los Angeles, since opening in 2012 has partnered and collaborated with over 30 organizations from media and entertainment to civic, tech, education and importantly, social enterprise. Our near 200member community in LA as well as the 10,000+ Hub members around the world serves as a spine of support as we build the Media Lab programming & community.</p>


<p>As of this date, the Media Lab has official support with partners from Film Independent, Los Angeles Film Festival, KUSC, SciArc, AIGA, Taproot Foundation, LA Opera & professionals/mentors to help build programming, events & residencies from CAA, Universal Pictures, NBC Universal, Focus Features, Media Rights Capital, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox Studios, Sony Motion</p>","<p>First and foremost, success for the Media Lab will be measured by the number and quality of members that we will build in this burgeoning community. We are successful if we can attract a crossdisciplinary group of creative professionals who are dedicated to creating content that sits at the intersection of message and meaning.  Media Lab success will be determined by:</p>





<p>Finding Media professionals looking to bring their expertise to new projects that make a difference and operate outside the traditional â€˜studio systemâ€™</p>





<p>Creating a community of Content Creators, and Pro Amateurs unable to complete their work because they lack access to affordable technical facilities and likeminded community.</p>





<p>Anyone looking to gain, and share, multimedia skills through training and educational programs. Our members will be accomplished, and will have both something to offer and to learn from the community.</p>





<p>Graduate 10 members/year from Hub LA Media Lab Media Acclerator Program</p>





<p>Contribute to Diversity Programs across town including: Project Involve, Sundance Labs, Fox Diversity Program, Universal Pictures Diversity Writers Program, Disney Writing Programs, USC and UCLA Film School programs, Tribeca Film Festival Social Innovators</p>





<p>By 2014, create programming, labs and events for community outreach to look and foster diverse talent and content creators looking to create media for social change.</p>





<p>By 2014, all Media Lab members will have participated in mentorship programs, office hours, business acceleration services seeded through Hub LA.</p>





<p>By 2014, create an ArtistinResidence program dedicated to building a library of data visualizations and furthering how digital artists can help foster social innovation; specific focus on education and environmental justice.</p>





<p> Monthly events/salons/panels to discuss future of media, disruption, community values and create a safe harbour for new innovation, white papers, discussion and collaboration to grow.</p>





<p>By 2014, Hub LA will pilot a prosocial production company model beginning in fall 2013 that will identify and seek out opportunities to produce meaningful projects across a widerange of disciplines including:</p>





<p>Advocacy Campaigns/PSAs


TV, Film, Scripts, Literary Arts


Digital Art, Performance Art, and Data Visualization</p>








<p>By 2015, we will have created a measurably diverse community of 300 Media Lab members comprised of a number of individuals, startups, and growth organizations/companies who share a common value of creating positive social and environmental change in the world through contentcreation.</p>





<p>By 2015, 75% of Hub Media Lab members will be contributing to the â€impact economyâ€ of Los Angeles through all manners of media, adding to arts and culture first through LA and then spreading globally.</p>","The Hub LA Media Lab provides solutions based on these three core assumptions:





Meaningful storytelling creates change.  Stories connect people. Storytelling is the single most powerful way to move people towards empathy and action. For a social entrepreneur, storytelling expresses the â€œwhyâ€ and sets a brand apart in the marketplace, expanding  impact, audience, and reach.





Topdown Hollywood Studio model is becoming less relevant.  Audiences are hungry for meaningful, authentic stories and original content. Studios are designed to prioritize the bottom line over content, reducing all projects to profit maximizing endeavors.





New disruptive models are changing the entertainment industry.  Whether it is more accessible technology to create content or new platforms to distribute and consume media, the entertainment industry and the studio model is in flux. New distribution models and ideas will soon need to be embraced.





IDENTIFIED NEED:


After surveying a significant sample of LAâ€™s multimedia professionals, weâ€™ve found three critical roadblocks impeding them from attaining their full potential:





High costs associated with production & postproduction facilities


Limited access to talented collaborators for feedback & peer review


Difficulty reaching appropriate distribution channels 





MEDIA LAB SOLUTION


Anchored by a physical space with the needed technical equipment to create multimedia and visual arts projects, and hosting a community of independent artists and social entrepreneurs, the Media Lab space will be a new beacon for the Arts and Culture sector and allow Angelenos to:





    Access professional facilities and equipment as well as a dedicated community diverse enough to provide for all talent required when producing a project;





    Expand the impact of the social entrepreneurs and changemakers through visual media and storytelling resources and thereby amplify Los Angeles creative and social good sectors, thus attracting new talent from around the world;





    Explore how the artists and professional content creators, when connected with social entrepreneurs and sociallyminded investors, gain the skills needed to sustain themselves and accelerate the creation and dissemination of their own projects; and





    Through the Global Hub Network, connect with new national and global models of collaborative funding and legal structures being tested such as Seed and Spark and TrustArt that spur arts and culture. 





Media Programs will include:


ArtistinResident program dedicated to building a library of data visualizations and furthering how digital artists can help foster social innovation; specific focus on education and environmental justice.





    Diversity Programing that include mentorship from across town including: Project Involve, Sundance Labs, Fox Diversity Program, Universal Pictures Diversity Writers Program, Disney Writing Programs, USC and UCLA Film School programs, Tribeca Film Festival Social Innovators





    ","  <p>By 2050, Hub LA Media Lab will be an anchor institution within the Arts and Culture sector and be the place Angelenos look to for social innovation in Los Angeles.  By 2050, Hub LA Media Lab will be true to its name by being a hub that:</p>





  <p>    Enables individuals with projects and startup teams to tell their stories and promote their brand/product through digital media</p>

3102119,2013119,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/hrlaartresidency.html,Human Resources L.A. Artist Residency Program!,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Human Resources L.A. Artist Residency Program would create Los Angeles' first centrally focused artist residency to hosts L.A. based artists and actively work to support their surrounding communities. Although there are several Artist residencies currently in place that support international artist in L.A. there is yet to be a program that serves L.A. locally. 





By hosting 6 artists in the coming year Human Resources L.A. (HRLA) would act as a frame for a diverse set of vital yet under supported artist practices already occurring in Los Angeles. Each artist would be given studio space, a stipend and be asked to contribute to a public program that engages the city of Los Angeles. The residency would promote exchange between these cooccurring artist practices as well as foster educational and community impact; contextualizing the work in a noncommercial environment in order to bring global attention to the city of Los Angels as an international arena for culture and the arts. 





Our goal in supporting our residents would be to create an exceptional environment in which to further personal practices while engaging them in HRLAâ€™s existing community and beyond. Community outreach will be activated by facilitating exhibition, performance, publication and symposium inside our existing Chinatown gallery space and institutional frame as well as activating our partners â€“ including major institutions, galleries and fellow artistrun spaces. 





Part of our effort would be to extend geographical bridges between the artist communities established on the west side of L.A. in the last 25 years â€“ Santa Monica, Venice beach, Culver City â€“ and the new migrations east â€“ Chinatown artist run space already in close collaboration with HRLA including KChung Radio, Ooga Booga, Machine Projects in Echo Park, Night Gallery. 








","HRLA was a collaborator and grant receiver of Getty Museum for PST festival 2012, We have collaborated with REDCAT Gallery, UC Riverside, CalArts, LAND, Machine Projects on cooperative programs. Human Resources is a team of creative individuals, whose mission is to broaden public engagement with contemporary and conceptual art. Our organization emphasizes underexposed modes of expression and interdisciplinary arts practices that do not fit easily within existing institutionalized structures.





Human Resources was identified by the Los Angeles Weekly in 2012 as one of the city's ""most dynamic arts venues."" We foster active public appreciation of performative, participatory and multidisciplinary art practices by encouraging maximum community access. Events are free or very low cost. Members of our broad community generate exhibitions, performances and readings  artists who attend our events are encouraged to bring proposals to directing members. Our programming procedures encourage direct conversation with artists, musicians and writers in order to educate our audiences about our mission. These conversations also shape our understanding of the needs of artists working in noncommercial and experimental paradigms. 





Human Resources serves as an important point of convergence for diverse and sometimes disparate art communities. We offer regular platforms for conversation and ideasharing in order to promote the sustainability of nontraditional art forms. We nurture the kinds of artistic intelligence produced by working closely with different artistic communities  such as that of experimental music and performance art. We have also collaborated with other art spaces and events, including Pacific Standard Time, Silvershed's Collective show, fundraisers and events for Les Figues Press and Darin Klein's Box of Books, and the Chinatown Perform!Now! Festival.  We continue to provide a substantial venue for large events, installations, video screenings, music performance, performance art and hybrid events in the Chinatown area of Los Angeles. 





","18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica is a nonprofit 25 yearold artist residency program that hosts over 30 international artists annually and 20 mid and long term local artist residents. 18th Street Arts Center would act as our mentor through consultation, collaborative exchanges and joint staffing. We would look to 18th Street and Santa Monica Cityâ€™s support of this institution as a model to build from. ","We will hold extensive interviews with each artist in residence at the end of their stay and create documents that evaluate their experience. We will collect data addressing the impact of events, exhibitions and publications  all programs currently implemented by Human Resources L.A.â€™s existing infrastructure  that will be available platforms for Artists in Residence to engage. Current systems of collecting data addressing viewership, visitors, community impact, marketing, education and outreach will be applied towards the residency at the end of the grant cycle and complied into a responsive document of accountability. ","While Los Angels is designated a thriving global art market it is now just approaching designation as a global arts city. Recently initiated endeavors including PST 2012, the first L.A. Biennial at Hammer Museum and upcoming PST 2017 are placing Los Angeles as a powerful center for culture and the arts on the international stage. A  artist residency, which surprisingly Los Angeles does not yet have, would act as an important platform to support generation of high caliber artist works, discourse and exchange. This residency could grow to support a cross section of arts institutions within Los Angeles and artists working within them through concerted participation. 





Through our participation with 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, Southern Californiaâ€™s largest artist residency program, we would hope to create public art works that tie together the larger geographical landscape of Los Angeles. In December 2015 the L.A. City Metro is scheduled to open itâ€™s Bergamont Station and 17th Street Stations completing a long awaited thoroughfare connecting central Los Angeles to the west side. 18th Street is an early partner with Metro to select public arts commissions designated for these new transit sites. Meanwhile, HRLA is only blocks away form the existing Chinatown station. Both institutions would like to partner to implement a public arts program in collaborated effort with Metro in the future. Our focus would be to engage the ridership of Metro and support artistsâ€™ projects that address the unique geographical web that is Los Angeles.





These geographical bridges would parallel generational bridges and serve to elaborate upon the rich history of 18th Street Arts Center and itâ€™s support of an older generation of west side artists by creating platforms for exchange between the two residencies. Both 18th Street and HRLA have existing exhibition venues and publication presidents that can support the public extension of work produced from these exchanges.





The core immediate audience and community for Human Resources are artists and art appreciators living on the east side of Los Angeles. This community is diverse in terms of age, race, gender and socioeconomic status with community members ranging from the early20s to their mid60s. The Artist residency program would allow us to continue to grow this community and extend it further out into the public sphere.","HRLA has a dream of Los Angeles in 2050 as a global arts city, a pioneer and center for innovative crosspollination of creative thought. Artist residencies provide environments for artist to flourish not only in their private practice but also in unexpected conversation with the larger community. Artist residencies become active breeding grounds for experimental practices, educational outreach and exchange. Any established global arts city must competitively foster a vital artist residency program that facilitates the production and practice of crucial working artists first locally and then beyond as it promote its cultural production abroad. HRLA Artist Residency Program would work towards creating supported space for creative thinking, action and education with the mission to prove that art, creativity, critical discourse and cooperation promotes a higher quality of life and engaging of mind for all members of a society.

Not only does this help to uplift a struggling neighborhood, but it creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles â€“ by creating a larger pool of talent coming from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. ****** Our startup incubator program will provide the following to East LA communities: ****** EDUCATION: Provide classes in entrepreneurship (such as how to formulate a business plan, how to pitch a VC, how to use social media, legal and accounting seminars etc) and relevant tech skills such as coding, web development, UX design, graphic design and more. 








****** MENTORSHIP:  Provide a forum for mentorship between local aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced business experts. Our team is wellconnected to the LA tech, entertainment, and investment communities, which will provide an endless source of mentorship. 








****** PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING:  We hope to create a network of skilled professionals who are capable of joining or creating jobs in tech and startups.  We will provide a platform for networking with each other, and with tech companies and startups from all over LA. 








****** WORK SPACE: Provide coworking/office space at low cost to locallyfocused startups. Our facility will be the historic Casa Del Mexicano building in Boyle Heights, East LA.  The i.am.angel Foundation is currently renovating the building to turn it into a stateoftheart community center, which will also house other programs in STEM and Arts education. It will be a perfect space for the crosspollination of ideas that leads to innovation!








****** CAPITAL: Provide seed funding for startups that fit certain criteria, such as startups that are focused locally on the East LA community, or startups that promote social good.  By the end of 2013, we hope to identify and support 5 local startups in East LA with $10,000 each in seed funding. 


","The i.am.angel Foundation seeks to transform lives through education, opportunity and inspiration.  We have spearheaded several programs that are transforming lives in East LA, particularly the Boyle Heights community. Here are our biggest and most successful programs: ****** i.am College Track ****** College Track is a national educational organization that empowers students from underserved communities to reach their dreams of a college degree. College Track actively engages students over the course of eight years, from the summer before high school through college graduation. 100% of College Track seniors graduate from high school, more than 90% are admitted to a fouryear university, and 75% of College Track students are currently enrolled, or have graduated from, college. Over 85% of College Track students will be the first person in their family to earn a college degree.  The i.am College Track program serves 50 ambitious new students from Roosevelt High School every year, and continues to work with them over an 8 year cycle. ****** i.am Home ****** In 2010, during the height of the foreclosure crisis, the i.am Home program was launched. The program works with effective partner organizations to promote financial literacy education and provide home owner assistance grants to support qualifying families in need.  To date i.am Home has provided more than $400,000 in home owner assistance grants. ****** i.am Scholarship ****** The i.am Scholarship program was launched in 2009. The program works with effective partner organizations like Oprah Winfreyâ€™s Angel Network, Scholastic America and College Track to identify qualifying students in need of financial support. i.am angel selects students with a proven record of accomplishment and gives them the opportunity to chase their dreams through scholarship.  To date the i.am Scholarship program has directly invested more than $500,000 in Americaâ€™s future.


","We will work with an education partner such as General Assembly L.A.

We will monitor socioeconomic effects on the community, looking at factors such as the creation of local businesses and jobs. 4. We will evaluate the performance of the 5 local startups chosen to receive seed funding from this program.  ","An East LA incubator project will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just the east side. Hereâ€™s WHY: 





        Our incubator program creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles, by creating a LARGER and more DIVERSE pool of entrepreneurial talent. The future needs solutions that involve EVERYONE.





        Our incubator program will foster entrepreneurship in struggling communities that are often burdened with crime, violence, and unemployment.  By providing education and opportunity, we will enable people to start successful legitimate businesses, or gain the highdemand and highpaying skills needed to work in tech, rather than doing illegal things.





This has a halo effect on so many other factors.  Not only could it boost the local economy, creating jobs for local young people, but they will also be more likely to stay in the neighborhoods and continue to improve them.  It could reduce crime and violence, and increase safety in these struggling neighborhoods and surrounding areas.  The East LA incubator program can serve as a model for other similar communities around the world.   





        Our incubator program will give seed funding, supporting the creation of startups that provide value to the local community, especially those focusing on social good. Our project could be funding the future hottest LA startups promoting arts & cultural vitality, education, environmental quality, health, housing, income & employment, public safety, and social connectedness.


","In the year 2050, the LA tech and startup communities will look a lot more like LA itself:  culturally diverse, rich in differing talent, opinions, backgrounds, and walks of life. LA will be a true breeding ground for innovation.  There will also be greater focus on companies that produce sustainable and social good.  LA will also be home to stronger communities with vibrant local economies that match the unique culture of each.  Our vision is that the i.am.angel incubator model will have hubs in various communities all over Los Angeles.

","We will work with an education partner such as General Assembly L.A. (https://generalassemb.ly/locations/losangeles), which provides a network of qualified instructors in entrepreneurship and tech skills.  The i.am.angel Foundation will make sure the classes will be affordable for the East LA communities.  We also work closely with ELACC, the East LA Community Corporation (http://www.elacc.org/), who are our partners at the Casa Del Mexicano.  They will also provide valuable outreach to the East LA community. 


","1. We will look closely at attendance of the programâ€™s classes and events.  We will survey participants of their experience, aiming for value, diversity and crosspollination.  2. We will track success stories and chronicle them in our website and other social media platforms. We will write blogs and produce video content. 3.  We will monitor socioeconomic effects on the community, looking at factors such as the creation of local businesses and jobs. 4. We will evaluate the performance of the 5 local startups chosen to receive seed funding from this program.  ","An East LA incubator project will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just the east side. Hereâ€™s WHY: 





        Our incubator program creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles, by creating a LARGER and more DIVERSE pool of entrepreneurial talent. The future needs solutions that involve EVERYONE.





        Our incubator program will foster entrepreneurship in struggling communities that are often burdened with crime, violence, and unemployment.  By providing education and opportunity, we will enable people to start successful legitimate businesses, or gain the highdemand and highpaying skills needed to work in tech, rather than doing illegal things.





This has a halo effect on so many other factors.  Not only could it boost the local economy, creating jobs for local young people, but they will also be more likely to stay in the neighborhoods and continue to improve them.  It could reduce crime and violence, and increase safety in these struggling neighborhoods and surrounding areas.  The East LA incubator program can serve as a model for other similar communities around the world.   





        Our incubator program will give seed funding, supporting the creation of startups that provide value to the local community, especially those focusing on social good. Our project could be funding the future hottest LA startups promoting arts & cultural vitality, education, environmental quality, health, housing, income & employment, public safety, and social connectedness.


","In the year 2050, the LA tech and startup communities will look a lot more like LA itself:  culturally diverse, rich in differing talent, opinions, backgrounds, and walks of life. LA will be a true breeding ground for innovation.  There will also be greater focus on companies that produce sustainable and social good.  LA will also be home to stronger communities with vibrant local economies that match the unique culture of each.  Our vision is that the i.am.angel incubator model will have hubs in various communities all over Los Angeles.

3102122,2013122,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/cainesarcade.html,The Caines Arcade Challenge, Education,"<p>10,000 children in Los Angeles will start their 2013 school year by participating in the Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge. Hosted by the Imagination Foundation and inspired by the short film, â€œCaineâ€™s Arcade,â€ this Challenge will foster creativity and celebrate the imagination of children by inviting elementary and middle schoolaged youth to design and build fun and engaging arcade games made from cardboard, recycled materials and imagination.</p>





<p>â€œCaineâ€™s Arcadeâ€ has been widely cited as one of the most inspirational stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views, trended worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans, and inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across the globe.</p>





<p>During the month of September, children participating in the Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will design and build cardboard arcades in schools all over the Southland; then on October 5th, commemorating the flashmob that came out to make Caineâ€™s day in the short film, communities will come together and play. On this day, the â€œDay of Play,â€ children will operate their arcades to raise money to support various local causes, practicing the value of social entrepreneurship. And adults will learn the simple things they can do to foster a childâ€™s creativity.</p>





<p>Though focused on Los Angeles, the Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will coincide with our Global Cardboard Challenge that will take place in 70 countries and serve 1 million children. Our first Global Cardboard Challenge was in 2012 and included a unique range of participants  from a school district in Texas to an EcoArt Park in Uganda, from Adobe Offices in San Francisco to the Warehouse Project in Sri Lanka. Kids repurposed cardboard into games, toys, robots and spaceships  whatever they could imagine. Along the way they learned about teamwork, problem solving, creativity and the value of recycling. Watch footage from last yearâ€™s Challenge at: www.imagination.is/gcc_videos.</p>





<p>The Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will provide thousands of children in Los Angeles a crash course in creativity and social entrepreneurship. 500 teachers will learn effective projectbased learning inspired by the Caineâ€™s Arcade story, and thousands of members of the Los Angeles community will come out to play at cardboard arcades built by kids.</p>





<p>During the Challenge, student participants will be part of a projectbased learning environment of unprecedented scale that inspires invention and makes leaning fun. Students will engage in a simple process that develops creativity, and along the way, they will learn: Design Thinking, Math and Financial LIteracy, Engineering, Social Entrepreneurship and the value of Recycling. Where appropriate, all content standards will be aligned to the Common Core.</p>





<p>Student learning will occur in a uniquely connected environment as children from Los Angeles will have opportunities to showcase their work along with children participating in the Global Challenge in other countries. Some classes will Skype with other classes as far away as Costa Rica, Uganda and Bali. Many of the classes participating in the Challenge will take field trips to the actual Caineâ€™s Arcade site in Boyle Heights for handson inspiration and real world connection.</p>





<p>The Challenge is designed as follows:


 A 24 week projectbased learning curriculum, conducted in the month of September, derived from the â€œCaineâ€™s Arcadeâ€ short film, and aimed at fostering creative thinking and social entrepreneurship.


 Field trips to the Caineâ€™s Arcade site in Boyle Heights to enhance the learning experience and inspire participants.


 The â€œDay of Playâ€ on October 5 when children will operate their cardboard arcades and raise money for various local causes.


 Professional development for teacher participants during August.


 A Caineâ€™s Arcade community website will showcase the Challenges, locate the arcades, and capture an expansive catalogue of content uploaded by Challenge participants.</p>





<p>About the Imagination Foundation:


The mission of the Imagination Foundation is to find, foster and fund creativity and entrepreneurship in children around the world to raise a new generation of innovators and problem solvers who have the tools they need to build the world they imagine.</p>





<p>We accomplish our mission by building a worldwide movement that celebrates imagination and fosters creativity. To fuel this movement, we produce and amplify inspirational stories of creative children, orchestrate largescale events, campaigns and challenges, and grow an ecosystem of rich content to equip teachers, parents and communities everywhere with the tools and knowledge they need to develop child creativity.</p>","<p>On the last day of summer, through a chance encounter, filmmaker Nirvan Mullick met Caine Monroy, a 9yearold boy who built an elaborate cardboard arcade inside his dadâ€™s East LA auto parts shop. Nirvan was Caineâ€™s first customer. Amazed by the boyâ€™s creativity, Nirvan organized a flash mob of customers to surprise Caine and make his day. Then he made a film about it.</p>





<p>The Imagination Foundation is a new organization, but is rapidly becoming the leader of a worldwide movement to foster creativity, imagination and entrepreneurship in children.  The film that launched the Imagination Foundation, â€œCaineâ€™s Arcade,â€ has been widely cited as one of the most inspirational stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views, trended worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans, and inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across the globe. The Christian Science Monitor calls the film a â€œgreat American story,â€ and Wired Magazine writes, â€œItâ€™s a sweet story that brings viewers back to a time of potent imagination and creativity.â€</p>





<p>Our first Global Cardboard Challenge took place in October 2012, with thousands of participants in 41 countries on six continents.</p>","<p>As a largescale community event, the Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will engage numerous stakeholders, including schools, districts, charter management organizations, community groups, colleges and universities, businesses, nonprofit organizations, government and elected offices, and general members of the Los Angeles community.</p> 





<p>Trash for Teaching will be able to provide recycled materials. Skype  in the Classroom will help connect classes here in Los Angeles with classes in other parts of the world.</p>





<p>Media partners, such as YouTube, will promote and feature Challenge activities.</p>","<p>The success of the Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will be measured by multiple factors, including: those that demonstrate the level and degree of participation in the Challenge; those that demonstrate the level of school engagement and attitudes toward school; those that demonstrate mastery of key standards related to creative thinking, problem solving and social entrepreneurship; and those that demonstrate mastery of STEMrelated content (such as math and engineering).</p>





<p>The scale of the Challenge is critical to its success, so we will track the number of participants across four major groups: children, teachers, schools and general members of the community who will attend the Day of Play at local cardboard arcades in their area.</p>





<p>Success will also be measured by the amount of money raised by children operating their cardboard arcades on October 5, the Day of Play.</p>





<p>The quality and amount of online content uploaded during the time period of the Challenge will be carefully tracked and managed to ensure an expansive web catalogue of Challenge activities. Built on top of a simple and robust open source platform, this website will register Challenge participants, provide participant content feeds for uploading and sharing relevant material, show the various cardboard arcade locations, and handle RSVPâ€™s for local Day of Play events.</p>





<p>Surveys to assess teacher satisfaction will be completed online.</p>





<p>An assessment administered by teachers through a short online question bank will measure the proficiency of student participants with regard to appropriate Common Core standards outlined in the Caineâ€™s Arcade curriculum, as well as unique standards that demonstrate an increase in creative thinking, Social Emotional Learning, and attitudes toward school.</p>","We envision a city in which creativity is a core social value and a critical skill developed in every child; where the innate passion, curiosity and creativity of children is nurtured in schools, homes and communities everywhere; where all children are taught to be creative thinkers and doers, and encouraged to make their very best ideas happen in the world.





The Caineâ€™s Arcade Challenge will celebrate and develop the creativity and social entrepreneurship of children on a grand scale throughout the Southland. The Challenge will also showcase the role adults can play in fostering these traits. Specifically, the Challenge will engage 10,000 children, 500 teachers, 100 schools, building over 100 cardboard arcades, and raising over $25,000 for local charitable causes.





Student participants will become more creative, more entrepreneurial and more empathetic. Teacher participants will become more proficient at projectbased learning and more networked to each other locally and globally. Other adult participants who attend events on the Day of Play will learn about the simple things they can do to foster creativity in children. The scale of the event will raise public awareness about the value of creativity.





Over the course of the Challenge, projectbased learning and social entrepreneurship will proliferate throughout the city. A website designed for the Challenge will capture content from the various participants: photos, videos, lesson plans, activity kits, blogs and other content will showcase the ingenuity of students and their teachers, and become sources for inspiration and the mass proliferation of projectbased learning beyond the scope of the Challenge itself.","In 2050, creativity will be a core social value and a critical skill fostered and developed in every school and community.  Creativity will be as fundamental to the education of our children as literacy, and schools will be designed accordingly. In 2050, we will have a thriving network of ""Imagination Chapters"" throughout LA County, and every school and community center will have devoted space for children to discover their passions and practice building the things they imagine. Angelenos  young and old  will face the challenges of our city with optimism, invention and creativity.

3102123,2013123,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ImPactFarms.html,Organizing Social Enterprise Urban Farm in South Los Angeles, Income & Employment,"ImPact Farms, has a plan to develop underutilized property and building rooftops in South Los Angeles into Hydroponic/ Aquaponic Urban Farms. These high tech soilless Urban farms are capable of producing 10 to 20 times more produce per sq. ft. as compared to traditional soil farms. The increased yield is the result of an extended growing season, controlled environment and growing in three dimension and are essential to supporting investment in Urban Farms.





As a triplebottomline Social Enterprise, ImPact Farms replaces outsourced manufacturing with agricultural technology while directly and indirectly supporting a potential of 30 local permanent, familysupportivewage jobs per acre. 








At ImPact Farms, we define familysupportivewage as the income required to support three people as established by the city of Los Angeles and then add health and other benefits. As a matter of policy, base wages will be adjusted for inflation using the US Census Cost of Living Index. In addition employees are eligible to participate in a profit sharing pool committed at 20% of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).








ImPact Farms founders are committed to converting profit sharing into 40% employee ownership within 15 years, using the latest models, definitions, and ideas for ownership transfer and classifications from the Sustainable Economies Law Group (SELC) in their policy group's public comment for the proposed Worker Cooperative Statute to be put into the CA Corporations Codes. Although it is in the drafting process, we have included this to show Impact Farms' commitment to creating fair and meaningful worker ownership.





Los Angeles, benefits from keeping more of our â€œfood dollarâ€ circulating in the Local economy. Meeting Los Angeles nutritional requirements locally by 2050 could retain as much as $10 billion annually representing over 90,000 permanent local jobs.





Even community groups will benefit from profit sharing at 10% of EBITDA for nutritional, education and to fulfill other group defined quality of life objectives.





ImPact Farms is able to sell its organic, locally grown, fresh and therefore highly nutritive vegetables, fruit and fish at an affordable rate in South LA community and offer the above mentioned benefits


by selling its produce at a premium price in wealthier neighborhoods and bringing revenue and income back into the inner city. Our one day harvest to table direct delivery to households will be specially helpful to singleparent families and those who have no or limited access to transportation, saving them time from shopping they can use the time to prepare fresh food and enjoy quality time with family members. For example, to further ease access to fresh food, ImPact Farms in cooperation with LAUSD will provide CSA produce and eventually meals at school sites for parents to pick up when they pick up their children.





Our goal is to create jobs that allow the community to build wealth and equity that will help create a middle class in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as opposed to creating many minimumwage jobs that barely raise people above the poverty line. A middle class strata has the economic power to impact the real estate economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to higher property and income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power that will bring more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding businesses. ImPact Farms solution directly addresses Los Angeles existing income disparity.","While yet to begin operations, we have engaged and raised the passion of many of our stakeholders such as local government offices, community organizations, property owners and individuals through presentations that demonstrate ImPact Farmâ€™s alignment with quality of life objectives ranging from jobs, health and environment to growing Local Economies. ImPact Farms is currently organized as a Delaware corporation and plans to become a California Benefit/Flexible Purpose corporation with the award.





In addition, we have identified and are in discussion with 3 sites in South Los Angeles where we are considering for development.","We have presented our business plan to  the following agencies and organization and are fortunate to have their support and count on them as partners and collaborators.





â€¢ The 9th district city council office


â€¢ The 9th district neighborhood association/ CAANDU


â€¢ South Los Angeles Industrial Tract (BID)


â€¢ Economic Development Agency


â€¢ Genesis LA, Community Development Institute, Funding source


â€¢ Evergreen Cooperative, Cleveland Ohio


â€¢ Emerging Markets, Inc.


â€¢ PV Jobs, A job training and placement agency


â€¢ Slow Money, National org. encouraging investment in local food


â€¢ Community Services Unlimited,  a community organization working to increase access to healthy food in South Central Los Angeles.


â€¢ Sustainable Business Council


â€¢ Green LAVA","Urban farming is a capitalintensive undertaking requiring organizational capital, property and improvements to achieve economies of scale. As such ImPact Farmâ€™s success depends on our ability to raise additional capital to move into production and for growth. Offering triple bottom line returns, we understand capital is available from Socially Responsible Investors (SRI) and public through a Direct Public Offering (DPO) under California exemptions.





As such our first measure of success is completion of a Social Enterprise legal structure, positioning ImPact farms for a successful DPO of $1 million or more. A  grant of $100k empowers us to establish our company as a â€œBenefit or Flexible Purposeâ€ corporation in California and create a successful marketing and branding campaign that will enable us to establish a successful DPO campaign. A DPO structure allows for those with small capital to invest in a local company where they see the direct impact to the community and where they have a role in the growth of their capital. Imagine empowering these small investors in Los Angeles to participate and engage in a company that is dedicated to shaping their region. Imagine middle class and low income families becoming small investors and having ownership in a local company that directly affects their livelihood and health.





Impact Farms commits to taking the B Corporation impact assessment within a year of start of operations. B Corporation is a set of third party standards that attempts to measure social and environmental impact in four major areas: Governance, Workers, Community and the Environment, with reporting and measurement of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in each category.  Whether it is B Corp or another third party standard, Impact Farms commits as a matter of policy to annual reporting on social and environmental impact using some set of third party standards.








A second measure of pre revenue success is the number of community members and organizations enrolled in becoming a part of our cooperative business development and distribution programs. Stakeholders and community will be able to engage ImPact farms through our website, twitter, Facebook and proprietary internet systems developed to manage the community organizational process. We are looking to engage 2,000 people by the end of 2013.





","Income and Employment:





Over 525K households and 1.9M people reside within six (6) miles of Impact Farms in South LA, a community consisting primarily of African Americans and Latino populations whose unemployment rate is 18.3% and 13.3% respectively.





Median household income of $54,314 for a family of four,  suggests almost 950,000 people within a six mile radius did not earn enough to cover basic expenses. That 80,000 households within a mile of ImPact Farms, have median household incomes of less than $35K, suggest that over 170K people are living on less than 67% of established minimum requirements.





ImPact Farms policies will prioritize hiring and training local community members including troubled youth and those needing a second chance. We will also target local source vendors.





Every acre developed will directly and indirectly generate up to 30 full time permanent jobs.  Half of these positions are internal and include seeding, managing the growing environment, harvesting, packaging, maintaining fluid systems and caring for fish. Indirectly ImPact Farms wis looking to develop local vendors for operational requirements and will offer funding and training to start ancillary cooperatives related to Impact Farmâ€™s business such as distribution, packaging, and food preparation, potentially adding an additional 15 positions. Together the ImPact Farms network can generate 30X the jobs of a comparatively sized space and cost of a photovoltaic electricity system.





In addition, greening and upgrading existing fields and buildings for farming operations will require ImPact Farms to invest $1.5 $2.5 million per acre in addition to the cost of the property. While some components will be imported our intention is to engage local companies, social enterprises and cooperatives to perform work. As such, estimating labor at 30%, creates local wages for the improvements between $250750K.





Together, bringing the farm closer to the table, every 5 acres developed represents $45 million in annual local wages and benefits and an additional $2.5 million in improvement wages.





Health: 


Clearly, more and more studies show that eating a variety of whole, fresh food void of toxins is our best defense against chronic diseases through improving our immune and defense mechanisms. It is in this background of food desert caused mainly by lack of access to a wholesome diet that ImPact Farms makes another important contribution. Improved health via access to affordable fresh vegetables and fruit through community supported agriculture (CSAs), local, corner stores and ImPact Farms store front.





Environmental Quality:


Compared to traditional soil agriculture, for every acre of production ImPact Farm saves:


â€¢ 8+ million gallons of water


â€¢ 40+ tons of CO2 from farms and food transportation


â€¢ 90+ tons of CO2 consumed locally by plants


These estimates are based on farm studies,  reported water saving @70% and calculations of plant C02 absorption for 1M pounds of produce.","Becoming food secure by 2050, Los Angeles has created jobs allowing members of  the poorest neighborhoods to build wealth and equity to move into middle class. The middle class has the economic power to impact the real estate economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to higher property and income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power that will bring more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding businesses.





ImPact farms does this by developing the technical, social responsibility and distribution leadership as a foundation for Los Angeles to become food secure by 2050.  If every Billion dollars of imported goods cost local economies 9,000 jobs (Economic Policy Institute), becoming food secure would eliminate $10 billion of food and food product imports and create the opening for 90,000 local Familysupportivewage jobs in Los Angeles.





Imagine a South Central that has become a bustling economic center with beautiful, renovated architecture, access to plenty of organic, locally grown fresh food, a local food system (distribution, preparation and packaging) run by cooperative companies owned by the local residents. The rates of Obesity, diabetes, depression and violence are comparable to those of the more affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles as a result of access to fresh food and improved economic vibrancy. Furthermore, health care cost has reduced in LA. The local schools Academic Performance Index are comparable to those of the affluent neighborhoods and healthy, thriving children are learning and increasingly attending higher education institutions.

3102124,2013124,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/KCARUSO.html,LOLA the Lifelong Organizational Learning App, Education,"<P>Impact on the Educational landscape:  inclusive, forward moving, digital.<P>





<p>Itâ€™s easy to recall this typical schoolday scene: morning bell rings, kids line up, the teacher leads the way into the classroom and students find their places. <P>





<P>For some, however, this is also a time when confusion and isolation begin to set in. <P>





<P>Studentsâ€™ backpacks unzip, papers, books and pencil cases make their way to desktops, as some find themselves stuck in a maze, frozen, without any idea of which direction to turn. Each year more and more students in Los Angeles classrooms find themselves, as hard as they try, lost in these everyday situations.<P>








<p>These students struggle with executive function.<p>





<p>How do problems with executive function affect learning? 


Difficult to: make transitions, remember and retrieve information, solve problems, organize thoughts/actions and keep track of more than one thing at a time.<p>





<p>Our solution: LOLA, the Lifelong Organizational Learning App.


LOLA presents an Appbased solution to the organizational troubles experienced by the increasing numbers of students at large. This is a rare opportunity to assist children while also including parents and educators in the solution process, which, in turn, greatly reduces the time and effort spent supporting, often not yielding the progression towards necessary life skills. Through these proposed efficiencies, LOLA provides a low cost, high reward framework which benefits the entire community involved  but most importantly: the development of lifelong organizational capabilities of a child.<p>





<p>For example:


The LOLA work system: breaks down activities into manageable customizable task systems, which makes creating plans and keeping track of more than one thing at once a reality.


The LOLA timer: uses personalize reminders in the form of light, images and vibrations.


The LOLA messaging buttons: promotes private studenttoteacher communication to help:  students ask for help, seek more information when needed, wait to speak and remain on task.<p>





<p>As a result, LOLA, through seamless support and private communication between the teacher and student, eliminates any humiliation associated with being confused along with the shame that comes with being the struggling child. Moreover, other students are spared from the distractions that come when a teacher verbally redirects an offtask student; therefore, the entire classroom community flows smoothly, focuses on the lessons at hand and learning happens.<p>


","<P>Achievements in Educational landscape:  pragmatic, innovative, collaborative.<p>





<P>Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.<p>





<P>Our success story: in the fall of 2012, Karen met Lola, a bright, kindhearted, eager and willing thirdgrader, the type of student that inspires any teaching heart. As the first week of the school year unfolded, Karen observed Lola, despite her powers of persistence, struggle consistently with recalling/retrieving information that she needed to followed multistep directions. <P>





<P>Karen a veteran third grade teacher, knows that by third grade, kids start to take pride in â€œdoing things on their ownâ€ and too many reminders by a teacher elicit painful embarrassment. Fortunately, she had just participated in â€œStructuring the Learning Environmentâ€ a special ed professional development series offering strategies to help special needs kids get through â€œtasksâ€.  Building on what was learned, she began to create work systems on strips of paper for Lola that broke done daily routines and academic situations into â€œone step at a time listsâ€ and added a little animal clip for Lola to move as she progressed through each step. Karen, in collaboration with Lola's Mom, Carrie, formalized these systems for Lola by posting them in her planner and empowering her to check off her tasks as she went  allowing her to feel far more in control and independent. <P>





<P>It was almost magical: Lola went from being frozen to completely independent, with her â€œwork systemâ€ at hand. Building on Lolaâ€™s achievement, Karenâ€™s principal requested that she share her strategies with other teachers, who in turn successfully applied work systems with their struggling students. <P>





<P>The recent course Karen had taken, coupled with the perfect timing of having Lola as student along with the professional development she shared with other teachers made Karen realize just how many kids would in the future, benefit tremendously by a ""work system"" like she had informally developed for Lola, and an idea took root: an App version.<P>


","<p>Partnering in the Educational landscape:  social, efficient. <p>





<p>LOLA will establish a close partnership with Los Angeles schools and districts beyond.  Teacher, parents and students will partner in an unprecedented way, with technology as the uniting tool. LOLA  provides the first known technological tool to help students conquer their organizational challenges in such a stepbystep way <P>





<p>LOLA allows for the practice of customizing and accommodating for students with special needs to be standardized through the use of a consistent platform thus making the transition to a new classroom from one year to the next much smoother.<P>





","<P>Evaluating the Educational landscape:  student engagement, goal oriented, digital.<p>





<p>Alignment with National Common Core and Individual Education Plan Goals.


Measured by: Los Angeles schools student retention/graduation rates, teacher effectiveness ratings and district budget reductions within special education.<p>





<p>The creation of LOLA evolved from the urgent need to give students the tools that he/she needs in order to perform tasks necessary to everyday functioning. As this is the fundamental purpose of LOLA, when schools throughout Los Angeles utilize all that LOLA will offer, schools will see an increase in student engagement, increase in promotion of students with proficient or higher skills and an increase of teacher effectiveness on student engagement and classroom management. Consequently, the rate at which students graduate from high school, prepared for success in college and the workplace will drastically upsurge.<p>





<p>Also, by putting technology into the hands of students now only better prepares them to succeed as the new Common Core State Standards assessments which will be given primarily on computers or other digital devices where multiple types of items will be used, including computerenhanced items and performance tasks, in order to measure the full range of knowledge and skills called for in the CCSS. <p>


","<p>A healthier Los Angeles Educational landscape:  digital, efficient, forward moving. <p>





<p>The G o l d h i r s h F o u n d a t i o n has identified in their report that: 


Education received the lowest rating, meaning that is a significant impediment to human development. This outcome was based on the fact that the public school system in Los Angeles is failing many of its students. Graduation rates are low and too many kids throughout the county are not completing the necessary college preparatory coursework. Enrollment and investment in highquality preschool is also lacking. On top of this, continued cuts at the state level are making a bad situation worse. Given that education is such a fundamental aspect of human development with farreaching effects, the stark disparity in educational opportunities for the countyâ€™s students is unacceptable.





Letâ€™s start with this question: what do current special education services cost in the United States?


According to Nathan Levenson, in a study sponsored by the Fordham Institute special education represented about 21 percent of all education spending across the nation in 2005, or $110 billion, compared with 18 percent in 1996. (Layton 2012)





<p>Who are we talking about in Los Angeles? 


In LAUSD alone,  approximately 77,000 students currently have Individual Education Plans, of which some 50,000 students are identified as having trouble with executive function. (Cross & Joftus,2011)<p>





<p>In an era of budget cuts, can we do better? Yes we can!


The current implementation of 1:1 aides has not proven effective and so far the main tool used when a child needs help â€“this is tremendously expensive and not a solution that works towards increasing independence.<p>





<p>LOLA, a universal tool, requiring a relatively small investment will yield not only a huge learning impact on a large number of students, but also make a tremendously positive budgetary impact. <p>





<p>Think about it: the typical 2013 modernday LA classroom relies heavily on inconsistent, ineffective and costly practices such as: paper agendas, paper lists, verbal cues and oneonone aides, whereas LOLA creates an individual organizational system opportunity, along with a respectful and private communication system through digital technologies.<p>


","<p>The 2050 Los Angeles Educational landscape:  inclusive, tolerant, digital, social, efficient, paperresponsible, pragmatic, forward moving, collaborative, optimistic learning communities.<p>





<p>Imagine a classroom that truly implements technology to assist a student in becoming productive and self reliantâ€“ far beyond games and fun apps. Imagine a tool that could remain with a student for his/her entire day from dawn to dusk and transition with him/her from one school year to the next â€“ for a lifetime.  Imagine a tool that could address IEP goals all year long. Imagine a paperless organizational tool that facilitates all that: LOLA, the Lifelong organizational learning app.<p>





<p>We know technology will change. We know the world we live in will change. We know that an individual who has trouble with executive function will forever need support in order to navigate through his/her day. The tools that LOLA provide will break open and reframe education in 2013 and beyond by putting an otherwise nonexistent support tool in the hands of such individuals, which, due to customizable capacities, will evolve alongside technological advances and societal needs well into the year 2050.<p>

3102125,2013125,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Greening7thinDTLA.html,Greening 7th St. in Skid Row/DTLA, Environmental Quality,"My idea is to plant 30 mature shade trees along 7th St. in the industrial district/Skid Row section of downtown. These trees would be protected by colorful and decorative metal tree guards. This neighborhood shelters the largest stable homeless population in America, so in an effort to put people to work, we would hire people from Chrysalis Enterprises, a local company that specializes in placing people transitioning out of homelessness to water and care for the trees. This portion of 7th St. is set to receive a bike lane within the next couple of years, so the addition of trees would further multiply the overall quality of  life along and near 7th St., which for decades has been a crimeridden and blighted stretch.","Well before founding Industrial District Green, Katherine McNenny had begun laying the groundwork for future nonprofit greening activities. In December of 2011 after 12 months of preparation, she conducted her first planting of 7 trees along San Pedro St. in Skid Row between 4th and 5th Streets with the support of the Central City East Association (CCEA) and it's Executive Director, Estela Lopez. This successful first effort involved lobbying and coordinating with all relevant property owners, Jan Perryâ€™s office, the Bureau of Street Services, and TreePeople, who managed the plantings.





She is currently overseeing another tree planting also in Skid Row, with the LA Conservation Corps along Boyd & Omar Streets between 3rd and 4th. She has been working with property owners and sponsors on this project for several months now. The planting date will be March 23rd, 2013. Volunteers from Union Church (in Little Tokyo) and several local residents from the neighborhood will help plant the trees.","We intend to collaborate with the LA Conservation Corps (LACC) for their assistance in procuring the trees we plant & the concrete we cut. We intend to partner with TreePeople to train the workers we intend to hire to care for the trees.





We intend to partner with Chrysalis Enterprises to hire workers who are transitioning out of homelessness to water and maintain the trees bimonthly.





We intend to partner with Patrick Joyce of Canterbury International for fashioning the metal tree guards we feel are necessary to protect the trees (pictured in ""Preview"" document under ""Website"" heading).





We intend to partner with the Downtown LA Neighborhood Council and Union Church (in Little Tokyo) when we need volunteers to help plant the trees.","Simply stated, our success will be measured by how many trees we can plant and maintain along 7th St. between Main and Alameda Streets in the industrial district/Skid Row neighborhood of downtown. We will also measure our success by what sorts of sparks of economic revitalization happen along this boulevard after the trees have been planted. We will measure our success by our ability to engage the local community in this beautification process which will by demonstrated by our ability to attract volunteers for tree planting events, and finally our success will be measured by how many people are seen using 7th St. to walk, bike, socialize and rest under a shade tree in.","As the repurposing of downtown Los Angeles continues apace, an eclectic mix of urban functions is taking root including commercial, residential, recreational, and social. The industrial district or Skid Row section of downtown currently hosts functions as diverse as wholesaling, retailing, warehousing, nightlife, housing as well as an array of social services. But in many of these areas there has been a lag in commensurate infrastructure development (which stands in stark contrast to other downtown districts which have experienced significant attention and investment in recent years). While this lag is evident on many levels, one in particular stands out: greening. As the industrial district/Skid Row area increasingly accommodates a diverse set of activities, in many cases it continues to exude a grim sunbleached austerity more in keeping with it's original single purpose function.





Our project of greening 7th St. in downtown's underserved industrial area will not only improve community aesthetics but contribute to sustainability by addressing the urban heat island dynamic as well as improving the health and well being of it's growing population of residents and employees. ","Success would be mature, grown shade trees flanking 7th St. through the industrial district/Skid Row, which would compliment the proposed bike lanes. Success would be a cleaner, safer, more aesthetically pleasing boulevard where whole families can ride bikes, rest  and socialize on benches under majestic branches. Success would be full revitalization of a decades neglected stretch, economic vitality and a healthier population."
3102126,2013126,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MindfulLA.html,LA the capital of mindfulness in 2050, Health,"<p>Our idea is to transform the health of Los Angeles by catalyzing a mindfulness movement and changing behavior upstream. Working with health care professionals, schools, hospitals, clinics, businesses, community centers, and citizen leaders we will provide the tools, teachings, and network of teachers to help more people learn how to install healthy behaviors that benefit ourselves, our families, our institutions, and our city.</p>





<p>There are three specific components of this idea: </p>





<p>1. Expand the existing InsightLA training programs for health care professionals, which currently provide mindfulness training to health care professionals at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) and other LA hospitals (UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, St John's, CedarsSinai) and hospice programs, including a partnership with Skirball. Nurses, doctors, respiratory & other therapists, social workers, chaplains, and interpreters all receive mindfulness training. The program has proven to be popular and beneficial to the many health care professionals who have attended over the last six years. As eighty percent of child deaths in hospitals occur in ICUs, the mindfulness retreats were initially created to help PICU (Pediatric ICU) and NICU (Neonatal ICU) staffers deal with the grief of multiple losses. The program has since expanded to include practitioners from other units, including Hematologyoncology, Cardiothoracic, Surgery, Adolescent Medicine, and Bone Marrow Transplant. We are interested in expanding this program by launching a teacher training program that specializes on serving the health care system and the people who provide care. </p>





<p>2. Repair and open a new 17 acre property that has recently been transferred to InsightLA and can serve as a center for mindfulness in the heart of the city. The property is a unique asset offering access to nature, canyon views, native plants, and hiking trails. An estimated $75,000 are needed this year for basic repairs to make the space usable. Once those repairs are made, we intend to hold a retreat for professional caregivers from area hospitals and hospices, and with this grant we would also package the case study to create manuals and show how this model can be scaled to other health institutions in LA. We can also utilize the space to create similar programs targeted to specific professional fields and workplaces throughout the city, as well as community colleges and LAUSD, offering leadership trainings to help current and future leaders develop mindfulness tools to help solve LA's most pressing challenges.</p>





<p>3. Grow the network of teachers and programs that exists across LA in health care institutions, schools, and community centers through a Los Angeles Mindfulness Ambassador initiative. Currently, all InsightLA programs are open to the public, and participation is increasing. In addition to helping InsightLA launch a unique physical space, this project will help InsightLA take the mindfulness training programs online to increase reach and accessiblity of the trainings. Through this offline / online hybrid model, the project will effectively generate mindful leadership and action across our cultural, institutional, and community assets.</p>","We have trained more than 10,000 individual students in mindfulness. We have successfully maintained daily programs for which NO person is turned away for lack of funds. We have trained nurses, doctors, and social workers in mindfulness practices to deal with the dying and bereaved. We received grants totaling more than a halfmillion dollars from the Federal government to train clinicians at the Veterans Administration of Los Angeles to help them treat chronic sufferers of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other conditions suffered by American veterans. We have expanded from a group of mindfulness practitioners meeting in a living room one night a week to fullservice centers in three locations, and two satellite locations in the San Fernando Valley and South Bay. We have brought in nationally renowned speakers and held large public forums to educate citizens about how mindfulness can improve their lives.","<p>Our intention is to partner wherever possible and appropriate to help scale the impact.





Children's Hospital of Los Angeles is the initial pilot for a health care institution, and we will look to build on existing partnerships with UCLA Pediatric Pain Program, UCLArts and Healing, the SIMMS/MANN Center for Integrative Oncology, the Cancer Support CommunityBenjamin Center, and the LA Veteran's Administration.





Green Yoga Association, or another relevant partner, will serve as an environmental steward for the 17 acre property. 





Foundation for a Mindful Society (Mindful magazine & Mindful.org) will help document the pilot programs.





InsightLA Ed, the educational arm of InsightLA, will administer education and training programs.","We will measure success by the ability to open the 17 acre facility this year, which currently is unfunded; by the number of health care professionals and community leaders who are trained in mindfulness; the number of new mindfulness teachers who go through InsightLA Programs; the number of communities with new practitioners and new teachers; and the number of people these teachers reach. Digital metrics will also be tracked, though additional resources will be needed to take that initiative to scale. The institute also has unprecedented opportunity to introduce mindfulness to LA based celebrities and athletes who can then engage the city and the world with the empiricallyproven, scientificallyvalidated, experientiallycontagious, costeffective solution of meditation and mindfulness. Therefore, the number of influencers going through the program will also be tracked.","<p>This project will create a world class resource for training leaders in the mindfulness movement in the heart of Los Angeles. With new access to a property of 17 acres of pristine nature, this project will enable InsightLA to create a functional space for training health care professionals, educators, and other community leaders to become mindfulness practitioners and teachers in Los Angeles. By 2050, the program will have trained thousands of Mindfulness Ambassadors for the city, including health care professionals, educators, and community leaders, and provided the catalytic support to make Los Angeles a 'mindful city' that addresses health and environmental indicators upstream. In addition, free training resources will be provided online, so anyone can improve their mindfulness and drive positive behavior change in their own lives. This project, while focused on health, attacks all of the indicators at their root, by giving each of us and all of us the tools and training to be more mindful and considerate about the way we engage with the social, political, and natural environment and contribute to our families, our communities, and our city.</p>","In 2050, LA is locally, nationally, and globally recognized as a leader in mindfulness. Thousands of active LA Mindfulness Ambassadors represent all of our neighborhoods and institutions. LA is seen as the city that pioneered healthy behaviour change through a mix of meditation and mindfulness training, which then led to more mindful systematic change. Our health care system has shifted to helping people live proactive healthy lives rather than treating chronic problems. The majority of citizens and actions are mindful, which leads to a drastic decrease in chronic disease, a more functional and solvent health system, and longer, more productive, healthier lives."
3102127,2013127,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/conflictresolution.html,Listening Communication and Conflict Resolution Skills for Los Angeles, Social Connectedness,"This idea will provide those who wish to learn listening, communication and conflict resolution skills the opportunity to do so at multiple locations throughout Los Angeles.  Social connections are impacted by how we interact with one another.  When conflict occurs, there are opportunities to listen and communicate in a way that increases the possibility of resolving disputes, and building social connections.  Too few opportunities are available to members of the public to learn and apply listening, communication and conflict resolution skills.  This will help move Los Angeles toward more effectively addressing the inevitable conflict that we encounter in the most constructive ways possible.  ","More than 2,000 members of the public were trained by Avis RidleyThomas in the years that I oversaw the Los Angeles City Attorney's Dispute Resolution Program of the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney.  Emeritus UCLA Professor Buzz Wilms initiated a class at UCLA in 2001, and hundreds of undergraduates have been trained as a result of that class.","There is a vibrant dispute resolution and dialogue and deliberation community in Los Angeles.  All of these collaborators will be made aware and invited to participate in this initiative, if it is selected for funding.","We will train and work with hundreds of people who want to find better ways of communicating and resolving conflict.  They will obtain a better understanding of community resources to assist them, and learn to intervene effectively to help resolve disputes wherever they occur.","It will help advance the mission of ""a mediator on every block,"" allowing neighbors, coworkers and family members to better interact and create more profound social connections.","Listening, communication and mediation skills would be standard curriculum in schools, and standard operating procedure at homes and in workplaces throughout Los Angeles.  Any persons involved in miscommunication, misunderstanding or conflict would get multiple opportunities to resolve the matter quickly and constructively.  A culture change would occur in our city, resulting in significantly fewer matters which result in violent behavior. "
3102128,2013128,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/invisiblepeople.html,Los Angeles Invisible People Chapter and Film Festival, Housing,"<p>Invisible People connects people to the face of homelessness in a direct and meaningful way that humanizes the subject and builds empathy in the viewer. This is way more important and impactful than simple awareness and has caused communities to rethink their policies on homelessness. We have traveled to over a hundred cities in six different countries empowering our homeless friends to have a voice, while sharing the stories of people who are giving their all to end homelessness. </p>





<p>Since its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, their on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.</p>





<p>Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and canâ€™t ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nationâ€™s most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath  its founder  and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.t shatter the stereotypes of Americaâ€™s homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.</p>





<p>In an effort to capitalize on the leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement successes weâ€™ve enjoyed, IP is refocusing its lens to a hyperlocal model.  This means we plan to open Invisible People chapters in strategic regions across the nation over the coming months so that local homeless population issues can be addressed community by community.  We are proposing to open our first chapter in the greater Los Angeles area serving all of Los Angeles County </p>





<p>In large metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, where the wealthy often share space and resources with the poor, it is particularly important to establish social ties across socioeconomic groups capable of increasing connections between the public and the homeless.</p>





<p>Different from the main Invisible People, the hyperlocal Los Angeles Invisible People will focus only on stories of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Additionally, the Los Angeles Invisible People will not only engage people to take action, this local chapter will become a twoway interactive guide for people to connect to political actions or volunteer opportunities. </p>

3102129,2013129,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SOUTHLAHUB.html,The South LA Hub: Strengthening Nonprofits in South Los Angeles , Social Connectedness,"<p>Imagine a stronger, more connected South LA. This vision means more resident participation, deeper connections between community members, and greater collaboration amongst community organizations. The road to this vision of Los Angeles relies on strengthening and supporting the entities that are designed to bring people together.</p>





<p>We are working with a group of nonprofits to create a hub for capacity building using the talents and strengths of nine veteran organizations who have worked in the field.  By finding new roles for these veteran leaders and managers in South LA, we create pathways for emerging leaders, increase earned income for the nonprofits by providing consulting and technical assistance to their peers and strengthen social connection through these interactions. Our goal is to fortify the nonprofit infrastructure in a part of LA that is underserved in order to see a stronger movement towards civic engagement.</p>





<p>Capacity building and technical assistance support is a $2billion industry in the US led by consultants and forprofit management service agencies (Foundation Center).  By coalescing nonprofit organizations in South LA and establishing a physical space for these leaders and managers to crowdsource, our model will increase collaborative efforts and result in healthier nonprofit organizations. The hub model conserves resources by promoting strategic partnerships and assist organizations in developing business plans, exchanging skills and knowledge, breaking their isolation and adding more focus to their individual efforts.</p>





<p>Envision a place in South LA bustling with small groups of nonprofit leaders collaborating to share ideas and spark innovation. Imagine a hub for peer learning that is available to members in Spanish and English, with sessions led not by external experts, but by people in the community that leaders can relate to. Here nonprofit managers can bring their questions on the difficult to navigate financial statements, for example, and receive oneonone support from a peer organization trained and verified as having skill within this topic of interest. This mentor organization will serve as an ongoing point of contact for resource sharing between the two agencies. Both organizations participate in peerled sessions on community mobilization strategies while gaining partners in daytoday challenges of managing an organization as well as allies in the movement to engage communities. </p>





<p>Different than other collaborative models already at work in South LA and Boyle Heights, this effort works specifically build capacity within organizations versus creating a campaign or agenda. Our goal is to provide tools to organizations so that they might be more effective and connected to others when engaging in work of their own. </p>





<p>With the support of LA2050, we will take the first step in creating this environment. By December 31, 2013 we will design this buhlike model and launch a series of â€˜Peerled Consulting Conveningsâ€™ to engage at least 100 South LA organizations in peerled capacity building support around their pressing management challenges. This effort requires the identification and training of nine veteran nonprofits with demonstrated skill in civic engagement work and internal management. At least 30 participating organizations will benefit from oneoneone consulting support from the veteran leaders. Through the convenings, these trained veterans will offer free, highquality consulting to their peers, building a stronger network of capable community engagement organizations within the nonprofit landscape. In turn, these organizations will be more resilient and better equipped to lead Los Angeles towards a new era of greater connectedness.</p>","<p>As a management consulting firm, Jemmott Rollins Group has built a reputation for developing innovative concepts and providing leadership in working with marginalized communities.

Although identifying the nine partner organizations is a critical step for once the initiative has begun, already, outstanding organizations have expressed commitment to participate in this work. One of these leading nonprofits is the Community Coalition of South Los Angeles (www.cocosouthla.org), a veteran  community action organization based in South Los Angeles. ","<p>Jemmott Rollins Group will evaluate the project in large part by measuring organizational change as a result of participation in the program. This information wil be collected through analysis of the needs assessments of a sample group of organizations and postconvening surveys and interviews. With the nine partner organizations, we will use the Core Capacity Assessment Tool (CCAT) to more systematically measure growth before and after participating in coaching, training and consulting engagement.</p>





 <p>The CCAT is a 146question online survey developed by TCC group (http://www.tccccat.com/) that measures a nonprofit organization's effectiveness and can taken multiple times to measure development over time. â€œThe CCAT is the most comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool of its kind, and has been used by funders and nonprofits as a planning, capacity building, research, and evaluation tool.â€ â€“ TCC Group.</p>","With the cityâ€™s massive physical landscape, our slow move towards an integrated public transit system, and the fastpaced lifestyle many of us lead, itâ€™s not easy for Angelenos to connect with one another. Without mechanisms to facilitate interactions, or organizations ready with the skills, strategies and tactics to effectively encourage public engagement, Los Angeles will have more of the same fragmented, often unengaged communities. Our goal is to build up Los Angeles organizations that focus on civic engagement, voter turnout, neighborhoodbased advocacy, and local community building to change this. 





With stronger, more collaborative, and strategic community organizations, Los Angeles residents will receive better services, become more informed, and find new pathways to participate in community. In time, this means higher voter turnout, greater civic discourse, heightened community collaboration, and new organizations and campaigns coming from the ground up. These neighborhood based initiatives would be made of people with skills to tackle almost any issue â€“ from crime and violence prevention to lowperforming schools and public health. 





UCLAâ€™s Luskin Center for Public Affairsâ€™ report on the state of nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles County found an extreme service gap in lowincome communities â€“ nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods. This means that, at present day, the people in Los Angeles who have the least support are those who essentially need it the most. Our focus on South Los Angeles represents a desire to reverse the service gap by strengthening the organizations that already exist so that they might more effectively engage Angelenos. The regional emphasis also represents our longterm commitment to serving underserved communities of color. We strongly believe that the South Los Angeles Hub is the first step in designing an engagement model that can be replicated citywide.


",We could be described as friendly antagonists. Certainly we have a history and track record of cooperation and collaboration with the efforts of other management service organizations. We have learned from them and engaged in thought partnership with them. Our efforts in many ways complement theirs and have caused them to step up their efforts in areas like culturallycompetent capacity building and deconstructing racism as a factor that perpetuates poverty and injustices.  
3102130,2013130,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/JCSupportiveHousing.html,Enhanced Permanent Supportive Housing for Victims of Domestic Violence, Housing,"<p>In response to addressing the need for temporary shelter, supportive services and permanent housing assistance, Jenesse Center provides family-centered transitional programs to underserved and unserved victims of domestic violence and their children who are moving from instability and violence to safety and independence.  Jenesse Centerâ€™s state of the art services are designed to help clients become self-sufficient, as the agency recognizes that becoming economically empowered is an essential component for every clientâ€™s transition to self-sufficiency.  Jenesseâ€™s experiences over the last 33 years has shown that affordable, permanent housing is a key component in helping our clients to break the cycle of violence in their lives once and for all.  Therefore, our idea is to provide long-term, supportive housing to victims of domestic violence by converting one of our transitional shelters into a permanent supportive housing facility for twelve families consisting of four to six individuals.  Jenesseâ€™s main strategy under this initiative is to ensure that survivors of domestic violence are rapidly placed into permanent housing after completing our transitional program.  This strategy ensures maintenance and expansion of placement for homeless domestic violence survivors at Jenesse Center, thereby completing our housing continuum. </p>





<p>Clients that are eligible for permanent housing through Jenesse will have access to a wide range of supportive services including: Independent Living and Life Skills Training; Legal Representation; Vocational Education Programs; Economic Empowerment Workshops; Childrenâ€™s Enrichment Program: Individual and Group Counseling; Mental Health Services; Health Education and Management; and Community Resources and Referrals.  Services will be provided free of charge and will be focused on safety and sustaining independent living.</p>","Jenesse Center has long believed that in order to make a real and lasting change in how families and communities view and respond to domestic violence, we have to talk about it openly and honestly. Since their inception, Jenesse has successfully begun to change the conversation on domestic violence and remove a lot of the stigma unfairly associated with the issue.





The â€œConversationsâ€ events began in 1999 to bring together new and potential friends and supporters, in a relaxed environment to discuss new and exciting ways to support Jenesse. The events also provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue and remind people that victims of domestic violence should be applauded and supported in their efforts to stand tall, and ready, to improve their lives and the lives of their children.

We currently have a working relationship with Los Angeles Housing Department to support our efforts,Jenesse has a great success in sustaining  and evaluting new programs that are later fully intergrated into the overall complement of core services provided to domestic violence clients.,"Jenesse's own data and experience in this issue also found that affordable housing and insufficient resurces contributes to the chronic homeless problems of our clients.  After completing our program, our clients are ready to live on their own providing a safe, nuturing home for themselves and their children.  Nonetheless, being able to do so is not an easy task.  Thie high cost of rent and poor credit scores often make it nearly impossible for them to attain adequate housing.    Our data reports that , of clients who graduated from our transitional program, 30% had to move in with family, 37% moved to rental housing, 7% leave Jenesse and go to another transtional or homeless shelter, 6% move into Section 8 or other subsidized housing, 3% move to a psychiatric hospital, and 17% are unknown.  According to the United Way, 70% of Angelenos cannot afford to purchase a home and renters spend disproportionately more for housing than homeowners.  With a rapid increase in demand and a slow increase in supply, the United Way reports that both rental and home prices have skyrocketed over the past few years, with the majority of renters in SPA 6 having to use 50% or more of their income just to pay rent.  





Jenesse has been studying this problem for years and knows that women who exit our program need affordable, permanent housing. This is why Jenesse Center, Inc. plans to transform some of its transitional housing into affordable, low-income housing.


The facilities will accommodate unserved and underserved members of SPA 6 including those who have not previously resided in a Jenesse facility, including emancipated youth. Jenesse will offer tenants self-contained an interactive facility that contains a classroom/computer lab, recreation room, and in-house store. All tenants will be mandated to follow a client responsibility standard that will be explained to them before they move in.

A home and family for those without, Jovenes provides an innovative program of stable housing options, compassionate care, life skills training and employment support to young adults seeking a path to life change. Our experience working with homeless and atrisk youth shows us that when young people are disconnected from empowering opportunities and supportive networks (families, schools, communities), they end up languishing on the fringes of society.</p> 





<p>In 2010, Jovenes began asking the question â€œhow can we do a better job of connecting youth with the help they need, and leverage the resources and opportunities provided by our partners?â€ Easytouse technology was our answer, so we developed and launched The Beacon Network (TBN). TBN uses the Internet to offer youth a means to connect and evaluate their options linking both themselves, and their loved ones, to local free or lowcost solutions.  </p> 





<p>Youth in lowincome communities throughout Los Angeles have many needs and challenges, and finding out where to go for help can be overwhelming because there is no one organization that can address all these issues. They also often shoulder responsibility for their families, performing tasks of childcare for younger relatives, getting jobs to support their parents, and translating for nonEnglish speaking family members. This expanded role can be overwhelming. Los Angeles, and Boyle Heights in particular, has a rich fabric of nonprofit organizations and social service providers who do outstanding work that leads clients to selfsufficiency and societal integration. However, community members, particularly youth, have trouble finding out how to access the help they need. </p> 





<p>The Beacon Network Connect (www.tbnconnect.org) is a bilingual online referral directory tailored to youth in Boyle Heights and East LA. It offers over 250 free to lowcost services that are locally available, allowing youth to find and access the help they need. There are seven core service categories: 1) Youth Community Resources (after school programs, mentoring, arts & culture, volunteer opportunities and more), 2) Education, 3) Health, 4) Basic Needs (including childcare, food, clothing, employment, housing/shelter), 5) Counseling and Support Groups, 6) Legal Assistance, 7) Financial Services. Itâ€™s a site that helps youth search, connect, and thrive.</p> 


 


<p>The Beacon Network features a second online platform that is changing the way nonprofits collaborate (www.thebeaconnetwork.org). By including other nonprofit agencies on our site, and allowing these organizations to collect, pool and share data over time, we are better able to understand the communityâ€™s gaps in service and changing needs. It also connects agency staff with resources and events throughout our community via a constantly updated calendar and biweekly enewsletter. Identifying needed services and new community partners is a vital part of this effort.</p> 





<p>Our 2050 idea is continue and expand the reach & depth of TBN while training homeless youth that we serve to provide outreach to the teens and young adults of Boyle Heights.   This outreach is vital to reaching youth who might otherwise feel disengaged and unconnected.  In addition it will provide work experience, confidence building, leadership training, and a stipend to youth who are experiencing homelessness.  We have pilot tested this peerâ€“topeer outreach model and know that inspires our youth and connects with young people in the community.</p> ","<p>Jovenes, Inc. is a growing organization that is changing the way homeless youth access opportunities for a brighter future. In the last year, weâ€™ve doubled our housing capacity through the creation of permanent supportive and affordable housing. We used to only be able to house 20 youth in our shortterm shelter programs (for lengths of stay less than 18 months). Now, we are able to provide youth with their own apartments and continually support them as they grow into selfsufficient adults. At this point, Jovenes is housing 41 youth across our continuum of care more than at any other point in our history. Our permanent housing programs have a 96% retention rate since opening in 2012.</p>





<p>Launching The Beacon Network in 2011 was a major accomplishment for our organization. As a traditional socialservice organization that focuses primarily on the 1:1 work with our clients, taking on TBN required a different skillset, vision, and capacity. TBN was developed through a process that included gaining input from many different nonprofit partners on what information would be most useful to their clients & staff, as well as holding focus groups of youth to test the functionality and clarity of the system, as well as marketing strategies. As a result, TBN Connect has over 4,800 searches per year!</p>","The Beacon Network lists over 250 programs and resources readily available in Boyle Heights and East LA. The California Endowment and the Building Healthy CommunitiesBoyle Heights initiative are major sources of collaboration for this project.





In late 2013, TBN will be officially housed at the brand new Wellness Center at USC + LAC General Hospital. The Wellness Center will house likeminded nonprofit organizations that have the vision of making Boyle Heights a healthier community. 





TBN would not be possible without Idealistics, Inc., a social sector consultancy that helps organizations learn from their outcomes data, increase impact, and demonstrate results to funders and stakeholders. 


","<p>TBN was launched in 2011, and since then, TBNConnect averages over 1,200 searches every quarter. More than 40 organizations are connected through The Beacon Network, and our enewsletters and shared calendars reach dozens of case managers who are then able to refer their clients to needed resources and activities. With LA 2050 behind TBN, these numbers will grow.</p> 





<p>One of the strengths of TBN is its focus on data and analysis. We are able to collect the demographic profile of people who voluntarily submit information during the TBNConnect intake page, as well as the services they are searching for and what they need. This capability allows us to know who we are reaching.  We can measure how many youth are using the system.  We can track through a privacy protected system the general locations where youth are accessing the platform and focus outreach on areas where usage is low.  Other measures would be how many trainings our youth are able to facilitate and how many nonprofit partners regularly use The Beacon Network.  </p> ","As beacons are guides that steer wayward ships into shore, nonprofits and social service agencies help our clients overcome the obstacles they face on a daily basis.  The Beacon Network online resource directory provides an easy, efficient way for youth and others in need to find resources  housing, job training, educational opportunities, legal assistance, after school activities  without the need for a case manager.  We believe that this fosters independence and a sense of control.  In addition, the system can be used by caseworkers to quickly find a complete list of opportunities for their clients.  





We see that many organizations, despite being geographic neighbors, are not connected with each other and need ways to share information about available programs, resources, and events to each otherâ€™s clients. By adding webbased tools that target both the youth of our community and the agencies that serve them, we have an opportunity to increase the level of communication across agency lines and improve our shared neighborhoods.  





The project would increase usage of TBN and engage homeless youth. Homeless youth are one of the most socially disconnected subpopulations in the city, yet everyday we hear our youth say they want ways to give back to the community. We believe by creating leadership and developmental opportunities that are combined with the promotion of TBN, we are able create an empowering experience for youth that also provides them with marketable skills. 





Expanding TBN would benefit Los Angeles in the following ways:


1)	Increase access to vital resources in highneed communities.


2)	Provide training and leadership opportunities for homeless youth.


3)	Provide a replicable, techbased model for other areas of LA to create neighborhood based solutions and connections.


4)	Continue building and strengthening the lines of communication between nonprofit organizations and provide the best combination of service and care for a community in need. 


","<p>Los Angeles is a decentralized city of neighborhoods. Each local community has its own unique history, characteristics, challenges, and flavor. </p>





<p>We hope that by 2050, these communities will have developed placebased strategies that successfully integrate their residents into the social fabric of Los Angeles. It means that youth live in communities where they can take full advantage of the resources available to them, and that organizations, funders, politicians, and stakeholders break out of their silos to expand opportunity for all. </p>





<p>We see technology and the Internet as a tool to accomplish this, not a solution in of itself. Logging onto TBN and conducting a search will not â€œsolveâ€ the problems faced by an individual youth or their family, but it is the first step towards arriving at a better life. For the homeless youth at Jovenes, social connectedness means that our youth know they are valued members of a community, that their personal futures matter, and that they are not alone anymore. We can only build that connectedness through personal relationships and trust, but first we have to get them to our doors. The same goes for youth facing other challenges, and while there may not be enough case managers or guidance counselors to connect with every young person, TBN is the tool that can create that linkage.</p>





<p>It is from that place that we can then work on the crucial tasks of social connection through voting, volunteering, raising the voices and aspirations of our youth.</p>"
3102132,2013132,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Jumpstart.html,Jumpstart: Preschool Changes Everything, Education,"<p>Over 20,000 Angelinos enter the modern economy every year without a high school degree. It is simply unacceptable that in a city as wealthy and vibrant as ours, countless children go their entire lives without receiving an adequate education. Itâ€™s not just that they are not reaching their potential; they are not even coming close. As a community, we are failing these children.</p>





<p>Think thatâ€™s scary? Now consider this. Many children are already so far behind by the age of five (no, thatâ€™s not a typo), that they are unlikely ever to catch up. This is nothing less than a catastrophe. Children whose parents have a lowincome begin kindergarten up to 60% behind their more affluent peers â€“ and 74% of the LAUSD student body is economically disadvantaged. The only silver lining in this heartbreaking story is that we have already discovered the most impactful, costeffective solution to this problem devastating our city.</p>





<p>The answer is highquality early education. Investments in highquality early education transform lives and yield extraordinary social returns. This has been validated by extensive academic research and highlighted by leading policymakers. For example, according to the seminal High/Scope Perry Preschool Study, children who participate in highquality early education programs are more likely to read at grade level, thrive in school, and graduate than those who do not. They are also less likely to become involved with the justice system or need special instruction, which means that, according to University of Chicago economist and Nobel Laureate, James Heckman, every dollar invested in early childhood education produces a 10% annual return for the life of the child. During his February 13 State of the Union Address, President Obama cited such studies to underscore the powerful impact of investments in highquality early education.</p>





<p>There are two major problems when it comes to early education in Los Angeles: access and quality. Later in this proposal we discuss how we think that, together with the Goldhirsh Foundation, we can generate the political will to advance the issue of access for all children.</p>





<p>But universal access is not enough. Most children who attend preschool and whose parents are lowincome attend either federallyfunded Head Start preschools or statefunded preschools that are underresourced, and as a result have a lower level of quality. They have high childtoadult ratios and do not have as many books and learning resources as they should. In addition, low salaries compel many excellent preschool teachers to leave the profession to pursue careers that offer a living wage.</p>





<p>Our focus is on these children, who are in preschool, but need additional support to have experiences comparable to those that middleclass and affluent kids have. These children cannot wait for universal access; they need a firstclass education today. </p>





<p>Jumpstart is a remarkable publicprivate partnership that leverages the resources of government agencies, LAâ€™s leading foundations, cuttingedge corporations, universities, and preschools to provide highquality early education to children and families who need it most â€“ and it only costs $2,000 per child. Jumpstartâ€™s proposal is to implement one semester of the Jumpstart program in five Los Angeles preschool classrooms.</p>





<p>Hereâ€™s how it works.</p>





<p>Step 1: We identify preschools that serve children whose parents have lowincomes because we know that family income is a leading indicator of childrenâ€™s readiness for kindergarten. The lower your familyâ€™s income, the less likely you will be ready for school. Furthermore, children whose parents have a lowincome are more likely to attend schools that are illequipped to meet their needs.</p>





<p>Step 2: We collaborate with nearby universities. Why universities? Because universities have motivated, passionate students who have the capacity to give back.</p>





<p>Step 3: We train our collegestudent volunteers â€“ nearly 400 of them in LA County and 78 at UCLA â€“ to implement Jumpstartâ€™s highly intentional, researchbased program. Jumpstartâ€™s curriculum, which reflects best practices in early childhood education and has been informed by 20 years of experience â€“ is targeted to develop the language, literacy, and social skills that children need to begin kindergarten prepared to succeed. What else do we need besides a proven curriculum and talented adults with the time and motivation to help children?</p>





<p>Step 4: Money! Itâ€™s always time and money, isnâ€™t it? Through partnerships with AmeriCorps and the Federal Work Study program, we pay a significant portion of our program costs with dollars that have already been allocated to support college students â€“ and we maximize those public investments by putting those dollars where they can have the greatest impact: highquality early education.</p>


","<p>Jumpstart Los Angeles has achieved rapid growth over the past several years and become one of the leading early childhood organizations in the region. Since hiring our first executive director in 2009, we have grown from a small program serving fewer than 300 children to serve more than 1,200 children annually. Through partnerships with leading universities, early education providers, and school districts, along with support from the funding community, Jumpstart has quickly established a strong reputation in the community.</p>





<p>Jumpstartâ€™s program at UCLA, founded in 2009, is among our best and enjoys support among the schoolâ€™s faculty and administration. Now in its fourth year, Jumpstart at UCLA engages more than 70 college students each year. UCLA hosts two fulltime, paid Jumpstart staff members who work oncampus and have developed strong partnerships with leading early education providers, including Los Angeles Unified School District, Santa MonicaMalibu Unified School District, and Neighborhood Youth Association in Venice.</p>





<p>Nationwide, Jumpstart has trained more than 25,000 collegestudent and community volunteers to serve more than 100,000 preschool children in hundreds of early learning centers, and has been widely recognized as an innovative and impactful organization.</p>





<p>Jumpstartâ€™s program is a model in efficiency. As the organization has grown rapidly since its founding in 1993, Jumpstart has consistently decreased the cost per childserved hour from $35 to $7, a reduction of over twothirds in fewer than 10 years. The Stanford Social Innovation Review found that Jumpstart has reduced its costs by at least 6% annually, while simultaneously achieving substantial growth. Numerous organizations have recognized Jumpstart with awards that highlight its creative partnerships and effective programs:</p>





</p>â€¢ Alfred P Sloan Award for Workplace Flexibility and Effectiveness (2012)


â€¢ Independent Charities of America â€œBest in Americaâ€ seal (2012)


â€¢ Charity Navigatorâ€™s 4Star Rating for effectiveness, efficiency, and fiscal integrity (20062012)


â€¢ Cause Marketing Forumâ€™s Halo Award for Jumpstartâ€™s Read for the Record campaign (2007, 2009)


â€¢ AmeriCorps Spirit of Service Award (in conjunction with Pearson) (2008)


â€¢ Bank of Americaâ€™s Neighborhood Builder Award (2007)


â€¢ Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Partnership Award for CampusCommunity Collaboration (2007)


â€¢ Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropyâ€™s Directors Award (2004)


â€¢ Fast Company/Monitor Social Capitalist Award (every year since its inception in 2004)</p>","<p>We know we donâ€™t have all of the answers, so we work in concert with teachers, parents, and caregivers to ensure that we provide children with the best possible education.</p>





<p>We work with leading school districts and early education providers, which provide access to children and families in need and knowledge of the unique challenges faced by the young children whose lives we are seeking to alter.</p>





<p>Finally, we partner with UCLA and six other universities in LA County to implement the Jumpstart program. UCLA possesses a wealth of education expertise and talented, passionate students.</p>


","<p>Our mission is to work toward the day that every child in Los Angeles walks into their first day of kindergarten prepared to succeed, and everything we do is geared toward ensuring that the children who take part in our programs leave as prepared as possible.</p>





<p>We measure our success by the kindergarten readiness gains children make throughout the course of our program. We then compare these results to those of a comparison group of children from nearby neighborhoods. Weâ€™ve been doing this for ten years and the results speak for themselves.</p>





<p>Using Jumpstartâ€™s School Success Checklist, a sophisticated evaluation tool based on the best research in the field, we test children three times yearly against fifteen developmental metrics focused on language and literacy development. On average, children in Southern California make gains of more than 1.5 developmental levels throughout the course of the program. As a result, children who participate in the Jumpstart program have outperformed a comparison group in each of the ten years we have conducted such studies, and our results are strongest in Southern California.</p>





<p>Weâ€™re also sensitive to our communityâ€™s unique needs. You donâ€™t have to be a lifelong Angelino to know that our city is home to many children who speak a language other than English at home. In fact, more than half of the children we serve in Los Angeles and nearly a third of all students enrolled in Los Angeles Unified School District are English language learners.</p>





<p>We also know that the early years are particularly important for this population of students, so weâ€™ve been segmenting our results by language spoken at home for the past two years â€“ and the results have been eyeopening.</p>





<p>Each year, children who spoke Spanish only or English and Spanish at home started the program well behind Englishonly speakers. By the end of the program, however, Spanishonly speakers had narrowed the achievement gap significantly and bilingual ELLs finished the program year ahead of their Englishonly counterparts. This year, we will conduct a research project to delve deeper into our success educating ELLs.</p>





<p>The college students who take part in Jumpstart benefit tremendously as well. We pre and posttest all of our collegestudent volunteers and have found that Jumpstart increases their leadership skills; helps them succeed academically; and inspires many of them to pursue careers in teaching and service.</p>





<p>For example, last year more than twothirds of Jumpstartâ€™s volunteers at UCLA reported that the program helped them succeed academically. At the same time, more than half of our volunteers intended to pursue a career in teaching, most of them at the early childhood level. Inspiring young people at great schools like UCLA to pursue careers in early education is another way that we work toward our mission of ensuring that every child enters kindergarten prepared to succeed.</p>


","<p>The benefits of our project are both shortterm and longterm for Jumpstart children and families, as well as the Los Angeles community. </p>





<p>In the shortterm, the children we serve will get the type of education that wealthier kids get, laying a foundation for success throughout the rest of their lives. One hundred children will benefit from Jumpstartâ€™s intensive program, designed to promote the language, literacy and social development that children need to succeed. The cornerstone of the Jumpstart program is the Jumpstart session, a 2hour period during the school day in which our volunteers lead a series of highlyintentional, structured activities that develop childrenâ€™s vocabularies, promote their oral language skills, and introduce them to fundamental concepts across a range of subjects that they will need to understand in order to begin kindergarten prepared.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, the communities we serve will also benefit from the books and resources that Jumpstart provides â€“ both in the classrooms it serves and in the homes of children and families. By hosting literacythemed events in the community and through regular communication with parents and caregivers, we will also share strategies for how to incorporate learning and literacy into everyday life.</p>





<p>In the longterm, given the extraordinary returns of investments in early education, the children we serve today will live healthier, more fulfilling lives and Los Angeles will derive the ensuing social and economic benefits.</p>





<p>But, by partnering with you, we have a chance to attack the problems of both access and quality. Providing disadvantaged children with an excellent early education experience is the best way to get Los Angeles where it needs to be. However, despite what the Los Angeles 2050 Report calls an â€œobvious payback on investment,â€ early education does not receive the funding it needs and is perpetually in danger of being cut. For example, according to ECEWORKS!, a project of First 5 Los Angeles, â€œ90% of brain development happens before the fifth birthday. [But] over 95% of education dollars are spent on programs for kids older than five.â€</p>





<p>The challenge is to generate support for the importance of both greater access and higher quality early education experiences for disadvantaged children in Los Angeles. Jumpstart and the Goldhirsh Foundation are natural partners in this endeavor. Jumpstart possesses immense knowledge about early education and child development, a proven program, and partnerships with many of LAâ€™s leading universities and early education providers. Meanwhile, the Goldhirsh Foundation has earned a reputation as an innovative grant maker and convener. Most importantly, the Goldhirsh Foundation has the platform to broadcast our work together, mobilize support for early education, and work with community leaders to develop a collective impact approach to addressing this problem, which is at the root of so many others.</p> ","<p>If you attended a wellresourced preschool as a child, then success in the year 2050 will look a lot like you. One hundred children will have received a semester of highquality early education and, as a result, they are more likely to have gone on to graduate from high school, attend college, and live healthy, productive lives. There is overwhelming evidence that highquality early education has this kind of impact, and that, as a result, society as a whole benefits from having better citizens, smarter workers, and stronger families.</p>





<p>More broadly, success in 2050 would look like a Los Angeles in which access to highquality early education is universal. Every family would have the opportunity to enroll their child in a preschool equipped to provide them with the skills they need to walk into their first day of kindergarten prepared to succeed.</p>





<p>The first step toward this goal is to provide every child with access to preschool. This is an imperative that enjoys broad support among economists and policymakers who have looked at the evidence, including President Obama. </p>





<p>According to the Goldhirsh Foundationâ€™s LA 2050 Report, â€œIn Los Angeles County, less than onefifth of preschool aged children are enrolled in early education programs,â€ depriving thousands of children opportunities to narrow the achievement gap that has already developed between themselves and their more affluent peers. Without these opportunities, children are falling behind every day and, in many cases, struggling to catch up for the rest of their lives.</p>





<p>The good news is that it is possible for all children to receive a highquality preschool education. We know what skills children need to acquire during the preschool years and we know how to develop them. We also know that there is no better investment in economy, our community, and our children than universal, highquality preschool education. Investments in the early years will lead to better life outcomes for individuals and better economic and social outcomes for our community.</p>





<p>All we need is your support. </p>

3102133,2013133,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/youthvoicesmobile.html,Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom, Education,"How do we reach and connect students to their personal and community history, and social science and civic engagement issues, while also providing new media production skills that give them access to the global digital culture and economy? The answer is the Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom, a popup classroom that will serve local schools and community events with multimedia tools and digital literacy training.





Departures Youth Voices is a multimedia literacy program for high school students that offers a structured learning experience in the history, geography, and sociopolitical issues of their community. 





Through a series of 11 workshops, Youth Voices students are exposed to digital and multimedia tools (audio, photography,video), storytelling techniques, creative mapping strategies, and a brief history of collage art and muralism. Students are encouraged to utilize these new skills to become content producers  researching the people, places and stories of their community to create multimedia stories that will introduce and guide visitors through key locations in their neighborhood. Finally, they learn to employ social networking strategies to promote and share their productions and receive feedback from their peers. 





The Departures Youth Voices curriculum meets and/or addresses several of the California Common Core Content Standards, as well as build key foundational skills in the new media literacies both of which are essential for students to succeed in the 21st century classroom and in the quickly evolving workforce.





The Mobile Classroom will deploy the Departures Youth Voices program at schools, youth organizations and events. Equipped with chairs and tables, cameras, editing equipment, and wifi capabilities, the Mobile Classroom is a fully functioning digital lab (housed inside a converted bus or trailer) that allows students to participate in Youth Voices workshops in a controlled and formal classroom environment, even in the most informal settings such as outdoor community events. This will allow us to provide either the full media literacy curriculum, or a single curated workshop specifically chosen for each location. 





The Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom will extend the reach of Departures Youth Voices to schools and youth organizations that have limited or no technical resources. In addition, it will allow us to reach more educators with our professional development workshops, providing an introduction to media literacy, connected learning, and a step by step training on implementing Youth Voices in their classroom, increasing the sustainability of the program.","In the past five years Departures Youth Voices has worked with almost 200 students in schools and organizations throughout Southern California. These include the L.A. Leadership Academy in Lincoln Heights in an exploration of the L.A. River; the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale to uncover the social history of Compton's Richland Farms; Venice High School to examine the myth and reality of Venice; the Chinatown Service Centerâ€™s Youth Council to highlight the rich and diverse history of Chinatown, and Franklin High School to share the stories of the people, places and historical events that have shaped Highland Park.





The awardwinning Youth Voices program is a vital outreach component of KCETâ€™s Departures, a multimedia documentary series, community engagement tool, and digital literacy project that explores the social and cultural vitality of Los Angelesâ€™ diverse neighborhoods. Departures has received funding from nonprofits and public and private agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adobe Youth Voices, Boeing, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, and the California Council for the Humanities.





An important aspect of Departures Youth Voices is our website, where we have built an archive of all student generated media from each of our neighborhood documentaries. The Youth Voices Curriculum can be accessed through our website, allowing educators and youth advocates open source access to our lesson plans. 





Specific achievements include when students from the L.A. Leadership Academy were selected to perform their songs and poetry at â€œCorrido of Los Angeles,â€ an event celebrating the bicentennial of the Mexican Revolution at the L.A. County Museum of Art. In the winning entries the students positioned themselves as agents of change in their neighborhood, working as a team looking to reclaim the streets and make them a better place.


 


Another student producer, Mo Rahman, traveled to Washington, D.C. and took part in a panel discussion at the Silverdocs Festival where he shared his Youth Voices experience.  He presented student produced work from the L.A. River installment, and discussed how the skills he learned offered new opportunities for his future. He, along with several other Youth Voices student producers, have continued their study of media, while others have had an opportunity to intern at KCET Departures.





An ongoing example of our achievements is how our work is advancing and evolving. Currently we are continuing our collaboration with The L.A. Leadership Academy, and developing new partnerships with two newlyestablished schools: ArtLAB and The L.A. River School at the Sotomayor Learning Academies in Glassell Park. 





In addition Departures Youth Voices has partnered with The HeArt Project, a nonprofit arts organization that has been utilizing the Youth Voices curriculum to engage students at L.A.area alternative and continuation schools through the arts.","In 2013 we will cultivate partnerships with schools and organizations in communities along the Los Angeles River and the San Gabriel River, and South L.A.â€™s Leimert Park. Currently the Youth Voices curriculum is being taught at three high schools in Northeast Los Angeles as part of the community outreach efforts of the Northeast Los Angeles Riverfront Collaborative, a project set to run through 2014.





The Mobile Classroom will allow Youth Voices to establish new partnerships as well as nurture existing partnerships. We will continue to work with The HeArt Project, as well as the Los Angeles Leadership Academy and The Sotomayor Learning Academies. We will also reengage â€œalumniâ€ programs with past participating schools. ","The Departures Youth Voices Mobile Classroom will be evaluated through surveys, and short and long term assessment markers. 





Short term markers include: increased number of students and educators participating in Youth Voices; the objectives and the goals of the program being met by more student producers; and more educators implementing and sustaining the program on their own. 





Long term markersincreased academic achievement, graduation rates and college entrywill be more difficult to track, but necessary to establish the overarching benefits of the direct delivery of the media literacy curriculum. We will work with our educational partners to develop an effective system to follow the progress of participating students. 





We will also track the ease and interest in replicating this model of a mobile media literacy classroom locally and nationally.





The program will implement an established pre and post evaluation with participating students. A questionnaire is given to the students to identify their digital capabilities, from their confidence in multimedia equipment, to their knowledge of community history, geography, civic engagement and life skills. The questionnaire influences the speed at which the curricula is imparted to the students and informs where expansion or reduction of particular elements in the curricula are needed. 





The onsite educator is encouraged to share their experiences and provide an ongoing evaluation of  the program on the Education Notes Blog on the Youth Voices website. The blog helps to mediate between plan and reality by looking at the weekly workshops from the educatorâ€™s perspective. They write about how the implementation of the program is functioning, the successes, challenges and best practices that are emerging.





At the end of the eleven workshops a postassessment questionnaire is given to the students to identify if their media literacy skills, digital capabilities, and knowledge about their community has increased, and how they plan on using this new knowledge and skills.  This allows us to see where the program was successful and where it needs to be refined.  A post evaluation is also offered to the onsite educator in an effort to gain more of their insight on the program, the students participation and the likelihood of sustaining the program on their own. 


","According to the LA2050 Report, education in Los Angeles is â€œa significant impediment to human development.â€ A harsh reality for the almost 2 million students in L.A. County. The facts are abundantly clear that a high percentage of students are not receiving the kind of education that engages and nurtures their interests, or offered the support they need to identify and connect their interests to academic success and career opportunities. This is one reason for the large number of disengaged students and dropouts (i.e. lost students) in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD.)





Departures Youth Voices knits together these crucial elements in its media literacy curriculum. The program uses digital media as an engagement and creative tool that empowers todayâ€™s youth to become civically engaged and active participants in their community. The development and launch of the Youth Voices Mobile Classroom will increase the number of participating students from schools and organizations lacking in digital media resources. 





Youth Voices students will gain access and insight into the new 21st century digital culture and economy, in which Los Angeles plays a major role. They will become prepared for an increasingly mediacentric higher education programs in the world class universities and colleges in the Los Angeles area, as well as for taking on multiple roles in the growing media and technology industries in the city.


","In just 37 years we will arrive at 2050.  Life, ideas, and technology are moving at quicksilver speed, so we must act fast to ensure that changes are made to the education system and students are encouraged to be active participants in their own education, able to define their own paths to success with the support and resources provided by their schools. Taking a cue from â€œLiteracy in the 21st Century,â€ greater achievements by students will occur when schools and classrooms are transformed from storehouses of knowledge into gathering places for students and teachers to explore, to question, to experiment, and to discover.  





In order to achieve this ideal by 2050, media literacy will become a fundamental component of the educational system from K12.  Students will be given broader opportunities to develop a wider set of literacy skills to both interpret the messages being received and effectively utilize these tools to become content creators and distribute their own messages. 





This process will foster students who are critical thinkers, contributing members of a more engaged and active citizenry capable of analyzing, evaluating, and communicating messages in all aspects of public life.

The goals of Ground Game are 3fold: to further engage civicminded citizens; to provide easy entre for individuals who have not yet engaged in civic activities; and to foster volunteerism that will advance the goals of nonprofit organizations and, at the same time, open avenues for participation to individuals. 





BACKGROUND


Beginning with the 2012 election cycle, Ballot Brief brought L.A. voters information that went beyond the headlines, allowing them to dig deeper with explainers, helpful guides, and cheat sheets of Citywide propositions. Coverage went beyond â€œhorseraceâ€ politics to include important information on the issues through regular online stories and segments on KCETâ€™s daily television program SoCal Connected. Most importantly, Ballot Brief brought voters transparency behind proposition campaign financing.  By developing unique â€œwhose funding whomâ€ databases, Ballot Brief brought to light data that is theoretically public, but is difficult to understand because of the complicated way it is accessed and presented. 





From the moment Ballot Brief coverage began, KCET website traffic saw immediate and exponential growth, garnering a total of 2.5 million page views, 900,000 of them on Election Day, leading to a 5,900 percent increase in average daily website traffic. During the months leading up to the election, the majority of Ballot Briefâ€™s proposition coverage â€“ the cheat sheets and funding databases  were ranked on the first page of Google search results. Major media outlets throughout the U.S. referenced Ballot Brief in their own election coverage. 





PROJECT OVERVIEW


Ground Game will expand the potential of Ballot Brief beyond election cycles by working yearround to build civic engagement in the Cityâ€™s most disengaged precincts.  Through a targeted, ground level informational campaign focused on precincts with low voter turnout and by utilizing bilingual grassroots and guerilla marketing methods, social media marketing, and word of mouth marketing in collaboration with communitybased nonprofitâ€™s, Ground Game will acknowledge, empower, educate, encourage, and engage individuals in Los Angeles.  





By connecting with people on a deeply personal level, â€œWhatâ€™s your gripe?,â€ we will plant the seed of engagement. After all, we all have grievancesrich, poor, regardless of cultural differenceswe are in this together; we are a community.  The Ground Game website will foster empowerment by providing an easy way to express the grievance and will educate people by connecting them, based on their street address, to their elected officials voting records and providing more in depth information on the subject, and lastly, Ground Game will make the connection between personal gripe and civic engagement by revealing volunteer opportunities within communitybased groups.


","Since 1964, KCET has served Los Angeles and an 11county region of Southern and Central California.  We reach one of the most diverse market areas in the country with the finest regional, national and international programming, as well as with educational resources and community events.





In October 2012, KCET announced a merger with San Franciscobased Link Media, an awardwinning national media organization focused on global news and culture.  With the new name of KCETLink, our merged organization is poised to introduce an entirely new model for independent public media that represents the future of the industry â€“ driving digital innovation, creating sustainable growth and serving the public interest.  Utilizing multiple onair, online and mobile distribution platforms, KCETLink will have a greater capacity to address key issues in our local communities, as well as across the nation and around the world.





Over the years, KCET programming has received numerous awards:





Ballot Brief was launched in 2012 and met with tremendous success as discussed above.





Our weekly news program, SoCal Connected, has been recognized with several of the highest honors in broadcasting, including the George Foster Peabody Award; two Alfred I. duPontColumbia University Awards; and 17 Los Angeles Area Emmys Awards, among others.

3102136,2013136,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Youth4CLeaders.html,LA2050 Youth 4C Leaders, Social Connectedness,"Only 7% of Los Angelenos have reported contacting a public official. 37% of Los Angelenos donâ€™t even discuss politics at all. Even more troubling, is that not even 1 out of 12 citizens with less than a high school education will vote in a Presidential election. With voter turnout correlated to education levels, Los Angeles is losing the voice of an entire segment of people.


<br /><br />


LA2050 Youth 4C will remove barriers that prevent civic engagement by going directly into alternative education charter schools in underserved communities to train students as grassroots leaders and advocates for community change.  Over 70 students from 7 different areas in Los Angeles will be given the training and tools needed to effectively engage their peers and parents to have a voice in policy by leading campaigns in their own schools and communities.  The LA2050 Youth 4C Leaders will mobilize thousands of individuals to participate in civic engagement, and for many, provide them their first experience in politics. 


<br /><br />


The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative brings forward a new uprising of young leaders to encourage civic engagement today and help change the culture of participation for the future. The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative is a  6month training program that is comprised of 5 components: 1) the development and implementation of a minicampaign at each of the seven schools; 2) production of a LA2050 Youth 4C YouTube channel that documents and share the videos of hundreds of youth discussing the issues they face;  3) a collaboration of the Youth 4C Leaders to plan and host a Back to School Conference for 2000 area students, 4) educate and engage parents at Open House sessions, and 5) leading a LA2050 Youth 4C Advocacy Day at City Hall. 


<br /><br />


Youth 4C will partner with alternative charter schools to identify and recruit 710 student leaders from each of the following areas: Compton, Huntington Park, Watts, Culver City, East LA, Hoover, & Hawthorne. Each group of student leaders will work as a team to develop and implement a minicampaign at their school that focuses on one policy issue that affects their lives as students. Topics can include but are not limited to gang violence, teen pregnancy, foster care, substance abuse, access to resources, or bullying.  All students will come together for monthly trainings in leadership, community organizing, and advocacy, as well as to provide a forum for discussion and support for each otherâ€™s campaigns. 


<br /><br />


After months of planning, Youth 4C Leaders will introduce their campaign at a Back to School Conference of 2000 area students. Each Youth 4C Leadership team will present their campaign to the entire conference. Each leadership team will also have a booth at the conference, allowing students to talk one on one about the issue, share campaign messages, and have supporters sign their petitions. 


Over the next two months, each student leadership group will embark on a community campaign at their school to gain support, have petitions signed, and to create Video Voice Mapping footage. Video Voice Mapping (VVM) is a new advocacy tool where students record themselves performing selfinterviews that discusses where there are, an environmental or policy issue that is affecting them, and what they would like done about it. All videos will be placed on a newly created LA2050 Youth 4C YouTube channel that can be promoted throughout Los Angeles. Each Youth 4C Leader will perform their own VVM Interview and be responsible for interviewing 5 other students or community members. Students will also engage parents at Open House sessions, where parents will be invited to sign petitions and participate in video interviews. 


<br /><br />


As a capstone of the campaign, the student leaders will plan and host a LA2050 Youth 4C Advocacy Day at City Hall.  Student leaders, friends, family members, and community supporters will come together on the steps of City Hall to show support for the future of social connectedness and civic engagement in LA. The student groups will announce the success of their project, the number of petitions that were signed, and show some of their favorite and most powerful VVM interviews. After the press conference, students will meet one on one will government officials to share their campaign. 


","Youth 4C is a new project launched in 2013 by two young Los Angeles entrepreneurs. Having both grown up outside of Los Angeles, both Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne noticed the lack of social connectedness and civic engagement among youth in L.A. , particularly among underserved communities. As a response to this, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne launched Youth 4C, a new initiative aimed at increasing leadership, advocacy, and volunteerism among youth. Instead of just focusing on preparing youth as the next generation of leaders, Youth 4C recognizes youth as the leaders of today that are capable of advocating and organizing for change in their communities. 


<br /><br />


Youth 4C is a dynamic and rapidly growing initiative that already has two projects underway in the first few months of launching. Youth 4C has developed an entrepreneur curriculum for children aged 715 that will be implemented this summer at Los Angeles City College. Youth 4C has also partnered with the College of the Bahamas to develop and lead an international youth summit that will bring together youth from urban and rural areas to tackle top issues affecting their futures. 


<br /><br />


Prior to launching Youth 4C, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne both came from nonprofit and government relations backgrounds. Keely Hopkins, a government relations attorney and development specialist, has led statewide political campaigns, advocated on behalf of nonprofits before state legislatures, and has led youth advocacy trainings in South Los Angeles. Samuel Alleyne, who specializes in project management and development strategy, comes from an extensive background in youth leadership and engagement.  Samuel has served as a project coordinator the California Department of Public Health, has organized and led international youth campaigns, and has taught youth leadership and entrepreneurial classes at CSU and LACC. 


","The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative will be partnering with 7 alternative education charter schools located in Compton, Watts, Huntington Park, Culver City, Hawthorne, East LA and Hoover.  


<br /><br />


The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative will also collaborate with elected officials, government offices, and community leaders in the aforementioned areas to gain support for the youth campaigns and to assist in planning the LA2050 Youth 4C Advocacy Summit at City Hall.


<br /><br />


Educators, motivational speakers, and media personalities will also be brought in for the monthly leadership trainings and Back to School Conference. 


","The LA2050 Youth4C Initiative will be evaluated by the number of student leaders trained, the total number of individuals engaged by the campaigns, and the quality of the program. 


<br /><br />


Youth 4C Program Directors will be responsible for collecting data and maintaining a matrix that tracks each student leaderâ€™s monthly participation in leadership trainings and all scheduled activities. The Program Directors will also be responsible for collecting data from student leaders on a monthly basis that tracks the number of petitions signed and VVM interviews conducted. This information will be analyzed by the Program Directors to ensure the outreach numbers are being met and students are on track to reach goal numbers for petition signatures and video interviews.  


<br /><br />


The quality of the program will be evaluated throughout student surveys issued at the start and end of the program, as well as by monthly interviews with educator liaisons from each school. The student surveys will include questions regarding knowledge of the political process, experience in civic engagement and community organizing, and comfort levels of expressing their voice on policy issues. The monthly interviews with educator liaisons from each school will discuss the awareness levels for the campaigns, the excitement generated by the student leaders, the response of parents at the Open House, and student attitudes towards political involvement. The Program Directors will compile the survey and interview results to determine impact and success of the program. 


<br /><br />


Using both quantitative and qualitative information, monthly summative reports will be prepared by the Program Directors and examined. Based on the results of the report, the Program Directors will adjust the program operationally as well as implement strategies to strengthen the program. 


","By focusing on students in alternative education high schools, Youth 4C will intercept a segment of society that is on track to become inactive participants of democracy. Students in alternative schools regularly enroll in these charter schools after struggling in a traditional school setting, and are up against the high dropout rate that faces students in underserved communities. Often from backgrounds that include poverty, incarcerated parents, and gang violence, these students are most at risk to become part of the statistic that only one out of every twelve individuals with less than a high school education will vote in a Presidential election. 





The LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative pushes education levels aside and brings forward 70100 grassroots leaders to pave the path for their community to have an active future in social and civic engagement. Barriers and misconceptions about politics and advocacy will be broken down by illustrating that small  steps, such as signing a petition or being involved in a student group, can make a difference in your community and your city.  At the end of the project, the LA2050 Youth 4C Initiative will have impacted thousands of students and parents in communities with low voter turnout, low levels of civic participation, and low levels of political discussion. 





The Youth 4C Initiative aims to have the following impact on Los Angeles: 1) 70100 youth grassroots leaders from underserved communities trained, 2) 2000 students engaged in an issue advocacy campaign, 3) 1000 parents engaged in an issue advocacy campaign, 4) 500 students and communities members at Youth Advocacy Summit to show Los Angeles there is a future for social connectedness, and 5) a new mindset in these communities that anyone can take action and get involved. 


","Success in 2050 will look like a new generation of leaders that have changed the culture around civic engagement and social connectedness. The youth of today will have grown up as active citizens that are not afraid to voice their opinion, contact public officials, or participate in voting. Along the way, the youth of today will have encouraged those around them to be more involved in their schools, in their communities, and then in their workplace. In 2050, the youth of today will be raising the next generation of active citizens and imparting to them the new culture of participation. "

2) Changes in academic interest of all youth at their respective elementary, middle and high schools.


3) College admissions for highschool youth.


4) Jobs and income levels achieved by participants as students and later as professionals.





The performance of participants will be tracked for at least five years following program graduation. ","Our proposed program aims to keep Los Angeles competitive within technologybased sectors and industries by fostering a skilled, educated group of lowincome youth currently living in public housing communities.

Rather, we see the true achievement gap as the difference in college graduation rates among these populations. Highincome students graduate college at ten times the rate of lowincome students  80% versus 8% on average. At KIPP LA, we are committed to supporting both our current students and our alumni on their journey <b>to and through</b> college. We seek to create and build partnerships that will support our students as they transition from our schools at the end of 8th grade to highperforming high schools and on to selective colleges.</br></br>KIPP LA's KIPP Through College (KTC) program does just that by providing oneonone support to our alumni as they enter high school, apply to college, and make their way through higher education and the workforce. KTC team members ensure that KIPP LA's 8th graders matriculate to a highperforming college preparatory high school that will prepare them for success in college. KTC's high school placement coordinators travel among our middle school sites to support our existing 360 7th and 8th grade students. Our students receive personalized assistance with high school selection and applications, financial aid and scholarships, and the high school transition process. In 2012, KIPP LA placed 96% of our 8th grade students in collegepreparatory charter, magnet, independent day, parochial, and boarding schools.</br></br>From there, KTC stays with our students throughout high school, providing help with coursework selection, college planning services, and individual and family counseling. As our alumni approach high school graduation, KTC staff support them as they identify and apply to colleges, seek financial aid, and prepare to enter the college environment. Once our alumni are in college, KTC college retention advisors provide the necessary support services to see our alumni through college graduation. This includes making site visits whenever possible, sending care packages, providing academic support, helping students secure study abroad opportunities, and assisting with the community college and university transfer process if necessary.</br></br>KTC also strives to prepare our students for their future careers and instill an understanding of and excitement for these goals. This preparation may include a range of mentoringbased activities, such as summer internships, work study programs, resume writing, and interview workshops with career mentors, organizations and community allies.</br></br>In addition to personalized services, KTC hosts an annual high school fair for our students, gathering representatives from Los Angeles' highest performing high schools to answer enrollment questions. KTC also hosts a ""Mocktail Party"" for our alumni, providing an opportunity to practice networking and share their future ambitions with career professionals. Further, the KTC team leads college visits for our alumni to competitive schools across the country, and operates a 12th Grade Application Bootcamp that provides intensive support with college applications. Finally, KTC provides college scholarships to students with high academic potential, a strong record of community service, and demonstrated financial need. KIPP LA believes that this unique program serves as a model for others working to help students from underserved communities earn college degrees and lead fulfilling lives.</br></br>The KTC team is comprised of a director, three college access advisors, one college retention advisor, and two high school placement coordinators. Each KTC team member has a deep commitment to helping underserved students succeed in high school, college, and the competitive world beyond. Now in its third year, KTC has established a proven track record of success in preparing KIPP LA alumni for their journey to and through college.</br></br>Currently, KTC serves approximately 740 KIPP LA alumni, of which 520 are in high school and 220 are persisting in college. Our alumni are spread across 140 high schools that KTC staff have deemed to provide a rigorous and collegepreparatory education. Additionally, nearly 85% of our oldest alumni cohorts, the Classes of 2011 and 2012, are enrolled in 81 colleges and universities across the country. Next year, KTC will serve 910 alumni, including 540 high school students and 370 college students.</br></br>With the unwavering support of KIPP LAâ€™s KTC program, 84% of our alumni are persisting in college, whereas in South and East Los Angeles, only 4% of students graduate college. As KTC continues to serve more KIPP LA alumni, we anticipate that we will increase the number of college graduates in these neighborhoods by 50%.  In the long term, this will mean dramatic increases in academic attainment in some of Los Angelesâ€™ most underserved communities.","If it were a district, KIPP LA would be the highest performing in Los Angeles County serving a majority of students from lowincome communities.  For nearly a decade, KIPP LAâ€™s schools have been proving what is possible in raising student achievement in traditionally underserved lowincome communities. In 201112, KIPP LAâ€™s weighted average Academic Performance Index (API) score was 892 (800 is the statewide goal), compared to 700 in the neighboring schools of South and East Los Angeles. KIPP LA Prep, in Boyle Heights, is the highestperforming middle school in Los Angeles Unified School District for the second year in a row with an API of 924. Similarly, KIPP RaÃ­ces Academy, in East LA, outperforms 98 percent of elementary schools in California with an API of 961. According to the national normreferenced SAT10 test, 96 percent of KIPP LAâ€™s kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or above the national average in English language arts. Finally, 96 percent of KIPP LA alumni are attending highperforming, collegeprep high schools, and nearly 85 percent are currently enrolled in college.","KIPP LA and the KTC team work closely with high schools, colleges, and universities that our alumni attend to ensure that they are succeeding on their journeys to and through college. KTC is also working to formalize these partnerships with select local institutions of higher education to create supportive communities for our alumni. In the long term, we believe college partnerships will identify strategies that educational institutions can implement to help close the achievement gap for all students of color and firstgeneration college students.","A key ingredient to KIPP LAâ€™s success is our commitment to datadriven decisionmaking and transparency. The KTC team regularly evaluates both quantitative and qualitative data to ensure that we are having the greatest impact possible on our studentsâ€™ lives. This includes the number of students who matriculate to highperforming high schools, the number of students who participate in KTC support services such as financial aid assistance and counseling, and the number of students who enter, persist in, and graduate from selective colleges and universities.</br></br>In the coming year, KIPP LA and KTC will strive to meet the following goals and objectives:</br></br>


â€¢  Each year, KIPP LAâ€™s middle schools will place 95 percent of eighth graders in collegepreparatory high schools (high schools that provide college counseling for all students, offer the â€œAGâ€ courses the University of California requires, and have an Academic Performance Index score of 800+).</br>


â€¢  At least 80 percent of KIPP LA middle school alumni will enroll in college each year.</br>


â€¢  At least 10 percent of KIPP LA alumni in grades 912 will attend a summer or enrichment program.</br>


â€¢  At least 15 percent of KIPP LA alumni in grades 912 will participate in KTC enrichment programs, (such as the alumni volunteer program, internship program, job shadowing, career networking party, college partnership summer programs, college tours/fairs, and application boot camps).</br>


â€¢  At least 80 percent of KIPP LA alumni will persist in college. ","The neighborhoods of South and East Los Angeles, where KIPP LA students and alumni live, face astonishingly high levels of illiteracy, drug abuse, gang violence, and juvenile crime. Schools are overcrowded and underperforming; virtually all traditional public middle and high schools are failing according to No Child Left Behind. Overall, fewer than 10 percent of students in these neighborhoods attend a fouryear college or university after graduating high school and only 4 percent go on to obtain a degree.</br></br>Today more than ever, students in underserved communities need an outstanding education to prepare them for success in life and to overcome the cycle of poverty. Research suggests that by 2018, 63 percent of jobs will require some higher education. By comparison, only 36 percent of jobs will be available to those with a high school degree or lower, leaving those without higher degrees access to even fewer jobs than they have today. Over the course of a lifetime, college graduates will earn on average $1.6 million more than those without a degree.</br></br>Unfortunately, the youth of South and East Los Angeles are highly unlikely to graduate high school collegeready or go on to graduate college. According to The Education Trust West, only 22 percent of LAUSD students graduate with the requirements necessary to enroll in a University of California institution. This is the case for only 16 percent of Latino students. Research suggests that just over half of these students will matriculate to college and only 41 percent of them will graduate. Based on these figures, we estimate that only 4 percent of students in South and East Los Angeles actually obtain a college degree within six years.</br></br>KIPP LA, on the other hand, is succeeding at helping students from underserved communities â€œclimb the mountainâ€ to and through college. With the unwavering support of KIPP LAâ€™s KTC team, 96 percent of our alumni are attending 140 highperforming, collegeprep high schools, and nearly 85 percent are currently attending over 80 colleges and universities across the country. We foresee that our alumni â€“ as selfdirected, purposeful college graduates â€“ will also work to improve educational and economic opportunities across Los Angeles. This will mean stronger economic outcomes, such as lifetime earnings and employment rates, in the cityâ€™s currently most underserved areas. Thus, supporting KIPP LA is not only an investment in underserved studentsâ€™ education and preparation for college; it is an investment in the future of our city and country. ","In 2050, success in education would mean that every student in Los Angeles, regardless of their zip code or demographics, attends a highquality, collegepreparatory school from kindergarten through 12th grade. Ultimately, all students in Los Angeles will never face the achievement gap and will be instilled with the belief that every day they can and <b>will</b> succeed in college and life. Classrooms will reflect the 21st century reality of the global workforce, preparing students for careers that may not yet exist through constant access to technology, projectbased learning, and opportunities for critical thinking and creative problem solving.</br></br>Teachers will be dedicated to and passionate about their craft, providing a nurturing and rigorous learning environment for their students. Schools will become true communities of best practice, sharing lessons learned and helping improve the quality of education across the city. School leaders will be empowered as instructional leaders to build their schools to best align with the communities and students they serve.</br></br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, students from underserved communities will matriculate to and graduate from competitive colleges and universities both in California and across the nation at the same rates as their more advantaged peers. They will enter the college application process without reservations, certain that they are prepared for the rigors and challenges of higher education. They will be educated about the financial aid options available to them and able to access them easily. They will be accepted to a wide variety of schools and will have the freedom to choose the one that will provide them with the best opportunities. And ultimately, all students will have a high quality, rigorous higher education experience and graduate with the degrees they need to succeed in the competitive world."
3102139,2013139,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/C-360.html,Collaborative 360 â€“ Creating Successful Pathways to 2050, Public Safety,"As an organization that has aided in securing over $10 million in funding for global projects 2) developed more than 600 businesses and nonprofits â€“ boosting employment while implementing services 3) aided in feeding more than 15,000 children and families 4) facilitated free business development workshops for thousands, creating opportunities for business growth, and 5) helped to establish afterschool programs for hundreds of disadvantaged youth; the Kreative Images Foundation (K.I.) is honing our focus to specifically impact South Los Angeles communities through the Collaborative 360 Project.





What is Collaboration?  





1)  The Merriam Webster definition  states . . . Collaboration means to cooperate with an agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected 


2)  Wikipediaâ€™s definition says . . . Collaboration is working together to achieve a goal; working together to realize shared goals; a collective, determination to reach an identical objective; sharing knowledge, learning and building consensus.


3)  Dictionary.com explains . . . Collaboration is the act of working with another or others on a joint project, or something created by working jointly with another or others





What is Collaborative 360 (C360)?





For Collaborative 360 (C360), Collaboration means, effectively forming vital relationships with those in South Los Angeles and beyond that will collectively work toward the greater good of others; thereby through joint efforts, C360 will offer fullcircle, wraparound services to address community needs.   C360 is designed for local businesses, community organizations, churches and residents to cooperatively implement strategies that ultimately create selfsustaining, healthy communities.   These joint alliances will produce extensive, longterm outcomes, i.e., reduction in crime, improved community relations, enhanced literacy scores, business creation, and enhanced employment opportunities, just to name a few.





Preventing Valuable Economic Leakage by Plugging in the Gaps





In order for any community to gain and sustain its most valuable asset (people), there must be services, solutions and economic wealth that exist.  Without them, the outflow turns into a steady stream of job reduction, high crime, loss of businesses, etc.; resulting in whatâ€™s called whiteflight (the departure of whites or wealthier populations).  This deficiency of people and resources leaves lowincome minority populations to dwell among lowproducing schools, substandard housing, blighted businesses and more.





Stopping the Ripple Effect of Community Deprivation â€“ In order to build healthy sustainable communities, thereby a healthy LA by 2050, itâ€™s important that we uplift and empower â€œallâ€ Angelinos; while also attracting and retaining the powerful minds and creative individuals that are so much a part of our opulently diverse, cultural lining (USC and UCLA students, visiting tourist contemplating relocation and others); including reigniting the passion and interest of current residents that are contemplating moving away.





In order for C360 to have an impact and promote sustainability communities, we must first understand why people either remain or move from a community.  The U.S. Census Bureau announced that among those who moved between 2009 and 2010, more than four out of 10 (16.4 million or 43.7 percent) did so for desirable housing and community related reasons, such as the desire live in cleaner, safer communities.





In an effort to create safe, livable communities, C360 will focus on forming alliances (crossing business sectors, industries and community programs), in our target areas to crosscollaborate and create sustainable strategies for success.





We have experienced major success in helping organizations and businesses cross collaborate in ways that are seldom considered before:





â€¢        Teaching strategies to forprofits and nonprofits to collaborate for business sustainability while aiding community residents; i.e., showing a struggling plumber how he can work with a nonprofit job training program (plumbing apprentice program) and provide needed services to lowincome families, seniors, the disabled, etc.


â€¢        Linking child care centers with yoga instructors, because studies have shown that toddlers are entering kindergarten with the stress levels of 9th graders


â€¢        Helping mental health professionals form nonprofits to aid individuals that otherwise could not receive their services; with a goal to prevent instances like the senseless killings of Newton, Connecticut; Columbine; the Aurora, CO theater shootings and more.


","The founder of C360, Sherita J. Herring, and the Kreative Images Foundation (K.I.) is equipped with the experience, contacts and professional acumen to produce the stated deliverables of the C360 project.  For more than 25 years Ms. Herring and the K.I. Foundation has spearheaded positive change by 1) aiding organizations in securing millions in funding 2) developed more than 600 businesses and nonprofits â€“ boosting the job market while implementing services 3) aided in forming programs that have fed more than 15,000 children and families 4) facilitated free business development workshops for thousands, creating opportunities for business growth, and 5) helped to establish afterschool programs for hundreds of disadvantaged youth, and so much more.   Additionally, Sherita recently served as the Community Outreach Project Manager on a $14 million dollar development that is positioned to create more than 300 permanent jobs in Watts.  She developed and coached the nonprofit that reforested over 30,000 acres with 1.5 million native trees along the gulf coast with more than 3,500 volunteers; developed the first and only housing database for Hurricane Katrina; following the Los Angeles Civil Unrest (Rodney King riots), she aided in securing $1.6 million for community redevelopment efforts; for nearly three years, volunteered at the Chino prison, coaching men preparing for release (decreased the recidivism rate by 70%).





Sherita continuously serves as the goto consultant for numerous celebrity and athlete social entrepreneurs, including:  Oscar winning actress Hilary Swank; NFL great Jim Brown; legendary actress Tippi Hedren; Hall of Famer Bootsy Collins; Film Producer/actor Bill Duke; Comedians Kim Coles, Michael Colyar, Anthony Anderson, Eddie Griffin and so many others.  She has been featured in Women of Wisdom magazine with First Lady Michelle Obama; received the California Women of Achievement award with Congresswomen Maxine Waters and Diane Watson; and was awarded the African Focus Humanitarian Award with R&B songstress Chaka Khan and comedian/actress Monique Hicks, while being featured in â€œWomen of Colorâ€ magazine with the late Coretta ScottKing, Maya Angelou and numerous other renaissance women, just to name a few.





From creating programs for battered women and forming after school programs for youth in the U.S. to installing water towers in the Philippines, K.I. has touched lives all over the globeâ€”China, Mexico, Australia, Russia, Canada, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, India, South America, Belgium, Trinidad, Tobago, and so many others.


","Because of our ongoing community efforts, K.I. has many collaborative partners excited about C360:  CEO Space business forums (trained millions of business owners over 20 years); Rev. Norman D. Copeland (Presiding Elder of AME churches in South LA); Community Powers in Action (working with youth and families); LATalk Radio providing radio air time featuring those making a difference ; the newly launched South LA Chamber and Community alliance with CoFounder Stephan McGlover; Computer Global Works offering computer training to individuals and entrepreneurs, and so many others, including many celebrities: Anthony Anderson, Les Brown, Kim Coles, Michael Colyar, Bootsy Collins and more.","A significant part of developing success programs is implementing an effective evaluation plan.  You canâ€™t know where you going, if you canâ€™t tell where you are, or where youâ€™ve been.  





C360 will accomplish this implementing an intake form to gather information on each participant/entrepreneur, i.e., socioeconomic position, education, marital status, etc.; designed to fit the program component.  





Below are two extremely different examples of how we will help build the capacity of our participants by helping them develop effective evaluation tools to measure their successes.





Example #1





For business development training and entrepreneurship, our initial intake form might encompass the following questions:





1)	How long have you been in business, if applicable?


2)	How many employees do you have?     03	410	1020	  50+	


3)	What is your annual operating budget?  Under $25,000	    $25k  $100k     $100k  $500k      $500k plus


4)	How many collaborations have you made with other businesses or organizations to build your capacity, while helping community?	0	15	5+


5)	How active are you in your surrounding communities?  (1extremely low, 5extremely):  	1  2  3  4  5  





After being involved with C360 for three months, we would ask similar questions to see if their employee count has increase/decreased; if the operating budget improved; if they increased their involvement community and formed capacity building collaborations that increased their customers, and/or bottom line, etc. 





This could change the current situation where 36% of the population lives below the poverty level.





Example #2





If a childcare collaborates with a yoga instructor to reduce the stress levels of toddlers, the intake form could ask the following (completed by the parent/guardian and the teacher)  rating as follows: 1 being extremely low to 5 being exceptional:





1)	How old is the child?


2)	What has been the behavioral patterns of the child?


             a.	Has trouble communicating effective 			1  2  3  4  5  


             b.	Has frequent bed wetting					1  2  3  4  5  


             c.	Tends to withdraw when in new environments		1  2  3  4  5  


3)	How involved is the parent in the childâ€™s daycare experience? 	1  2  3  4  5  


4)	Is the child from a   ___ twoparent, ___ singleparent or ___foster care home environment?





These are just some of the questions that could be asked to monitor improved communication; enhanced selfesteem; reduced stress levels and more after being  involved in yoga; which is statistically proven to help toddlers find inner peace.  The funding for this kind of program will also help the operating budget for both small business owners (child care director and yoga instructor).  This would reduce the statistics that toddler enter kindergarten with the stress of 9th graders.





The compiled information would be incorporated into our designed data tracking system to reveal the areas of growth for small business development and participant empowerment.


","In addition to using our strategies for cross collaborations of services, business industries and community, C360 will create a unique business incubator; one focused on helping lowincome individuals that are struggling to start or maintain a business, without continued support.  So often, these povertystricken entrepreneurs are trying to work from home without adequate support, training, and business camaraderie that aids with creativity, improved strategies and more.  As recent as this month (March 2013), Best Buy and Yahoo have called back into the office their virtual employees for these same reasons.





Itâ€™s apparent that our proposed service area is a compilation of high and lowincome individuals (South LA), which presents huge gaps that must be considered, i.e., from unemployed/underemployed, crime, gangs, and cultural differences between black and brown communities; to the other side of the coin; comprised of the more affluent areas around USC, Staples Center, LA Live, etc. â€“ where we must work on retaining large and small businesses, that will not sustain without continual growth in the surrounding areas.





As stated before, though much growth is evident in some areas, the composition of the surrounding neighborhoods are complicated with many nuances:





â€¢	Approximately 36% of the population lives below the poverty level (state average 14%)


â€¢	There are more than 7,000 singleparent households  5,000+ being lead by women


â€¢	Nearly 60% of the population has less than a high school education


â€¢	Much of the area is plagued with excessive crime; severe cultural differences; high instances of homelessness, and more





K.I.â€™s vast experience in social advocacy, community development, and small business creation, positions us to develop workable solutions to create jobs for the hardtoemploy; implement programs to aid and empower disenfranchised populations; improve public safety, and execute effective strategies that will cross industries, cultures, and biases for economic sustainability.  





One of our prime strategies is small business creation through forprofit and nonprofit collaborations, which aids in small business creation.    In order for small businesses to serve their historic roles as the catalyst for job creation, they must have a support system, to remain competitive in todayâ€™s global marketplace.  Our target populations must have the confidence and ability to invest in this economy to create jobs â€“ thus is the need for C360â€™s business and community supportive services.  





Though thousands of organizations offer various aspects of job, career or business training, few facilities offer capacity building, or business incubation for our target populations of individuals with great minds and ability, but lack the advanced training and socioeconomic means to advance their dreams and skills.





C360's strategies are designed to create ongoing positive change, which can serve as a pilot for other underserved populations.


","Similar to the growth that downtown Los Angeles has experienced:  Recent research reveals that over the past 10 years, downtown LA has experienced an extraordinary commercial and residential renaissance.  With some 45,000 residents (up 15.1% from 2008), 500,000+ weekday employees and more  than 10 million annual nonlocal visitors, Downtown LA has become Southern Californiaâ€™s economic engine.  Despite the recent recession, residents, employees and visitors have continued to grow and mature since the 2008 study.  This growth includes the increasingly welleducated, higherincome, active and diverse population that is relocating to the downtown area.





With C360â€™s defined goals to enrich the surrounding communities, we will impact the now standing statistics where approximately 36% of the population lives below the poverty level (state average 14%); where more than 7,000 singleparent households  5,000+ being are being lead by women; where nearly 60% of the population has less than a high school education, and where much of the area is plagued with excessive crime; severe cultural differences; high instances of homelessness.





C360 will create a nationwide movement that recognizes the connection between a healthy economy and strong, vibrant communities.  Part of C360â€™s outreach initiative is to provide training to local residents, community organizations and businesses, on how to invest in themselves and their community through our consumer consciousness training.  Though residents in the lower socioeconomic sector know little about community economic strengthening, they play a very significant role.  





By empowering the lower socioeconomic populations that often represent higher rates of substance abuse, domestic violence, high unemployment, low test scores and high dropout rates, soaring crime, and so many other damaging practices that aid in community deprivation; C360 will be paving the way ensured social connectedness.  





Social status, as described by income, largely determines so much of a personâ€™s life, i.e., education, health, voting and other aspects of their life.  Recent studies in the field of public opinion stress the high correlation between the voterâ€™s socioeconomic status and his voting tendency.





Based on the latest information from the LA March 2013 election, where  roughly $19 million was spent in the 2013 mayoral primary, but just 21 percent of registered voters turned out to vote (the lowest rate for a primary without an incumbent since 1978 â€“ itâ€™s evident that we must build the trust, effectiveness and wealth of South Los Angeles.

3102140,2013140,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/lasmartmap.html,Connecting Angelenos Through Smart Engaging Neighborhood Maps, Social Connectedness,"<p>We are living in a golden age of cartography. Google, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), locationbased services, and the explosion of socalled big data have combined to create a wellspring of information that â€” if utilized with ethics, intelligence, and vision â€” can provide customized, actionable intelligence for local communities in real time. If Los Angeles really is just a â€œpatchwork of disparate communities,â€ then the goal should be to bind these communities as one. For thousands of years, maps have served as a unifying tool and as a cornerstone of a knowledgebased society born from the Enlightenment.</p> 





<p>Our idea is to create the most informationrich, dynamic, and engaging digital map of Los Angelesâ€™ neighborhoods that has ever existed. This map would be platform agnostic, primarily Webbased but also customized for mobile phones and ereaders, and built in an opensource coding language such as Django, a highlevel Python Web framework.</p> 





<p>We would start by promoting a request for proposal that calls for local artists to submit designs of a large, comprehensive map of Los Angeles. An online, crowdsourced competition would select the winning design. Hyperlinks embedded within the actual map would connect users to dozens of specific community pages representing and supporting the unique features of individual neighborhoods and communities.</p> 





<p>The depth, texture, and relevance of the information provided on each community page is limitless, but the goal is simple: Provide local citizens with an invaluable resource to learn more about their immediate communities while engaging one another, the city at large, and their elected officials.</p>





<p>Imagine a single destination where you could find out how much green space is available to your kids, what the teachertostudent ratio is at your local high school, what building permits have been issued for construction, where you could find opportunities to volunteer, what the agenda is for the upcoming school board meeting, or whether the crime rate in your neighborhood is rising or falling, Then imagine a way to complement that information in a dynamic forum where you could exchange ideas, comments, goods, even your best recipes.</p> 





<p>Companies like Google, Esri, and Fwix have created a powerful technological foundation for these smart maps, but a vital, localized service requires customization, collaboration with local entities (both public and private), and a deeply nuanced understanding of the neighborhoods and communities targeted. That is the complementary value that L.A. Currents can provide to this project.</p>","<p>L.A. Currents is a digital news publication about life in Los Angeles. Our aim is to to chart the changing face of Los Angeles by melding technology and storytelling. We report on important local people, institutions, and trends. Since our beta launch in November, we have seen our traffic double every month.</p> 





<p>We recently announced a contentandcommunity partnership with USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and together we are coordinating our local L.A. coverage. This type of collaboration â€” in which a journalism program serves as an anchor institution for a local, upstart media company â€” is an innovative way for graduate students to get realworld experience and handson training while allowing a media company to get its sea legs in a rather unstable media marketplace.</p>  





<p>Additionally, L.A. Currents is currently the only West Coast partner of The Guardianâ€™s n0tice technology, which allows us to engage our readers in new and innovative ways. We have cast a wide net to our areaâ€™s creative community, and our stable of professional writers includes traditional reporters, bloggers, screenwriters, essayists, and fiction writers.</p> ","<p>L.A. City Council and the Information Technology and General Services Committee</p>


<p>USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</p>


<p>Google</p>


<p>Brian Addison, former CEO of EveryBlock (recently shuttered by NBC)</p>


<p>The Guardian Newspaper</p>


<p>Beth Noveck, author of Wiki Government: How Technology Can Make Government Better, Democracy Stronger and Citizens More Powerful</p>","<p>Success will be measured by interactivity and revenue. Analytical metrics embedded into the map will measure where, when, and how it is being utilized. We would also reserve editorial space for individual bloggers in each neighborhood to focus on news and commentary about hyper local issues to stimulate further discussion. In addition to online engagement activated by this map, we would provide instructions that users could employ to organize and produce live events in their neighborhoods, events such as discussions, block parties, and cleanups. Success in activating facetoface engagement among neighbors and across communities would be another measure.</p>





<p>Furthermore, by its very nature, this map would be an obvious platform on which local retailers could advertise. Another measure of success would be the creation of a revenuepositive product built around a webbased, auction marketplace for local retailers. The goal is a sustainable, if not profitable, product.</p> 


","<p>Coming on the heels of the extremely low voter turnout in the recent local election (20 percent), it is clear that Los Angeles is grappling with widespread apathy and low civic engagement. Part of the problem has to do with the lack of a sense of community and connectivity among residents.</p> 





<p>The geography of the city is partially to blame for this. The vastness of the region and the varying municipalities are such that a sense of a unified city does not resonate. A beautifully rendered map displaying how we are all connected, which is enriched with real time information and the tools necessary to engage local residents in each individual neighborhood, will bring about a new level of awareness, activity, and involvement.</p> 





<p>The project would serve as a case study for public/private collaboration in Los Angeles. This week the L.A. City Council is strategizing about how to create the cityâ€™s first opendata initiative, which would include the coordination and participation of multiple departments. Data from city agencies would be openly shared with the public and between city departments with an eye towards launching a pilot program in June 2013. The timing for a potential coordination between L.A. Currentsâ€™ smart map, served by a virtual treasure trove of pertinent, unreleased public data, is serendipitous.</p> 





<p>We live in the most informationrich period in human history, but many people in Los Angeles are not getting the right information in the right format to help increase their civic awareness. For centuries, maps have provided structure, guidance, and helped activate new ways of seeing the world. Today is no different.</p> 


","Success in 2050 would reveal Los Angeles residents who are ardently aware of local issues and comfortable in their connection to their city. There are many positive transformative forces at work that, if recognized and harnessed, could drastically improve social connectedness in Los Angeles by 2050. Transitoriented development, viable publictransportation alternatives, opendata initiatives by the local government, greater awareness of local politics and cultural offerings, honest discussions about the importance of public education and our relationship to the natural environment are all current topics that if cultivated could result in creating a higher, local consciousness. Technology is a tool to further us along this path. "
3102141,2013141,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/RovingRioVistasLA.html,Roving RÃ­o Vista: A Park on the Move, Social Connectedness,"<p>	The Los Angeles River is one of the last great untapped public spaces in the region.  What if we could make it easy to explore the L.A. River as an outdoor destination and greenway that inspires Angelenos to discover, connect, and create? With a Roving Rio Vista, we can! <p>	





<p>	What is a Roving Rio Vista?<p>	


<p>	Imagine a mobile 21st century park that can help to reclaim the edge and public easements of the L.A. River.  We want to  build an experiential and moveable space for people to discover, connect, and create. With our Roving Rio Vista we will test what people want in their public spaces along the LA River.  Could it be something as simple as a seesaw, or shade, or homemade lemonade? We do know that we want to encourage social interaction and fun on the L.A. River. <p>	





<p>	Where will it go?<p>	


	


<p>	If youâ€™ve ever been to the L.A. River you know that there are bicyclists, families walking their dogs, equestrians riding to Griffith Park and soon many more kayakers. But there is also so much idle public space (the river is 51 miles long) that is underused and waiting to be transformed. Often these spaces are right next to a key street used by 1000 of Angelenosâ€”like where Glendale, Los Feliz or Fletcher cross the river.  A popup park on these properties allows people to imagine what could be, while bringing it to life. Whether it is through a game of tetherball or a ride on a seesaw, a Roving Rio Vista allows us to experience the exciting possibilities of the river as a new outdoor destination in Los Angeles.<p>	





<p>	Why Roving?<p>	





<p>	While we build more greenways and transform the river, we want to experiment and test what works in defining a civic space for all Angelenos to enjoy.  What do people want in this unique outdoor place?  How do we design space that is versatile, affordable, durable, and demonstrates the innovation we seek in transforming the river?  This popup solution will bring people to the river and allow us to test how active civic space can transform communities. .  It will engage a dozen different neighborhoods in building common groundâ€”physically and socially. The park will travel until it can be installed permanently on a site.<p>	


","<p>The L.A. River is at the heart of our vision is to make Los Angeles a cleaner, greener, and more connected community. We transform the LA River in order to improve peopleâ€™s lives by carrying out sustainable land use projects, advocating for riverfriendly public policy, and programs for community benefit.<p>





<p>We work to improve the quality of life for Angelenos in four key areas:<p> 


<p>	â€¢ Create social and economic value along the LA River<p>	


<p>	â€¢ Connect neighborhoods to the LA River and accelerate the corridorâ€™s role as an alternative transport route <p>	


<p>	â€¢ Bring people to the LA River for recreation, community space, and public gatherings<p>	


<p>	â€¢ Enhance the river channel and advance habitat restoration by incorporating green infrastructure improvements.<p>	





<p>Some recent achievements include:<p>


<p>	â€¢ Led the development of the first major philanthropic investment on the LA River with an iconic cablestay pedestrianequestrianbicycle bridge in North Atwater,  creating a new destination on the LA River (to break ground this summer)<p>	


	


<p>	â€¢ Secured a $13.3 million commitment to the community from NBC Universal to create LA River bike path connecting a key stretch from Griffith Park to Studio City by spearheading a coalition of environmental and cycling nonprofits<p>	





<p>	â€¢ Championed a broadbased coalition of public, philanthropic, private and nonprofit partners to promote LA River Greenway 2020 campaign â€“ a continuous recreational greenway for public benefit along all 51 miles of the LA River <p>	





<p>	â€¢ Facilitated the funding to open the Elysian Valley Community Garden<p>	


	


<p>	â€¢ Raised $10,000 on Kickstarter to host the firstever L.A. River Bikein Movie Theater in April<p>	","<p>We will partner with Green LAâ€™s Living Streets Initiative and the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) to make the Roving RÃ­o Vistas a reality.<p>





<p>The Living Streets Initiative designs and builds demonstration projects to make LA a more livable, sustainable city. Living Streets projects are affordable, immediate improvements designed and built by the communities they serve.

3102142,2013142,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LACYBCommunitySafety.html,Young people want to feel safe too, Public Safety,"""Fear is very real in the lives of children from hard places. In fact, fear often â€˜bulliesâ€™ our children into much of their misbehavior. As a result, it is critical that parents of children from hard places approach fear and feardriven behaviors with compassion, insight and wisdom.""   Dr. Karyn Purvis   http://empoweredtoconnect.org/theimpactoffear/


Youth do not feel safe anymore in the streets or anywhere outside of their community.  Often times they do not feel safe in their community.  One of the key issues is the distrust between youth and law enforcement.  The contacts between the two entities are often negative or for enforcement purposes only leaving our youth feeling disfranchised not just by gangs, bullies, or antagonists, but by the very system designed to protect them.  


Oftentimes, this negative interaction stays with youth and they lose faith in law enforcement.  Whether the reasoning is correct or not, a greater trust must be forged by youth and public safety and that includes increased education for both entities.  Youth must be empowered, educated, and entertained as they seek to learn about law enforcement and the role it can and should play in their lives.  Furthermore, a bridge must be established with law enforcement where they embrace the youth of Los Angeles as a resource.  


Our program will seek to educate the youth through education and the use of interactive software designed empower youth on their rights, as well promote discourse with law enforcement agencies.  This program will encourage youth to become involved in youth advisory councils that are in place in their communities and help in the design of a community youth program that LA CAUSA is designing to encourage peer leadership to reduce crime, increase accountability, increase communication between the public and law enforcement entities including parents, peers, community, police, sheriffs, city and district attorneys, and the courts.  


The program will teach youth the law and increase their understanding of its role in their lives, how to react to law enforcement contacts, the criminal justice system process so that the youth understands how it can help them, and finally to become vocal members of the community to increase community participation in a restorative justice program that LA CAUSA YouthBuild is creating.  It has been proven through many different studies that a restorative justice model will work in any community it is instituted.  http://www.whyme.org/victims/victimsandrestorativejusticestatistics/


This program sets the foundation of young leaders as being active not passive participants in this program and allows them to work with leadership at all levels of promotion and become the stakeholders themselves in this process.  The outcomes should lead to lower recidivism rates for all violators who participate in a rj program, but in this cycle show lower negative contacts with law enforcement for all serviced youth and increased participation in the development of a rj program.  This would have the youth as stakeholders go to these entities and serve as cosponsors of program development and implementation.


The outcome is reduced crime, increased trust between our youth and law enforcement, and increased youth participation in crime reduction strategies.


","LA CAUSA YouthBuild is regarded as the organization that transformed the perception that the lives of the  youth it serves from a deficit based perspective (identifying the things they lack such as income, healthy food, education, employment) to an asset based population (passionate, conceptual thinkers, willing, and determined) that can overcome the challenges of life.  It's asset based thinking model has been adopted nationally by YouthBuild USA and many other programs. 


LA CAUSA has empowered young leaders since 2005, allowing them the opportunity to go to post secondary education, start their own nonprofits, and become gainfully employed in a variety of jobs whereas, as new students in LA CAUSA they were young adults with no high school diplomas and limited job skills.  We have served thousands of youth over a very limited time.


The organization was recognized by former Secretary of Labor of the Western United States opening of the United We Serve initiative of volunteerism by President Obama in 2010.  LA CAUSA has long focused on empowering our youth to volunteer as an AmeriCorps designated site and countless projects to ""green"" East LA and build gardens and healthy eating and living opportunities.  With that our organization continues to be progressive and promote challenging learning models including a mental toughness curriculum designed to prepare our youth for the world outside of our walls.


Recognized as one of unincorporated East Los Angeles's only youth services group.  The opportunities and resources in the community are relatively limited while showing significant positive outcomes.


","This program will initially seek to involve the youth of LA CAUSA, Strategies for Youth (strategiesforyouth.org), the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, LA Probation, and courts to run these classes.  We will then outreach to other YouthBuild programs, and local entities with youth programs.  It will be an all inclusive program.  They will participate in trainings, and meetings, eventually becoming stakeholders in the development of the restorative justice program that LA CAUSA is working on.","Success on this project will be measured on a pre and post survey basis.  It will deal with officer knowledge base and youth knowledge base.  Furthermore, a followup will be attempted with our youth alumni who receive this service to see the impact of the trainings will have on their meetings.  The restorative justice program will be a much longer term program which will be an evidence based project with a longer timeline. The initial conception and stakeholder development will occur in this program.  The goal of this program will be to measure the fear level and distrust which will also be done via surveys ,ensuring activeness and openness to dealing with law enforcement and different location in Los Angeles.","Los Angeles is a big city. It is a safe city.  But, our city doesn't feel safe to any of our youth and many adults.  This misperception could arguably create more unhappiness than we really need.  The fear of regions that have been infamously labeled such as ""South Central"", and ""East LA"" characterize the perception of fear people have for areas they have never really visited or experienced. Furthermore, controversies such as the Rodney King Beating and human rights violation charges in the Sheriff's department only further the perception that Los Angeles is a dangerous uninhabitable city. When in reality much has changed while the perception of these agencies has not.  The research project by SORIN MATEI, SANDRA J. BALLROKEACH, and JACK LINCHUAN QIU, titled, ""Fear and Misperception of Los Angeles Urban Space: A SpatialStatistical Study of CommunicationShaped Mental Maps."" http://mentalmap.org/files/matei_fear_CR.pdf


Statistically analyzed how heightened and unsafe our populace feels even though crime has dropped to 1950 levels.  Part of the fear is of law enforcement by youth.  They do not see law enforcement as a support system, rather they see them as ""the system"" which is designed to take them from their families, harm them, and carry weapons.  The dialogue has disappeared and youth no longer actively participate in the community policing relationship.  


This project will teach youth the law so they understand the logic and perception that law enforcement must walk within while investigating crimes.  Furthermore, they will be actively exposed to law enforcement so the fear of the unknown will be reduced.  RJ means less administrative and criminal justice costs.  Officers will be able to patrol more rather than be involved in administrative protocols involving youth, the courts will have reduced responsibility, public trust will increase and community policing with be promoted.  Furthermore, it reduces incarceration of youth which saves $200,000 per youth in the system.  This program will save literally millions with just the initial investment of $100,000 to help our community.


Using Strategies For Youth's Model of juvenile justice Jeopardy and Policing the Teen brain LA CAUSA is poised to empower youth and law enforcement.  Eventually engaging them in dialogue on a level that is frank, intimate, and respectful.  Youth and law enforcement alike will learn to empathize and communicate, role play and discourse together.  Society as a whole in Los Angeles will benefit.


","Crime will always exist in a city in which their are inequity and human beings.  What can be changed is the level of trust between the public and law enforcement.  Use of law enforcement as a resource for safety and open communication indicate a happier more trusting public.  LA CAUSA seeks to have it's young leaders become stewards of change in a community that has been voiceless.  In a community with many immigrants, fear of the system has led to victimization and our young people can be the generation that starts the cycle of change from protesting to advocating for improved relationships.  Youth will not be so easily incarcerated.  Intervention and prevention models will be used and effective in the lives of youth reducing recidivism.  Officers will have more of the community identified as advocates and voices of their patrol that they can rely on for support and dialogue.  It is not always to agree, but rather to dialogue in a trusting manner so that consensus and understanding can be maintained.  Only in this way will the community truly be the eyes and ears of law enforcement to reduce crime, promote safety, and reduce fear."
3102143,2013143,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/saladbowl.html,Youth Take Their Lives Off The Streets And Into Gardens, Environmental Quality,"     Todayâ€™s youth will bring tomorrowâ€™s environmental change.  Los Angeles Communities Advocating for Unity, Social Justice and Action, Inc (LA CAUSA) believes that our youth possess the power to bring systemic change to their environments.  Our youth go from the Streets2Gardens.  The Streets2Gardens program will be a stepping stone to establishing a communityâ€™s ability to become selfsustainable by growing its own food, as well as addressing the issue of the quality of air, through the engagement of disenfranchised youth at elementary schools.  


     The goals of the Streets2Gardens program are twofold:  (1) create a curriculum that is engaging to youth and small children in order to encourage participation in growing gardens and trees to improve the environment of impoverished areas; and (2) get different communities in LA County to support green initiatives to improve their environment though planting gardens and trees.  


     When there is a curriculum that is engaging and relevant to the community, the possibilities are endless.  LA CAUSA's youth will create an engaging curriculum for elementary school children in schools the most affected by environmental neglect. LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will also conduct research and determine which elementary schools they wish to approach.  The goal is to select two elementary schools in cities, such as Huntington Park, Highland Park, Rosemead and even as far as Pomona.  These schools will be in addition to two elementary schools which LA CAUSA has already been working with in Los Angeles:  Humphreys Avenue Elementary and Eastman Avenue Elementary School.


     Once they have selected the schools, then the real fun begins.  Alongside the elementary school children, our youth will plant gardens with an array of native Southern California plants, including fruits, vegetables and trees.  As part of the program, our youth, with the assistance of experienced staff, will also educate the elementary school children and the surrounding community about the environmental benefits of growing their own food and planting trees.  They will treat the soil, plant the seeds and trees, harvest the crop, and educate the elementary school children on how they can do the same at home and help the environment, as well as have healthier food options.  The youth will also give workshops to the community about the importance of youth getting involved in environmental issues and share their work at the elementary school gardens.


     There is power in numbers.  There would be about 10 youth involved in this program, broken up into two teams of five and assigned to one of the existing gardens and one of the new gardens.  In addition, our youth will host a minimum of two community workshops, bringing different sections of the County together.  


LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will use their creativity to produce marketing materials, such as brochures and a video of their work, to promote the program and the positive impact of youth involved in environmental issues.  The written materials will inform the community of the work being done, why it is being done and who is performing the work, with special thanks to the funder that made it all possible.  The video will track the curriculum created and show how any school and family can take their limited resources to grow a garden that can produce healthy food options, as well as address environmental concerns about air quality.    


      Through the Streets2Gardens program, LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will learn necessary life skills that will be transferrable to postsecondary education and employment opportunities.  They will be taught to be accountable to their peers and the community by being timely, perform, and work as a team.  Therefore, they will receive compensation in the form of stipends to model after a reallife employment situation.  If they do not meet the requirements of the program, then their pay will suffer.  These necessary life skills will give our youth the ability to establish positive habits that will enhance their level of success in postsecondary education and employment.  In educating the elementary school children and the community about the program, our youth will incorporate how life responsibilities affect the outcome of your efforts.  For instance, if the garden keepers lack responsibility and fail to timely care for plants and trees, the environment suffers.       


     LA CAUSA believes that through these gardens, some of the most impoverished areas of Los Angeles can become selfsustainable and be better equipped to control their environment.  Through the involvement of the program's youth, LA CAUSA seeks to show that when you give youth a sense of purpose, they can be catalysts for change no matter where they come from or what their past looks like.  The youth will give back to the community and engage in environmental activism to improve the same area that is currently being destroyed by poverty and environmental neglect.


","     LA CAUSA has successfully begun to grow gardens at Humphreys Elementary and Eastman Elementary.  These gardens have served to host mentor/mentee events and has engaged a number of community youth and elementary school children.  Through the California Endowment, LA CAUSA has also helped corner stores in Boyle Heights change their appearance and products to offer healthier foods, including more fruits and vegetables.  The corner stores receiving this attention are those surrounding poorperforming elementary schools in Boyle Heights.  Recently, San Gabriel Conservation Core and LA CAUSA have been discussing a partnership to grow a community farm that would feed families in need of healthier food options.","     LA CAUSA has been fortunate to have a great ally in San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corp., which has express a interest in creating a partnership to address environmental issues, in particular, the need for the community to become selfsustainable through the cultivation of gardens and farms.  In addition, Humphreys Elementary, Eastman Elementary are current partners in LA CAUSA's efforts and we look forward to contacting two additional elementary schools to expand the work LA CAUSA has begun.  LA CAUSA will also actively continue looking for opportunities to create partnerships and collaboration with other organizations to further LA CAUSA's garden ideas.  ","     As part of the curriculum, pre and post assessments can be given to the elementary school children, as well as the community members who attend the workshops.  These assessments will reflect how much they knew about the benefits of gardens on the environment before working with LA CAUSA and compare it to the knowledge base after attending an educational session or workshop with LA CAUSA.  It will also measure the likelihood of those engaged in the program to remain involved in the future.  We will create a database to track the age of the participants, knowledge before the program and after, and their likelihood to remain involved in some way with improving their environment.  The goal is to have at least 80% of the participants give the program a successful rating.  ","     Streets2Gardens program will benefit Los Angeles by bridging the gap between different communities on the issue of environmental neglect.  The Streets2Gardens program will create and promote a garden curriculum that can be replicated in any school and individual home.  The program will also show how youth have a tremendous amount of power in changing the circumstances of their communities.  By putting soil, seeds and trees in the hands of our youth, and connecting them with their community in a positive way, they will become catalysts for systemic change in their environments.  Streets2Gardens will begin by getting 10 youth off the streets and into gardens, creating and teaching a garden curriculum that will be engaging and powerful.  Streets2Gardens will get result in different sections of Los Angeles County coming together to discuss how their environment affects them and how the gardens will begin to address a number of health and environmental issues.  


     The two existing gardens and the two new gardens, plus trees to be planted at all four sites, will begin a trend that will result in improved health and air quality in the area.  The gardens will harvest fruits and vegetables that can be eaten by the children at the school and/or their parents.  With the curriculum that is going to be created and shared with the participating schools, the schools can encourage and teach the parents to plant their own fruit and vegetable gardens.  The possibilities are endless.  


","     LA CAUSA envisions Los Angeles to be full of gardens at all schools and homes.  The schools and homes would provide healthy food options to the community, thus realizing true selfsustainability.  It follows that the air quality would have improved given the increased presence of plants and trees in the communities.  Los Angeles would look green with rich reds, oranges, and yellows, to name a few colors, with crisp wind blowing.   





The youth who made this possible are likely to be involved in address environmental issues as public servants, lawyers practicing environmental law, leaders in notforprofits with environmental focus, and the like.  This is especially true for LA CAUSA youth who tend to engage in work that improve their communities.  These youth would have led generations of young people into the realm environmental consciousness, resulting in stronger communities advocating for better environmental conditions.  They would also be mentoring young people who continue with the mission to ensure Los Angeles is green and clean.   





The curriculum that Streets2Gardens youth created would have been improved and shared with all of the elementary schools in the United States.

The nonprofit LA Cleantech Incubator has launched 14 new companies in just the last 18 months, creating over 75 direct jobs & millions of dollars in job opportunities for electricians, maintenance technicians, engineers, fabricators, plumbers, construction workers, office workers, executives, manufacturing workers, & more.  When the La Kretz Innovation Campus opens less than a year from today, we will have capacity to serve substantially more companies at various stages of growth, as well as a more robust workforce development capability â€“ & this is just the beginning.</p>


<p> Create a Roadmap for Revitalizing the Downtown Industrial District: Our goal is to transform what was once LAâ€™s industrial core into a vibrant, growing Cleantech Corridor, thus creating a longlasting economy & sustainable, familysupporting jobs for Angelinos.  This project enlists a strong group of partners in economic development, policy, planning, architecture, higher education, local political & community leadership, as well as business leaders & entrepreneurs. Together, we will build on our assets to create, demonstrate, & promote a new Cleantech Corridor Roadmap that will serve as an actionplan for building this regional hub.</p>


<p> Seize the Cleantech Opportunity: Cleantech innovation is critically important to the United States, & to Los Angeles in particular.  The sector is massive and growing at a tremendous rate. The global market volume of the cleantech sector today is $2.7 Trillion per year, and it is projected to double by 2025. Mirroring global trends, renewable energy is the fastest growing sector in the US economy, growing 49% between 2007 and 2011. </p>


<p>Along with this enormous new market opportunity come opportunities for creating wellpaying, sustainable and diverse jobs. Nationwide, cleantech jobs pay 13% more than jobs outside the sector, and 26% of all cleantech jobs lie in manufacturing as compared to only 9% of jobs in the economy as a whole. These jobs are higher paying and growing at 10 times the rate of nongreen jobs. Los Angeles is already the second largest green economy in the US, but important as cleantech is to LAâ€™s economy today, it will be orders of magnitude more important in the decades to come as the world rebuilds its transportation & energy infrastructure.</p>


<p>Alongside these promising statistics, it is important to note another widely acknowledged fact: creating new companies is the best way to create new jobs.  For example, during the last three decades all net new jobs created in the United States â€“ 44million â€“ have come from companies less than five years old. The Kaufman Foundation did an important study about economic growth & found that new companies create an average of three million new jobs every year in the US while existing companies lose one million jobs.  This is why we focus on new company creation.</p>


<p> Build a Cleantech Corridor: The next step is the creation of a hub for this burgeoning industry in Los Angeles. Encompassing a 4mile stretch of land straddling  the LA river from Union Station to Washington Blvd., from the Arts District to Boyle Heights, the Cleantech Corridor is that hub. We think of it as an Arts and Innovation District on the banks of the LA River.</p>


<p> Our Action Plan: Over the sevenmonth period of this grant, LACI/CTLA will work with our partners and collaborators to produce an interactive roadmap that will demonstrate how current constraints, including existing policies, infrastructure, programs, etc. can be adapted to transform a blighted neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles into a thriving new industrial powerhouse that will serve as a hub for the regionâ€™s clean economy.</p>


<p>Semesterlong, multidisciplinary studios will be conducted at USCâ€™s public policy and architecture schools, as well as SCIArc. We will examine issues and opportunities and how these manifest in terms of buildings, infrastructure, and the way we interact. Most importantly, we will explore how this profound growth of new companies will change the picture in terms of number of jobs, job density, and wages accross the economic spectrum. </p>


<p>The result will be a critical examination of the current policy environment, leading to an action plan for the City, and an interactive visual representation of how these exciting projects will be integrated into the community.  All findings will be published, and presented for review and comment.</p>


<p>We will do all of this while expanding the LA Cleantech Incubator and Clean Tech Los Angeles, building the La Kretz Innovation Campus, supporting development of the Cleantech Manufacturing Center, and creating real, family supporting jobs every day.</p>","<p>CTLA:  Created by the Mayor in 2009, CTLA is partnership of the regionâ€™s most important institutions dedicated to making Los Angles a huge green economy.  Today, LA is the second largest green economy in the US, is the largest market for EVs and solar in the country, has more cleantech startups than any other region in the country, and is leading the way in renewable energy generation.</p>





<p>LACI:  In just 18 short months, LACI has created a vibrant cleantech innovation ecosystem that has spawned 14 new cleantech companies, attracted partnerships with industry/academia, and finalized the funding and planning for the $40M La Kretz Innovation Campus in the Cleantech Corridor.</p>","City of Los Angeles: Mayorâ€™s Office and Several City Council Offices, LADWP, MWD, USC, SCIArc, UCLA, Caltech, CSUN, 350 Green, 360 Power Group, 4sphere, California Lithium Battery, Hive Lighting, Chai Energy, Gridtest Systems, Magnovate Technologies, B.I.O.Tecture, Open Neighborhoods, Skyline Innovations, Somatis Technologies, EWaste Systems Inc., DB New Energy, Greneker, Trammel Crow, GT Law, Gibson Dunn, The Broad Foundations, Central City East Association, California Center for Sustainable Energy, Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, Los Angeles Business Council, Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, Wells Fargo Foundation","<p>The most important metrics all relate to jobs. We will need to ask the following questions: How many direct jobs have been created? How many indirect jobs? How sustainable are these jobs? Are they paying familysupporting wages? Are these truly â€œnewâ€ jobs, or are jobs being moved from one place to another?</p>





<p>There are also enabling indicators. How many companies have been created? How much capital has been infused into these companies? How diverse and broad is our team of collaborators? Have we effectively engaged all of the stakeholders in the process? Are current projects coming online on time? Are other recommendations being implemented? Is our report and interactive app being utilized? Etc.</p>","We will build new companies, that create new jobs, thereby revitalizing downtown Los Angelesâ€™ industrial core.





Broadly, we will bring back the industrial core of downtown Los Angeles by rebuilding it into the cleantech innovation and commercialization center of the region.  As a result, this area will once again provide familysupporting jobs for Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, East Los Angeles, Central and South Los Angeles, and beyond.





In the next 4 years alone just one of the envisioned projects of the Roadmap â€“ the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubatorâ€™s La Kretz Innovation Campusâ€”will generate over 1700 jobs from companies who pay $45M per year in salaries and wages and generate more than $85M per year in sales.





We will create a new industrial powerhouse dedicated to clean technologies and sustainable jobs.  We fully expect that by 2050, the LA Arts and Innovation District on the banks of the Los Angeles River will be the leading cleantech innovation and commercialization hub in the world.


","In 2050, Los Angeles will be as iconic for clean technology as Silicon Valley is for hitech. We will be worldrenown as a model for harnessing regional strengths to drive innovation, employment, sustainability, and livability in our diverse neighborhoods. We will be home to worldâ€™s largest cluster of cleantech companies, and with that, the largest population of workers in green jobs. The people who work these jobs will be well paid, highly respected, and proud to be building solutions to the worlds most pressing environmental, energy, water, and sustainability related challenges.

Organized and implemented through the work of volunteers from many of the areas to be explored, the project provides rich and varied options for people to interact across the divides that make it difficult for Angelenos to develop trust.  In addition to discovering attractions in each of the 40 neighborhoods on offer, an essential component of each experience is sharing a locally prepared meal.  Food is the great connector, providing a visceral way to get to know previously unknown neighbors based on the sharing of comfort through a wellprepared meal.   Eating together is an invitation to socialize and build relationships as barriers to interaction lower with each delicious bite eaten.  Seated in a restaurant, a backyard, a community garden or a church banquet hall, people from very different parts of Los Angeles come together and recognize their connection with others and feel more a part of the city.


Harvard scholar, Robert Putnam, writes on the value of â€œsocial capital,â€ or the benefits that derive from the cooperation between individuals and groups including a lessening of social isolation.  From â€œBetter Together,â€ â€œThe arts can nurture social capital by strengthening friendships, helping communities to understand and celebrate their heritage, and providing a safe way to discuss and solve difficult social problems. The arts provide a powerful way to transcend the cultural and demographic boundaries that divide us and to find deeper spiritual connections with those like us.â€ 


Found LA 2013 will be the third year of the festival. In 2011, 15 tours were held in neighborhoods across Los Angeles, from West Hollywood to San Pedro, from Santa Monica to Highland Park. Tour guides ranged from LA City Councilmember Eric Garcetti (Atwater Village) to food blogger Namju Cho (Koreatown) to youth organizers from Chucoâ€™s Justice Center (Inglewood/South LA). In Leimert Park, artist Karen Collins shared her African American Museum of Miniatures. The surprising Museum is comprised of shadow boxes created with found objects depicting scenes from the history of the African American communityâ€”from the royalty of Egypt to Martin Luther King and Mohammed Ali. The following year, 2012, the festival included 14 tours, and participation increased by 23%. Our goal for 2013 is to host 50 tours.


","Since programming activities began in 2003, LA Commons has developed grassroots projects and initiatives in 10 lowincome neighborhoods: MacArthur Park, Koreatown, Expo Park, Chinatown, MidCity, Sylmar, East Hollywood, Palms, Leimert Park and Highland Park. These programs have brought together 70 artists and 400 youth, along with 3825 community members in an innovative process of grass roots artistic and cultural discovery. 


Now in our tenth year, we have grown from a small to a midsize arts organization with one full time executive director and four parttime staff.  Over the past several years, LA Commons has developed a robust neighborhood tour program, Trekking LA, to leverage the rich content generated in our community arts projects; received contracts with the MTA and Community Redevelopment Agency (CRALA) and funding from The California Endowment, James Irvine Foundation, and Annenberg Foundation; and created partnerships with UCLA Department of Urban Planning, City Council offices, GOOD Magazine, Sony, and dozens of communitybased nonprofits.  In recognition of the important role played by the organization, Executive Director Karen Mack has been appointed to two city commissions and various boards.


"," Found LA will involve numerous partners â€“ from the tour guides and locations to media and organizational partners to sponsors. Collaborators this year will include KPCC, LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

	Quality of responses from tour guides and volunteers, e.g. level of interest from tour goers, authentic connections formed, level of satisfaction in planning and implementation process.


	Types of media coverage, e.g. feature stories highlighting specific people and neighborhoods, interviews with tour guides and tour goers.


","Found LA: Festival of Neighborhoods will benefit Los Angeles by offering Angelenos the opportunity to discover and rediscover their city through authentic connections with neighborhoods, their residents, and cultural treasures. At last yearâ€™s festival, Jamie Kim led a group on a tour of the Kwanumsa Buddhist Temple in Koreatown. She said, â€œIt was a fantastic opportunity for the temple to open its doors to a nonKorean speaking audience. It's when people come together that ideas become real and understanding deepens. That's very magical and I see that as one of the most important aspect of these neighborhood tours. So many people from the temple came up to me to tell me how happy and proud they were of the tour!â€


Angelenos can participate as volunteers and/or as tour goers. Volunteers will be recruited to lead, organize and support tours. A planning committee made up of individuals from across the city will work together to plan and promote the event beginning in May 2013. Funding from LA 2050 can support an enhanced marketing and public relations campaign to share the event and its benefits with a wide audience. The campaign would allow time for building interest in the festival through promotional materials (videos, print materials, etc.) highlighting the benefits of Angelenos engaging more deeply with their city. A strong focus will be on the food component of the Festival. Images and anecdotes of dishes, restaurants, and chefs (amateur and professional) will be used in the promotional materials. Volunteers from each participating neighborhood will be engaged to create buzz among their social networks â€“ online and offline. All of these levels of participation will support to the goal of social connectedness.


","Rates of volunteerism across all social strata have increased based on greater access to relevant opportunities to volunteers.  People report feeling more socially connected to each other and their city. More positive feedback on neighborhood offerings, hidden treasures, etc. Greater awareness of ethnic and social diversity of Los Angeles. People report greater interest in interacting and exploring parts of the city outside of their own neighborhoods. Greater sense of ownership and desire to contribute to the city."
3102146,2013146,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LALOMA.html,La Loma Center: Green Education Environmental Resources and Job Training , Income & Employment,"Our idea is to design, build, and operate a community center for the advancement of sustainable landscaping and permaculture jobs through green education, environmental resources, urban agriculture demonstrations and local food security programs.  We would use $100,000 wisely to complete our center, ramp up programming, and open our doors to the broader public.  We currently are located in a 30,000+ sq. ft. property in an Enterprise Zone, an underserved neighborhood (food desert), formerly a historic truck mechanic.  For nearly six months we have been using our cash flow from La Loma to convert this location into a base of â€œpostindustrial ecorenaissance.â€  We have also formed a nonprofit, named Zanja Madre, to handle the education, training, and pro bono work we do for the community, schools, and institutions.  For the La Loma Center, we have floated names like â€œSustainiaâ€ and â€œEcodepot,â€ but most importantly we have the place and people to do this now.  The facilities would be perfect for job training, professional certification courses, events and even conferences.  With creative reuse of the giant garages, mechanic bays, and grounds, we will be able to exhibit techniques and technologies, as well as provide the resources for the public to mimic the cutting edge demonstrations.  We also have an adjunct vacant lot in LA where we demonstrate natural techniques on the land.





Our idea clearly impacts nearly all of the indicators listed, however we will focus on income and employment after going through the rest of them.  Education will be improved by providing classes at various levels in collaboration with local schools and universities, as well as professional certification and job training programs.  We have active relationships with local high schools and community colleges, and the Art Center College of Design, Environmental Charter Schools, and LAUSD. 





Environmental quality will be impacted directly by the tools and resources we provide.  Our jobs increase watershed awareness, irrigation conservation, rainwater harvesting, and planting appropriate trees.  We design, build, and maintain organic gardens, as well as ecological restoration projects.  We will demonstrate how individuals can improve their immediate surroundings through the landscape.  





Health has been shown to improve through environmental quality,  practicing horticulture, and eating good local food.  Our facilities and programs will improve peopleâ€™s health by getting them to improve their lifestyles and connections to nature and community.  Also, we are in contact with the director of the public health department to create the first local organic food commissary, hosting qualifying food trucks, food carts, and mobile farmers' markets.  By providing access to local organic food we will eliminate food deserts and improve the health of the community.





Social connectedness is one of our primary goals at the community center, networking between organizations and individuals to synergize the local sustainability movement.  We already have become a hub for the permaculture world, making it feel like a small world with all of the relationships, and being invited to give talks at various conferences including Bioneers, Permaculture Convergence, Urban Ecology, and the Arboretum's Garden Show.





Arts and cultural vitality will radiate from our center with the look and feel style of the place, arts exhibitions focused on land art, green building, and creative expression.  We are a land based organization that believes our work is art and culture tied to the land.  We are not your average mow and blow or construction contractor, we are a designbuild firm with a social mission and a vision for the future.  





Moreover, La Loma provides jobs and income.  This year alone we have created thirty jobs with no budget allocated to job creation, simply by employing and training a diversity of local workers in real green projects.  We intend to dedicate our center to the creation of local wealth and sustainable livelihoods, by providing the tools and opportunities to do good for the local community and local environment.  We are fully confident that La Loma Center will become the leading place to acquire knowledge, credentials, and opportunities for increased incomes and job creation.  This is evident in our record of offering gainful employment, engaging workers' coops, and acting as an important stepping stone for dozens of careers.  ","Besides our latest project at our center....  La Loma is a critical partner in the creation of Arlington Gardens, a three acre, awardwinning community garden.  We were also awarded the Green Hero Award by Environmental Charter Schools for the greening of their campus, which also received national attention as a runnerup in the White House Race to the Top contest.  We received the Pasadena Beautiful Golden Arrow Award for our classic terraced vineyard project and other frontyard gardens.  We were published on the cover of Landscape Contractor Magazine for our use of recycled concrete in beautiful, monumental projects, as well as stories in LA Times, Sunset, Pasadena Star, and others.  We had an acclaimed installation, the Public Fruit Tree Theater, at LACMA that unfortunately was replaced by ""Levitated Mass.""  We have been publicly commended by several council members for our work at schools and other community projects, such as Plaza Morazan (Ed Reyes), Main St. Elementary (Jan Perry), Pasadena Senior Center (Steve Madison).  We bioremediated our site, eliminating the gasoline, oil and chemicals. We are leaders of converting toxic chlorine pools into Natural Pools, that create habitat and store drinking water.  We were called upon as an emergency responder to the recent windstorms, and we pride ourselves as being a force of nature for our community.  Currently we are finishing a large Demonstration Garden for the Chino Basin Water District.  Marco Barrantes was formerly a Parks and Recreation Commissioner, as well as a member of Food Policy Council, he wrote a book called ""Feed Your City: Urban Agriculture Food Systems.""  We are a registered Small Business, Minority Business Enterprise, and prequalified for projects with LAUSD, MWD, among other major institutions.

Marco Barrantes is the President of La Loma Development Company, with Masters of City Planning and Landscape Architecture.  He is also a certified Arborist, Permaculture Designer, and Green Roof Professional.  Marco founded La Loma as a General A and C27 in order to do the big projects he envisions without being hindered by bureaucratic restrictions.  As a designer and builder, with a standing team of skilled workers and professional staff, we are capable of doing amazing projects, as is demonstrated by our website. ","We will evaluate our projects by the number of jobs we create, the number of classes we hold, the number of job trainees we certify, the number of green projects we design, build and maintain, the amount of income we create for our workers and partners, the amount of income that goes back into the community through our nonprofit arm, the number of members that join our community center and food commissary.  The results will be easy to measure and straightforward.  We will create good jobs, local wealth, neighborhood projects that can not be missed.  Typically our gardens result in greater environmental awareness as is measured by testimonials and wordofmouth.  It is easy to measure our success by the gallons of water we capture or save, the number of trees we plant, the pounds of food we produce, the pounds of seeds we store and distribute, the tons of local waste we recycle into compost, mulch and building materials.  By counting the number of visitors that come through our locations, the number of awards and publications we have received and will continue to win.","Our project will benefit Los Angeles in numerous ways as was discussed above.  Specifically, we will have a major impact on the creation natural parks, beautiful gardens, and public spaces to organize community.  LA has a shortage of green spaces, we solve that problem.  We will empower the community with information and work, hosting regular classes, community workshops, and job training on a variety of relevant sustainability issues.  Specific subjects include Arboriculture, Aquaculture, Beekeeping, Soil, Water, Seeds, School Composting, Compost Tea, Vermiculture, Xeriscape, Drip Irrigation, DryStacked Broken Concrete Terracing, Masonry, Carpentry, Metalwork, Edible Gardening, Food Preservation (solar dehydration, canning), Fruit Tree Pruning, Green Roofs, Greywater, Living Walls, Natural Building (cobb, adobe), Natural Pools, Permaculture, Rainwater Harvesting, Urban Agriculture, Rocket Stoves/Ovens, Solar Power, Conservation Remodeling, and so much more.  





Our facilities will provide a perfect location for school field trips, afterschool programs, regular farmersâ€™ market, as well as special events.  We will become the place to go for cutting edge information and resources to improve our environmental health and urban sustainability.  Designers and contractors will depend on us for the dissemination of ideas and supplies, hopefully inspiring the replication of the model.  DIY people will be empowered by our offerings, and commercial and institutional clients will turn to us for leadership in creating jobs and getting their environmental projects completed with beauty and integrity.  





Los Angeles currently does not have a place like this in the entire county, there are many pieces to the puzzle, and we are putting them together to help accelerate our economic and environmental recovery.","Success in the year 2050 will look like our city has bloomed into a green urban paradise, transforming from industrial decay into creative rejuvenation.  Our water shortages will be eliminated with a healthy watershed, an LA River that is vital and used for recreation and habitat.  Aquifers will be recharged with smart use of rainwater and graywater, while intelligent landscaping will reduce our needs for irrigation.  Urban agriculture will increase local produce, supplementing our diets while creating butterfly and bee habitat.  People will have meaningful work that improves our public health and environmental quality.  Community connectivity will be strengthened with regional hubs replicating our model.

The club and its swimming pool/industrial cistern will be a located next to the LA River sited between industrial uses on vacant land.   Instead of a country club with bermuda grass and membership dues,  the club promotes the idea that environmental wellbeing,  physical and social, is a right.  </p>  


<p>The center piece of the Club is the PLUNGE that is both cistern, swimming pool and art work.  The name PLUNGE harkens back to the great democratic municipal pools. It is a highly engineered ISO shipping container pool with surrounding sitable decks and a builtin digital projection system that will put participants into an image scene with the LA River.  Not incidentally,  the pool is also a massive cistern for industrial building roof waters.  Already, arrangements have been made for procuring up to 50,000 sq. foot of roof waters.   During the first summer of operation, the waters for swimming will most likely be gathered from municipal water supply, though the slight possibility exists that a filtration system may be used to prepare pumped LA River water.  </p>  


<p>The subsequent year or years, all waters will come from industrial building roof nearby.  The cistern/pool is completely selfcontained system within the container, including pumps, valves, filtration and heating with solar supplement.   During winter months waters will be released to landscape as necessary with an automated system.  The technologies of the system will be developed experimentally during the term of the project.   The project is for a two year term with the possibility of a third year.  When the project is finished the PLUNGE is being designed in such a way as to be transportable to another site or situation and set up with 2 days.</p>  


<p>The LA Riverside Country Club is not a club with dues.  Instead, it is a situation where a series of popup events will be held.  There is already an extensive list of ideas that have been generated by the core team members.  Some of the ideas include:  Urban camping for local youth to be held on the site, old time games like horseshoes, badminton, and bocci ball,  educational seminars and design exercises onsite brought by team members or academics with interest in the LA River,  events or meetings of LA River entities who lack a direct meeting place at the river, such as the Friends of the Los Angeles River and the LA Revitalization Corporation.  Music is planned as well as outdoor project.  A series of planned community swim events will be held.</p>  


<p>Ultimately, this project is to demonstrate and test a large scale cistern as an excuse to cool off on the Eastside in summer.</p>  ","<p>The individuals associated with the project have two avenues of connection and work together:</p>





<p>1.  Community activism in Elysian Valley.  In this respect the core resident participants have worked together on several environmental issues.  These include organize a large public response to environmental justice issues with air quality,  doing work to identify and cause watershed violators to be permitted and improve their practices in the local area.</p>





<p>2.  Professional work on design concepts for appropriate landscape and built environments in the LA River region.  The architects and artists on various conceptual plans for LA River centric projects.</p>

3102148,2013148,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ArtsInfrastructure.html,Arts & Culture Infrastructure Initiative ,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>Letâ€™s Create LA â€¦ with a vibrant and thriving arts and culture infrastructure initiative. 


<p>Greater LA has a robust and active cultural scene, with more artists and arts organizations per capita than almost any other region in the country.  LA is also home to a powerful and productive economy that generates billions of dollars a year in a variety of industries, helping to make California the 8thlargest economy in the world. However, as the LA2050 Report indicates, financial support for the arts is weak compared to other major markets.  This deficiency is created by a low number of private culturallyfocused foundations, low levels of corporate sponsorship, and most importantly, a gap that exists between business managers and executives who want to engage with the cultural life of LA.   In contrast to many other regions that have robust Board Placement programs, Arts & Business Councils, and United Arts Funds, LA has very limited programs to prepare for and match business/civic leaders for service on cultural arts nonprofit boards.  LA STAGE Alliance hopes to address these concerns by becoming a robust cultural alliance, providing service to the entire arts, business, and philanthropy community. We have completed the initial research for the Arts & Culture Infrastructure Initiative. A LA2050 grant is needed as â€˜seed moneyâ€™ to allow us to fast track this initiative by piloting test cases, developing program/operations and fundraising plans and creating a network of invested stakeholders through a series of interviews, surveys, convenings and research reports. Our research indicates that the Initiative has the potential to be financially selfsustaining through both earned and contributed revenue after the twoyear pilot phase. 





<p>The Initiative will include the following three components:


<p>1.	Arts & Business Conduit:     


We want to serve as the conduit between the arts and business community. We will build relationships with the top 50 institutions with demonstrated arts board participation from our research.   We will interview key leadership and corporate social responsibility officers on their formal and informal board placement, leadership development and community outreach strategies. Our goal would be for the talented employees of top corporations in the region to be trained on arts board service and be placed with a cultural organization that both matches their interests and expands their understanding of the cultural infrastructure of Greater LA. 


<p>Engaging Los Angelinos with cultural board service by itself is not enough.  We will create ongoing Board Support Networks between board members at cultural organizations for mutual support, similar to support networks in other fields through surveys, communications, convenings and networking events.  Arts nonprofits often run into challenges that their boards do not have knowledge in and may feel at a loss on how to effectively address.  By creating networks between board members  including mentormentee relationships and periodic gatherings of board members/board chairs, etc  major decisionmaking challenges can be addressed with the knowledge base and community support of leaders from across the region. We will consult with national thought leaders in leadership development and arts nonprofit management to create the program design for the Arts & Business Conduit.





<p>2. Regionwide Arts Fund:   


We will develop a plan to create a Region Wide Arts Fund through workplace giving, employeedriven corporate sponsorship support, individual donations from highnetworth individuals and crowd sourced methodologies.   By engaging with the businesses of Greater LA through the Board Placement and Development process, we expect that many LA citizens will be identified who are interested in the cultural landscape of LA, but who are not in a place to engage immediately through Board service.   This component of the program will provide a pathway for those who want to support the LA cultural infrastructure without board service. The funds raised will be distributed through regranting to support parts of LAâ€™s cultural landscape that are often overlooked or underfunded. 





<p>3. Arts & Cultural Alliance Pilot


We will pilot the expansion of our programming, from serving the performing arts predominately to serving the entire arts and culture sector through the following channels: Current Program Outreach, Expansion of LASTAGETimes.com Arts Journalism coverage, and Research and Program Development. This will lead to a new mission, new name/branding and a more robust operation. We would conduct outreach to build awareness of these benefits to an expanded arts population while simultaneously working with the broader community to ascertain what communityspecific services and programs are still needed.</p>","<p>LA STAGE Alliance has provided dozens of services and shorttolong term initiatives over our 30 year history.  A few highlights include:</p>





<p>1. The creation of the LA STAGE ARTS CENSUS, in partnership with TRG Arts, that is now the largest and most robust collective dataset of cultural patrons in LAâ€™s history with over four million unique households currently included.</p>





http://www.laimyours.com/40804/whatisupwithla2050/2.  The creation of the LA PatronManager CRM initiative, providing goldstandard corporate data technology services to arts organizations at zero cost, through a multipronged partnership with a forprofit technology firm (Patron Technology), a corporate foundation (Salesforce Foundation), private foundations (the James Irvine and Doris Duke Charitable Foundations), over 100 nonprofit arts organizations, and a nonprofit service organization (LA STAGE Alliance).</p>





<p>3.  The creation of LA STAGE Magazine in 2001, which moved online to become the awardwinning LASTAGETimes.com in 2009.  It is now guided by EditorinChief Deborah Behrens and is the largest professional journalism outlet in Los Angeles dedicated specifically to indepth, quality coverage of Los Angeles performing arts.</p>





<p>4.  The founding of the LA STAGE Warehouse Coop, a 10,000 square foot shared materials facility for the LA theater community, saving LA theaters thousands of dollars a year and preventing the loss of tons of reusable materials (sets, props, costumes, equipment) that would otherwise be sent to landfills.</p>





<p>5.  The creation of the LA STAGE Ovation Awards, now in their 24th year, the highestprofile awards for excellence in theater on the West Coast.  The Ovation Awards consider over 400 productions each year; celebrate over 150 nominees and 35 Ovation recipients at an annual blacktie ceremony, which is attended by 1300 leaders of the LA cultural community.</p>





<p>6.  Hosting the 2011 Theatre Communications Group Conference in Los Angeles â€“ the first time it had been to LA in its 50 year history â€“ bringing over 1,000 theater professionals from around the country to Downtown LA, in conjunction with the first ever RADAR LA international theater festival.</p>","Weâ€™ll activate the 1000+ arts organizations we currently serve and develop this initiative with our local, regional and national partners who work in this connectivitycollaboration space, including the LA Chamber of Commerce, Arts for LA, municipal cultural agencies, arts funders, service providers and others.  We will also leverage individuals serving on cultural boards, networks of philanthropists and business leaders who support the cultural life of LA. We have strong relationships with national partners who have encouraged us to pursue this Initiative including both Americans for the Arts (their network of Arts & Business Councils, Business Committees for the Arts and United Arts Funds) and National Arts Strategies.","<p>Evaluation will include tracking the following on an annual basis, with the first data being derived from a comparison of the pre and post LA2050 activity period (June 2013 and December 2013).</p>





<p>1. How many individuals, arts organizations, corporations and philanthropic entities are engaged with the Initiative?</p>





<p>2. Have we increased the number of diverse, nonperforming arts entities participating in current LA STAGE Alliance programs.</p>





<p>3. Have we created Program/Operations/Fund Development Plans for all three aspects of the initiative.</p>





<p>4. Have Advisory Councils and Task Force/Working Groups been established with work plans and timelines?</p>





<p>5. What changes in satisfaction occur for nonprofit Executive Directors regarding the participation and support of the Board?</p>





<p>6. What changes in satisfaction occurred for current Board members regarding the participation and support of other Board members?</p>





<p>7. How many Board members of nonprofits met new colleagues (on their Board or on other Boards) through the Initiative?</p>





<p>8. How much funding for cultural organizations was raised and distributed through the regional Arts fund program? How many individuals or organizations participated?</p>





<p>9. What changes in compensation for artists and arts administrators have occurred since the beginning of the Initiative, both within individual organizations and across all participating cultural organizations?</p>","<p>What is particularly exciting about this project is that it will not only impact the Arts & Cultural Vitality indicator, but also the Social Connectedness and Income and Employment indicators.  The core of the Initiative is to build an engaged and active web of relationships between Angelinos and arts and culture nonprofits through arts participation, board volunteerism (Social Connectedness) and philanthropy.  In turn, these engaged citizens will bring more resourcesâ€“ financial and knowledge basedâ€“ to nonprofit cultural organizations and thus improve the success of those organizations. Ultimately, bettersupported arts organizations will help increase compensation and standards of living for artists and arts administrators, which is a significant challenge in the LA cultural landscape.</p>





<p>LA STAGE Allianceâ€™s major strengths are building relationships and aggregating resources. This project is a great example of the work we do.  We have two sectors (forprofit corporate businesses and nonprofit cultural institutions) that could greatly benefit from working together on many levels.   The forprofit employees will have the opportunity to gain skills, network with each other, and become personally invested in the cultural organizations and artists in their communities in a way that is tailored to their individual interests and needs.  The artists and cultural organizations will make huge strides in organizational stability, sharper mission focus and strategic planning by engaging with a new set of talented and trained board members and will thrive with an infusion of new services and funding streams. This Initiative will build a growing set of passionate professionals on both the for and nonprofit sides, who are excited about LAâ€™s cultural landscape.  They will be given the necessary tools to take our current cultural assets and turn them into a powerhouse that will propel Los Angeles into truly being the Cultural Capital of the United States.</p>","<p>Our CEO, Terence McFarland presented the following six components of a vibrant and thriving arts ecology in 2050 at the community meeting on the Arts & Culture Indicator:</p>





<p>1. Multiuse community arts centers exist in every neighborhood with multilingual around the clock program composed of participatory, professionally produced or presented and commercial or purchasable product.</p>





<p>2. The LA region enjoys the highest per capita investment in the arts from Government, Individuals AND the Corporate Sector.</p>





<p>3. Business Leaders from every sector are clamoring to join Arts and Culture Non Profit Boards â€“ Arts groups enjoy a waiting list for potential Board members.</p>





<p>4. All artists are making a living wage.</p>





<p>5. Artists of every discipline are in residence at the top 200 businesses in the region and every major municipal agency.</p>





<p>6. Low income residents enjoy free access to and feel welcomed at any arts experience they choose at all arts organization in the region.</p>





<p>The Board and Giving networks will become a core group of LAâ€™s ecology and civic engagement that participation in them will be a given.  Once you reach a certain level of career progression in any field in Los Angeles, it will be socially presumed that you join your peers in Board service within LAâ€™s cultural nonprofit sector.</p>





<p>After 30+ years of these mutually beneficial relationships taking root, it will be hard to see where â€˜for profitâ€™ businesses end and â€˜nonprofitâ€™ organizations begin.   You will find more for and nonprofit businesses fusing into cooperative ventures beyond sharing board members.  For example, it will become a standard practice for art experiences to be incorporated into the business activities of a store or restaurant.</p>





<p>Participation in our Regional Arts Fund will be so commonplace that it will feel like a tithing at church to all those above the poverty line in the region.</p>





<p>Los Angeles will be known as the Cultural Capital of America  the â€˜Creative Powerhouseâ€™ where a vast economy is driven by creative activities at every level; where business acumen is tightly woven with art to reach higher levels of community impact and artistry.  New generations of cultural innovation will springboard from LA.   The best and brightest minds of Los Angeles will collaborate effortlessly, propel our region forward, and help the LA arts sector grow economically and culturally to inspire all of America and the world.</p>"
3102149,2013149,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/farmonwheels.html,Farm on Wheels, Health,"<p>Farm on Wheels is a distribution system to bring locallygrown, high quality produce to all Los Angeles neighborhoods via a customized fleet of clean, biodiesel trucks. Using a centralized stockhouse for produce storage and a series of trucks to deliver a la carte fruits and vegetables, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) boxes, and locally made artisanal food to communities across the Southland, we will provide access to convenient, healthy food that is essential to good health. With access to fresh produce, Los Angeles residents will be better able to prevent and manage the health concerns of obesity, diabetes, and coronary disease.</p>


<p>Farm on Wheels trucks will serve as traveling hubs of healthy food. Departing from a central facility that stores wholesale produce from local farmers, the trucks will travel to communities across Los Angeles, setting up shop at churches, schools, transit centers, and employment centers, operating as a roving farmerâ€™s market. This model offers advantages over traditional farmers markets, which usually come at high costs to farmers because of the labor involved in transporting and selling their goods. Also, customers that have difficulty reaching their weekly farmers market can now visit the truck that comes multiple times a week to accessible, welltrafficked locations.  </p>


<p>The trucks wonâ€™t just deliver food, but act as vehicles for equity exchange between LAâ€™s geographically and economically varied neighborhoods. Looking at a map of food deserts in Los Angeles, you notice they are heavily concentrated in South and East Los Angeles. It follows that these neighborhoods are also the site of higher rates of obesity and its associated chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Aside from giving residents of these underserved communities access to the farmers markets that are usually reserved for more privileged parts of Los Angeles,  there will be more direct exchanges of equity through subsidized products. For example, patrons purchasing produce with EBT will receive a bonus on every dollar spent at Farm on Wheels. Also, a number of free monthly CSA boxes will be funded through revenue from the sale of artisanal goods and CSA subscriptions. All of these alternative revenue sources will combine to make Farm on Wheels accessible and affordable.</p>


<p>Unhealthy diet leads to obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a host of other chronic diseases. By providing access to fruits and vegetables to the communities that are most in need, Farm on Wheels will help reverse the trend of poor diet and its associated health risks. These trucks can providing the building blocks for a balanced diet that will be the foundation in transforming these food deserts to health havens.</p>","<p>Farm on Wheels is a product of the partnership between LAMÃ¡s and Mia Lehrer + Associates. Since its inception, the partnership between MÃ¡s and MLA has aimed to create sustainable communities comprised of innovative civic buildings, wellplanned open spaces, and green infrastructure. In our combined efforts we employ a diverse method of research, planning, and design. All of our projects begin with a foundational immersive research phase, which uncovers new design considerations  leading to employable, innovative solutions.</p>





<p>In 2010 the founders of LAMÃ¡s, Inc. conducted a threeweek immersive research program in partnershipâ€¨with Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center in which we identified impediments to care for children with cerebral palsy.</p>





<p>Through this research we identified â€¨a need for hospital guidelines that prioritize the provision of spatial accommodations for children who had the greatest physical disabilities. This â€œHierarchy of Needsâ€ document served as a graphic outline for retrofitting childrenâ€™s hospitals in the United States as well as internationally.</p>





<p>Mia Lehrer + Associates most important achievements have been their work on the Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan and Vista Hermosa Park. The Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan aims to transform 32 miles of concretelined river into public green space in the heart of one of Americaâ€™s most populated cities. As a vital work of civic infrastructure, the river has the potential to integrate a divided city. Key civic leaders joined forces to fund a visionary and technical look at changing the river into a new amenity, a source of socioeconomic revitalization and a crucial step towards regreening the â€œCity of Sprawl.â€


ML+A designed Vista Hermosa Park as an urban watershed demonstration project that accommodates community and school recreational programs, integrated with an extensive network of introduced natural features and ecosystems. Located at the edge of a dense residential zone, the park incorporates active recreation including a synthetic turf soccer field, trails, water features, a childrenâ€™s adventure area and picnic areas in native habitat landscapes.</p>


","  <p>     For this project, Mia Lehrer + Associates will be collaborating with Sqirl, and Coolhaus to create an extensive food network that will help supply the best produce and goods for Los Angeles. While we will be handling the design and build of the truck itself, these partners will ensure it stays well stocked.</p>





     <p>      Jessica Koslow runs Sqirl, and she will help assemble the network of farmers and other food providers to get the best prices for a comprehensive produce stock.</p>





        <p>   Freya Estrella and Natasha Case own one of the most successful food truck franchises with Coolhaus. They will contribute to Farm on Wheelsâ€™ business plan, as well as providing seasonal flavors of their Coolhaus sandwiches.</p>","      <p> This projectâ€™s success will be evaluated on the number of customers reached and communities served. Farm on Wheelsâ€™ effectiveness is reliant on the trucks being stable food centers in the communities they serve. It is essential for neighborhood residents to be able to rely on Farm on Wheels as a steady source of affordable produce. So, aside from the typical economic measurements of financial sustainability, we will look at metrics such as number of farmer collaborators, high income vs. low income customers, and value above replacement of similarly priced food. By looking at these more informative statistics, we will be able to better serve the communities we engage with.</p>





      <p>     With the multiple revenue streams of CSA subscriptions, a la carte sales, and catering, Farm on Wheels will have diversified funds to support our mission of providing access to healthy food. The subscriptions themselves will provide a steady, predictable income stream that will allow us to thoughtfully expand to more trucks and more neighborhoods. As we add more trucks and more communities gain access, we will able to better tailor our goods to each individual neighborhood. These types of decisions and details will be informed by the previously mentioned statistics, as well as community surveys outreach.</p>





      <p>     Ultimately, we will measure our success by the shrinking area of food deserts. It is the ultimate goal of Farm on Wheels to ensure all Angelenos have access to healthy, affordable food, and over time we hope to see the dissipation of all food deserts.</p>","       Farm on Wheels will benefit Los Angeles by creating new community hubs that provide Angelenos access to healthy, affordable food. Like farmers markets, each truck will serve as a place for people to have a more handson experience with food shopping.  





        Many residents of our city are currently denied access to fresh produce despite living near some of the most productive and diverse farmlands in the world. A lack of capital, resources, and mobility have combined to create large areas of Los Angeles with few grocery stores and an excess of fast food chains. Farm on Wheels will provide healthy alternatives to the processed foods that dominate lowincome areas and give more frequent access to farm fresh produce to those who canâ€™t make it to their weekly farmers market.





       In the long term, this access will translate into better health outcomes for customers. Steady sources of fruits and vegetables will supplement diets dominated by unhealthy, processed foods. Substituting in these healthy alternatives will help in the fight against obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.





       We envision Farm on Wheels as a roaming community hub. Through affiliations with community gardens and local farmers, we will facilitate produce exchanges and the sale of low cost goods to encourage community agriculture. Another community benefit will be educational programming that teaches kids the benefits of healthy eating and localized agriculture. All of this activity at the cart will strengthen community bonds and provide new ways for people to connect with food. ","       Success in 2050 is a healthy Los Angeles. On a statistical level this means lower rates of diabetes, childhood obesity, asthma, and poor cardiac health, but more tangibly, a healthy Los Angeles would offer all its residents an integrated health system that takes into account all factors that influence health. This vision for a holistic health system includes the expansion of health clinics that offer affordable care to prevent minor issues from becoming severe health problems and providing the resources to manage and remediate chronic conditions.





    In addition to outstanding and responsive healthcare facilities, the city of LA will provide infrastructure that encourages healthy lifestyles. The construction of subways, trains, bike lanes and other transit options has begun to transition the city from its carcentric ways and will contribute to a less polluted environment. Similarly, an increased focus on public green space will ensure children form healthy habits of regular exercise and an active lifestyle. It is essential for the city to provide the infrastructure to promote population health.





       Just as important as a healthoriented government is an active and motivated citizenry. The year 2050 in Los Angeles will have a completely transformed food landscape.  Localized food sources in the form of large community gardens will empower citizens to grow their own food and free them from a fluctuating food market. Also, community agriculture will encourage a healthy diet centered on fruits and vegetables, as opposed to the current prevalence of processed foods.





The combination of healthy diets and active public spaces will transform Los Angeles on a grand scale. Health discrepancies between rich and poor will be reduced and the whole population will be able to take part in the cityâ€™s progress and growth. "

This class will prepare and empower them with financial literacy and the ability to respect and understand the distinction between spending money and using money, becoming effective citizens in a global economic society.





The overall impact will teach inner city youth traditionally underexposed to the tools of financial literacy, 1) how to use a bank effectively, 2) the importance of credit, 3) saving your money vs. spending your money, 4) why all money is not â€œgood money,"" and 5) money and college.


","As a nonprofit organization we cater to the female youth through our programming. Through our philanthropy ""TIJERAS,"" cutting through to enhance education opportunities, we fundraise hundreds of dollars every year to donate to another nonprofit organization which carries out this purpose on a grander scale. We also serve our community through our Annual Latina Youth Leadership Conferences that are targeted to middle and high school students. We offer these students workshops about AG Requirements, resume building, networking, mental health, and student panels among many others. Overall our organization encourages students to pursue a higher education and we offer them the tools and support to do so.",0,"Evaluation of the project will be in the form of weekly student activity logs, pre and post surveys, quizzes, and monitoring of the students. Our success will be measured by monitoring student participation in the weekly student activities and workshops, success of the students in using their money effectively during workshops and activities, as well as their scores from the prequiz to the post quiz for the program.","Statistics from the California High School Performance Reports presented by the State Department of Education indicate that only 63.5% of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) students graduate from high school. Those scoring above 50 percentile is even less. One area school, Fairfax High, has only a fouryear competition rate of 42.3%. Without intervention, many of those students will drop out of school; many more will graduate without the necessary skills needed to succeed in life. Our classes will enable students to enter the workforce with more positive and realistic aspirations. Students statistically expected to underachieve will be empowered to do the opposite.","In the year 2050 this group of students would have reached out to two more generations of students developing their financial enrichment, thus advancing the effect of this program implemented in 2013. Los Angeles will see that more high school students are prepared with the ability to understand and use different aspects of banking, money, and credit and its relation to personal income."
3102151,2013151,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LASPROMISE.html,LAs Promise: Improving Schools Empowering Neighborhoods, Education,"LA's Promiseâ€™s mission is to improve the education, health, and social outcomes for thousands of youth and families living in one South Los Angeles community, the LA's Promise Neighborhood. By 2050, LAâ€™s Promise will have transformed South LAâ€™s schools to have produced 30 years of successful high school and college graduates and will have rolled out its transformative model across Los Angelesâ€™ underserved schools. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of alumni LAâ€™s Promise will have supported by 2050 will be successful adults giving back to their home community of South LA, which will have shifted from decades of urgent need to a time of prosperous leadership and middle class prosperity.





LAâ€™s Promiseâ€™s model is its Big Idea: we transform chronically failing public schools and open new schools, both with the underlying philosophy that schools in underserved areas must become community hubs that offer comprehensive support services for students and families. Since its founding, LAâ€™s Promise has become a national leader in the movement to improve public schools. We demonstrate significantly increased student achievement, and our model is scalable to an entire communityâ€™s children. LAâ€™s Promise has created a new operating protocol for outside organizations to run LAUSD schools, and it is the first communitybased organization in LA history to operate noncharter public schools, proving its effectiveness at scale. LA's Promise works directly with students, schools, and the LAUSD and also screens and manages more than 70 partners who support our school communities by providing more than 200 wraparound services. 





Recognizing that a young personâ€™s educational achievement reflects a myriad of familial, communal, environmental, psychological, social, health, and physical influences, LAâ€™s Promise combines numerous integrated services to meet each studentsâ€™ individual needs. 





Our unique approach is exemplified by two critical elements.


1. LAâ€™s Promise schools are not charter schools: they are neighborhood public schools run by LAâ€™s Promise under a performancebased contract with LAUSD. They are open to every neighborhood child.


2. LAP leverages the community access of school buildings to turn them into community focal points designed to improve all aspects of area life. As the hub of more than 200 wraparound services provided by partners we rigorously recruit, screen, and manage, LAâ€™s Promise schools provide comprehensive support to children and families.





LAâ€™s Promise programs are all built on four areas of school and community turnaround: 


 School Culture Transformation: Before any academic improvements can take root, a schoolâ€™s culture must be transformed. LAâ€™s Promise relies on a handful of key strategies to promote a welcoming, safe learning environment across its campuses. Strategies include: creating a culture of high expectations, developing school safety teams, implementing a uniform policy (the first at a noncharter LAUSD school); and adhering to researchbased, consistent polices on disciplinary issues.


 Innovative, Rigorous Instruction: Our philosophy embodies several guiding principals, including: high expectations for all students and staff, a datadriven and systemic approach to all aspects of instruction, and a culturally responsive pedagogy. LAâ€™s Promise educators provide curricular support to LAUSD staff and to all students outside of minimal class time requirements. 


 Efficient and Effective School Management: LAâ€™s Promise strategically invests in the human capital at each school by providing the ongoing professional development and support necessary for our teachers to become entrepreneurial, strategic, and visionary thinkers. 


 Wraparound Services: LAâ€™s Promise turns each school into a community hub for delivering essential services all day long. LAâ€™s Promise today works with over 70 nonprofit organizations that collectively provide more than 200 free services to students, their families, and community residents. Services run the gamut from tutoring, to legal assistance and arts programs, to health services.





LAâ€™s Promise will use $100,000 across its powerful programs, leveraging the funding to help more than 6,000 middle and high school students in one of LAâ€™s most underserved communities. This will plant the seed for a powerful vision of change by 2050. These 6,000 students will plant the seeds of a bright tomorrow for the region, and LAâ€™s Promise will hone and enhance its work towards a continued broad impact for decades to come.


","By transforming the culture at each of our schools, LAâ€™s Promise has already demonstrated success across our metrics, including early and dramatic gains at both high schools.





 API Scores have risen 10%, or 57 points, at Manual Arts High School in the two years LAâ€™s Promise has managed the school and 21%, or an impressive 111 points, at West Adams High School in five years. In 20112012 alone, the most recent data year available, the overall API across LAâ€™s Promise schools rose by 52 points. Manual Arts experienced a 21point increase and John Muir a 31point increase.


 Fouryear graduation rates increased by 6% over three years at Manual Arts and 11% over five years at West Adams. 


 The important indicators of ELA and Math Proficiency have increased across the board. The percentage of students that passed at Proficient or Advanced on the ELA California Standardized Test jumped 43% (from 19.6% to 31.2%) at Manual Arts in the three years LAP has managed the school, and increased 36% in five years (from 15.5% to 24.1%) at West Adams. Meanwhile, the percentage of students that passed Proficient or Advanced on the Math California Standardized Test rose a very dramatic 66% (from 3.2% to 5.3%) at Manual Arts in three years and 77% (from 2.4% to 10.6%) at West Adams in five years. Proficient or Advanced scores at John Muir also increased, including ELA scores increasing by 19% (from 23% to 27.3%) and Math scores increasing by 33% (from 18% to 24%) since LAP management.


 Over the last three years, the schools average 94% attendance rates. As of today, West Adams itself now has one of the highest attendance rates (nearly 92%) and lowest dropout rates (2.3%) in LAUSD. Manual Arts and John Muir also have LAUSDtopping attendance rates of 93% and 96%, respectively.


 The number of instructional days lost to suspensions have dropped by 69.6% at Manual Arts, 59.8% at West Adams and 27.3% at John Muir since LAP management began.


 Seniors at West Adams Prep accepted to a fouryear college more than tripled from 9% to 39% over 5 years and seniors at Manual Arts accepted to a fouryear college more than doubled, from 18% to 40% in only two years. A full 100% of the recent Manual Arts High School graduates were admitted to a two or fouryear college.





Perhaps most importantly: we are proud to say that, as of this writing our graduates are attending fouryear colleges and universities including California Institute of Tech (Cal Tech); Colgate University; Harvard; University of California, Berkeley; University of Southern California; California State University, Los Angeles; and many, many more. 


","LAâ€™s Promise operates its program onsite at the following school campuses in South Los Angeles:


Manual Arts High School


West Adams Preparatory High School


John Muir Middle School





In addition, LAâ€™s Promise works with more than 70 communitybased organizations and corporations to deliver its wraparound services. These include: 826LA, Upward Bound, City Year, Brotherhood Crusade, Teach for America, Sparks, the YMCA, St. Johnâ€™s Well Child and Family Center, LA Child Guidance Center, USC Trio, UCLA Outreach, various California State University outreach coordinators, the American Heart Association and more.


","LAâ€™s Promise measures success largely through our increased high school graduation and college attendance rates. As more students cycle through LAâ€™s Promiseâ€™s programs, we anticipate an increase in college graduation rates.





Our instructional programs and strategies are measured and monitored through a comprehensive Performance Matrix that tracks, among other things, graduation rates, attendance rates, suspension rates, standardized test scores, college matriculation and job placement details, incidents of violence and campus disruption, grades across subject areas, individual grades, school performance scores, and more. The goal of the matrix is to: identify systemic issues and barriers, highlight successful strategies and potential solutions, and empower schools to make better, databased decisions. The matrix reflects goals and academic targets established by LA's Promise, LAUSD, and each school. Three times a year, our instructional team and school leadership review student data to assess student progress, refine instructional practices, and realign resources. Emphasis is placed on academic intervention, credit recovery and meeting collegeprep course requirements. The data used to inform this process comes from periodic assessments, grade analysis, and diagnostic testing. The executive leadership and school administrators monitor academic outcomes, report findings to the Board, and share findings with staff during biannual staff retreats. In addition, school sites engage in regular Data Dialogues with teachers and departments to ensure they are fully aware of and respond to individual student progress as well as department trends.





Service program evaluations are planned and conducted by LA's Promise staff. Inhouse process evaluations are utilized to examine the degree to which each program reflects the original implementation plan. LA's Promise evaluations focus on promoting accountability and broadening the organizations knowledge base. In coordination with our Director of Data and Strategy, program staff evaluate each program's impact through: (i) the examination of public statistics and LAUSD data, (ii) participation tracking and surveys, and (iii) observations. Evaluation findings and program improvements are monitored by the executive leadership, reported to the Board, and shared across the organization during biannual staff retreats. 


","The zip code of a childâ€™s home should not determine their academic success, let alone their future. In the next 5 years alone, LAâ€™s Promise will expand to feeder schools to create a comprehensive K12 community and educational infrastructure serving more than 20,000 children and their families at flagship high schools we have helped improve. By 2050, this work will have changed our region, and through all of it, LAâ€™s Promise aims to prepare every child it serves to be college and careerready, healthy, and successful in life.





Based on its core vision, LAâ€™s Promise focuses on six hallmark programs, each of which will be brought to benefit at least 6,000 students in the shortterm and tens of thousands more in the years to come:


 Innovative Education, which implements researchbased programs including Blended Learning that links technology to learning; Linked Learning that advances careerbased learning; and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) careerthemed educational and study tracks.


 Go for College, which works with partners to create a collegegoing culture for all students by providing college tours; assisting with financial aid, application, and college fair processes; and by generally exposing the student body to an array of public and private colleges and universities. 


 Teachers & Leaders, which provides professional development and instructional support to teachers and administrators to offer highquality education to every student in every class.


 7 to 7 offers an array of before and afterschool programs designed to make the school site a trusted and enriching community hub from 7am to 7pm every day, and often for hours beyond. 


 Promise Parents, which offers ongoing parent education courses, volunteer and leadership opportunities, and consistent and ongoing parent communication to ensure parents are aware of the steps to take to secure their child's education success. 


 Health & Wellness, which has developed three primary activities to ensure access to fundamental health services for every student at an LA's Promise school: (i) health, vision, and dental screenings; (ii) restructuring and supplementing health, PE courses, and activities related to nutrition; and (iii) coordinating health and fitness trainings for parents and youth to promote wellness and disease prevention. 





Through all of its efforts, LAâ€™s Promise will work to prepare every child in LAâ€™s Promise Neighborhood to be successful, resulting in entire communities being transformed as these children move into successful adult lives. In the coming year the LAâ€™s Promise Neighborhood will see the return of its first set of college graduates, most of whom will also be the firstever college graduates in their families. LAâ€™s Promise has designed its model to be scalable; in the longterm, the benefits will expand beyond the specific geographic focus of the LAâ€™s Promise Neighborhood to reach underserved and lowincome communities across LA.","As noted above, by 2050, LAâ€™s Promise will have transformed South LAâ€™s schools to have produced more than 35 years of successful high school and college graduates and will have rolled out its transformative model across Los Angelesâ€™ underserved schools. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of alumni LAâ€™s Promise will have supported by 2050 will be successful adults giving back to their home community of South LA, which will have shifted from decades of urgent need to a time of prosperous leadership.





Generally, we believe that success in 2050 for Education in Los Angeles would include:


	95% graduation rates across all schools in South Los Angeles, and a minimum of 75% graduation rates across the schools in all of the communities of Los Angeles;


	95% college attendance rates across the students graduating from LAâ€™s Promise schools;


	96% school attendance rates across the schools in lowincome communities of Los Angeles;


	All Los Angeles schools serving as community hubs and resources, involving entire families and communities in the education of its children;


	A unified pipeline of schools, beginning with prekindergarten, that meet the needs of 100% of the families and communities all across the Los Angeles region; and


	LAâ€™s Promise graduates returning to work in the communities where they grew up and serving as mentors to current students and as advocates for the LAâ€™s Promise model across the region. 





By 2050, LAâ€™s Promise will have graduated more than 500,000 youth and sent them on to pursue college and professional careers. 





"
3102152,2013152,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LAUPPreschool.html,LAUP/LA2050 Preschool Research Project, Education,"LAUP will use the LA2050 Education Grant to initiate the first phase of a thorough research study on the impacts and outcomes of quality preschool for a test group of students. These outcomes will demonstrate how investing in early education now will make LA a better place in 2050 by dramatically improving our education system starting from the students up.





Science has proven that 90% of a childâ€™s brain development occurs by age five, but less than 4% of public investment in education occurs by that time. 





LAâ€™s education system is in crisis, with a shameful lack of state funding making a bad situation worse, year after year. California is 47th in the nation in per-pupil expenditure and 49th in class size, with LA driving that statistic as the largest school district in the state. Leading education experts agree we must prioritize our investment in high quality preschool and early education programs to see the highest ROI and societal impact.





James Heckman, University of Chicago Economics Professor and Nobel Laureate in Economics, has appeared before Congress with the assertion that â€œa large body of economic, health and social science data makes it clear that early childhood education is more than a social imperative; it is an economic one that has far reaching implications for our nation.â€ 





So if the experts agree, why isnâ€™t anything being done about this crisis?  LAUP recently contracted a third party to conduct dozens of focus groups whose findings substantiated the general misunderstanding about the long-term societal and economic benefits of quality preschool among various LA demographic groups.  Without this basic understanding of what it really means for our city, state and nation to educate our population early and well, the type of funding that can only come about through voter approval of new legislation is unlikely to occur anytime soon.





Therefore, LAUP will use the funds from LA250 to launch a research project of a scope that has not been attempted in Los Angeles to date.  The standard for preschool outcomes research, the Perry Preschool Project of 1962, is still used today as the primary reference of early education investigators. Using leading expertise in the field, we will conduct updated research, using modern metrics and assessments that take into consideration the differences in learning environment and societal influences our young learners have today.  


For the study, LAUP will select a quality preschool in LA using our 5-Star Quality Rating and Improvement System. This rating system is currently being used as the model for a state-wide preschool rating system that is being developed as part of the Federal Race to the Top grant that LAUP was awarded last year. An independent third-party research firm will collect data to determine how a quality preschool experience affects concrete factors such as community improvement, school readiness, future academic achievement, future income, and health. 





LA2050â€™s support will fund the first year, or Phase 1 of a recommended three year project which would extend through the end of the subjectsâ€™ second grade year. At that time, the students will begin participation in California standardized testing and can be assessed across large groups of their peers. Phase 1 of the project will yield valuable data on the effects of preschool in LA and the studentsâ€™ kindergarten readiness as compared with their non-preschool, or lower quality preschool peers.  This data will be immediately applicable to funders for future research and policy debate.  The next three years of the study, would complete a data set for all participating children so that outcomes could be assessed from age 4 through 7.  A thorough study, equal to the breadth of the Perry Preschool Project, would follow the subjects into adulthood.


Along with these advanced research techniques, LAUP plans to use a new social media aspect to the study. While remaining cognizant of the privacy of all of the participants involved, we will provide a way for students, teachers, and parents to document their experiences in LAâ€™s schools. This incorporates a community aspect to the study, inviting public discourse and attention, inclusivity, and shared responsibility. This interactive documentation provides an ongoing record of the childâ€™s learning and gives value to his or her experiences. 





This new study will not only elevate LA as a leading innovator in early education research and advocacy, but will gain the public and government support to pressure our legislators into substantially funding early education, starting at a local level, and ultimately informing our state, and national discourse on education reform. We must start by investing in our youngest citizens.  It must start with preschool.


","Since 2005, Los Angeles Universal Preschool (LAUP) has supported the operation and/or development of more than 325 preschools in Los Angeles County, touching the lives of more than 60,000 children through enriching curricula and nurturing environments aimed to best prepare children to succeed in kindergarten and beyond.


LAUP is a non-profit that was initially created in 2004 by First 5 LA, our primary funder, to fund preschool for four-year-olds in Los Angeles County. First 5 LA was created by the California Children and Families First Initiative of 1998 (Proposition 10). This voter-approved initiative increased the tax on cigarettes by 50 cents per pack and dedicated the funding to early childhood education and health programs for children ages 0-5.





These are some highlights of our 2011-2012 accomplishments:





More than 10,000 children received quality preschool experience. 





Over 975 children with special needs received a quality preschool experience.





29 LAUP coaches provided one-on-one quality improvement and professional training to more than 1,752 preschool teachers.





71 preschools provided obesity prevention education to 2,600 students.





Over 1,000 active students and professionals were enrolled in LAUP workforce programs providing support and services for continued education towards a career in early child education.





Over 1,300 parents completed advocacy training and are better prepared to actively engage as preschool advocates for their children and community.





11 parents participated in meetings in Sacramento and Washington D.C. with their elected officials to advocate fot early childhood education.





422 center-based and family child care providers from across Los Angeles County received career and quality coaching and 1,965 attended trainings.








LAUP provides a multitude of services, including:


â€¢	Providing financial backing and a business structure for preschool providers to improve existing preschools. 


â€¢	Coaching support and mentoring by experienced educators to enhance quality and fiscal stability among LAUP preschools, and boost the involvement of parents in their child's preschool experience. 


â€¢	Giving parents choices about where to send their child to preschool. LAUP preschools include private, public, charter, faith-based and family home care programs. 


â€¢	Increasing access to preschool for thousands of children in Los Angeles County by providing the operating funds needed to fill previously empty classrooms. 


","LAUP will work in collaboration with a carefully selected quality preschool provider, based on evaluation by our 5-Star Quality Rating and Improvement System.  Additionally, we will contract with a private, third-part research firm, so as to remove any conflicts of interest.","The proposed project is itself, a detailed and rigorous evaluation, both immediate and long term, of the impacts of a quality preschool experience on individuals and society. But the specific success of this study will be the revelation of new, comprehensible data, and the subsequent education and involvement of the public on the outcomes of these findings in order to inspire action and lasting change in policy.","In the year 2050, LA will need to rely on an exceptionally well-educated population to continue to compete as a world class, industry-leading city. With the world economy shifting from Europe to Asia over the coming decades, LA is geographically poised to be a major leading influence in the worldâ€™s economy. 





But right now, our education system is in peril, and the societal consequences show up in our crime rates, graduation rates, income levels, and subsequently the overall strength of our economy. With this research project establishing LA as a leader in early education research and advocacy, we have the chance to restore our education system and emerge with a strong and thriving middle class. Previous research shows us that early education funding can save at least $14,716 per child just in crimes never committed, reduced justice system costs, increased tax income due to higher earnings, reduced need for special education services, and reduced welfare costs. 





LA has specific challenges to overcome and local research will help us to develop program to target LAâ€™s deficiencies. Minorities are LAâ€™s fastest growing population. LAUSD is approximately 73.4% Hispanic. Minority populations have the greatest disadvantages in our school system, as do English-language learners.  At the same time, the benefits of a preschool education tend to be most pronounced with minority children of lower socio-economic status, with specific benefits in bridging the gap between English and non-English language learners. 





The US is projected to become a minority-majority nation by 2043, and minorities, now 37% of the U.S. population, are projected to reach 57% of the population in 2060. With L.A. County projected to increase by almost 3.5 million residents in 2050.





Quality research on early education will help us to establish our place in the global economy. LAâ€™s students are already at a major disadvantage to our fastest growing competitors. In 2009, US science and math scores came in behind 22 other nations, including China, Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Hungary, Canada, Finland, and Estonia. While other nations are improving, US test scores remain stagnant. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan recently told a room full of science and math experts of the National Science Board, ""We are lagging the rest of the world, and we are lagging it in pretty substantial ways . . . It has huge implications. I think as a real economic imperative, we have to educate our way to a better economy.""





We need to focus our efforts on the educational infrastructure now, and close the achievement gap to avoid a situation in which our largest population is the least well-educated. We could lead the nation as one of the worldâ€™s most desirable places to live, invest, and partner, because of communities that rank as the safest and most desirable in the nation, and have a top-ranking education system that produces socially responsible and well-educated people.","In the year 2050, our vision is an LA where every child has access to high-quality preschool. We will have moved from one of the lowest performing and lowest funded school districts in the nation, to one of the top five. All children in LA will have the opportunity to make thriving academic achievements, giving them the freedom and ability to become high-achieving adults. LA will be one of the leading cities in education reform, and our preschools will be models for the rest of the nation. LA will become a desirable destination for young professionals and businesses. A well-educated population will contribute to a general LA culture that places a high value on education at every level as well as an involved community whose activism will not stand for a crisis in education to ever take place again. All of these factors will contribute to an environment wherein both voters and policymakers make funding education at all levels, THE main priority instead of a place where politicians consistently look to make deep cuts.





Our population will be diverse and well-educated. Women and minorities will be fully represented in leading industries at all levels. LA will rival the worldâ€™s best cities in industry, creativity, innovation, and education.

In collaboration, we produce new artwork that takes conceptual and material risks; work that is unlikely to be realized within the traditional museum setting, but is an important part of the story of L.A.â€™s dynamic art scene. A key component of our artistcentered programming, LA Public Domain (L.A.P.D.) art initiatives literally bring art out of the gallery space and to the streets. The program provides a platform and support for aspiring and critical public interventions that engage diverse audiences and respond directly to urban spaces. Aligned with the LA2050 approach, L.A.P.D. shares the innovations of the next generation in new and exciting frameworks; this year, two sculptural installations in public parks, five billboards across the city, and a commissioned mural on our own building faÃ§ade. 





The 2013 L.A.P.D. showcases LAXARTâ€™s unique programming model and continues our record of success in the public domain. Los Angelesbased artist Anna Sew Hoy has proposed a sitespecific sculptural public art installation at Kings Road Park in West Hollywood. Responding to the parkâ€™s constellationlike design with a water fountain, waterfall, jungle gym, and seating, Hoy will create a dimensional work made of glazed stoneware, painted hoops, and an embedded mirror to highlight the act of seeing, offering passersby a viewfinder, a mirror reflection, and an opaque silhouette. Visitors will be able to see something new every time they visit by reflecting different views as they navigate the natural surroundings. LAXART will also produce the first public artwork with L.A. artist Sam Falls. Inspired by the history of minimalist sculpture and an interest in photography, he is creating a postminimalist aluminum sculpture with paint that fades in the sunlight over time. A sitespecific work weighing approximately 250 pounds, the piece will have colored panels that could shift from dark to light over the course of a day.  The work will be installed in conjunction with a major exhibition, billboard project, and publication at LAXART in November, and may remain onsite for as long as two years.   





Billboard art has been a signature of LAXART since 2006. Whether an element of an artistâ€™s first solo exhibition or as part of a major regional survey, billboards allow artists to break from tradition and share their ideas in largescale. In 2013, five L.A.P.D. artists will be added to a list that includes Raymond Pettibon, Walead Beshty, Mungo Thomson, Doug Aitken, Mark Bradford, Charlie White, Kate Costello, Roy Dowell, Fay Ray, Meg Cranston, Harrell Fletcher, and more.





LAXARTâ€™s Culver City site has always had a direct relationship with the street and that expressive presence connects community members with the work. The first painting on the faÃ§ade, by Daniel Joseph Martinez, presented a composed text that read, â€œbeautyâ€¦ it rubs against oneâ€™s tongue it hangs there hurting one insisting on its own existence finally it gets so one cannot stand the pain then one must have beauty extracted.â€ This project became a part of the identity of the space, as an emblem for the organization that creates dialogue inside and out. Since then, artists such as Karl Haendel, Sanya Kantarovsky, Dianna Molzan, and the renowned L.A. collective Slanguage, have used the faÃ§ade as their canvas. In 2013, a new L.A.P.D. wall mural on our La Cienega building will be viewed by thousands of drivers and pedestrians traversing on the iconic L.A. thoroughfare.





The L.A.P.D. program impacts L.A.â€™s arts and cultural vitality in the longterm, as it explores the myriad ways that artists speak to audiences and expands the field of how they make work. Each new project gives new perspective on current practices and reveals how city audiences are engaging with the work. LAXART continues to question of the validity of given contexts for the exhibition of contemporary art, architecture, and design. As the forum evolves, we can work toward a new, progressive exhibition modeled after L.A.P.D., with a range of work that lives in the L.A. cityscape with vast accessibilityâ€”instead of entering a formal institution to find art, locals walk out their front door and encounter art as they go about their day. This momentum is building toward our most significant exhibition to date, The Occasional, a citywide initiative based on international artist residencies and newly commissioned work in experimental contexts throughout the city that give the public opportunities for interaction with artists from around the world. 


","Since its founding in 2005, LAXART has realized over 200 projects with artists such as Walead Beshty, Glenn Kaino, William Leavitt, Daniel Joseph Martinez, Yunhee Min, Ruben Ochoa, Mark Bradford, Nicole Miller, Thomas Lawson, Kori Newkirk, Michael Queenland, Wade Guyton & Kelley Walker, Charles Gaines, Lisa Tan, Harrell Fletcher, Torolab, Leslie Hewitt, Vishal Jugdeo, and Kamrooz Aram. LAXART continues to support creative pioneers by anchoring programming around commissions of work that takes conceptual and material risks and inspires community dialogue. LAXART is dedicated to giving emerging artmakers their first solo exhibition and works in tandem with them to realize interventions in the public domain.





The organizationâ€™s landmark project was the 2012 Performance and Public Art Festival, coorganized with the Getty Foundation under the umbrella of the major regionwide initiative, Pacific Standard Time: L.A. Art 194580. The 11day festival featured new public artworks throughout the city; a dramatic sampling of the largescale spectacles, expansive performances, and smallscale interventions that punctuated the history of postwar art in Los Angeles. In addition, new performances premiered each day, including outdoor visual spectacles, experimental theater and sound art, social and political interventions, and media art. A nightly afterparty, Black Box, provided a space for socializing, and included surprise performances each evening.





LAXART welcomes the community to interact with contemporary art as part of the everyday through L.A.P.D. initiatives. Our programming is central to the history of public art in L.A. Highlights include: Ruben Ochaâ€™s 2006 Extracted Freeway Wall Intervention, a photographic image of a Los Angeles landscape stretched on and interrupting a freeway wall; Jedediah Cesarâ€™s Gleanerâ€™s Stone, a resin sculpture temporarily sited at the NE corner of Washington Blvd. and Marcasel Avenue in Culver City as part of the 2008 California Biennial; Doug Aitkenâ€™s Migration, the acclaimed artistâ€™s first monumental public project in L.A. seen from Santa Monica Boulevard at Almont Drive in 2009; Joel Kyackâ€™s Superclogger, a mobile theatre mounted in the back of a pickup truck, which traveled all around Los Angeles to the surprise of other motorists in summer 2010; and Piero Goliaâ€™s Luminous Sphere, a blue globe mounted on the top of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood in 201011. 


",L.A.P.D.â€”LA Public Domain encompasses LAXARTâ€™s public art initiatives with support from ForYourArt.,"Our approach to evaluation is through a selfstudy process.  LAXART measures the success of its exhibitions and education efforts via regularly scheduled curatorial meetings and evaluation sessions amongst staff, advisory board members, and executive board members. We gather press reviews, attendance figures, and comments from the general public, participating artists, curators, and scholars. The director and curators assemble a summary evaluation plan that includes each yearâ€™s accomplishments and activities and submits the document to the governance committee for review.





LAXART will evaluate L.A.P.D. in quantitative and qualitative terms. Beyond our ability to realize the planned number of works at the proposed sites with the purpose and quality intended, we will track attendance at interactive events with artists and invite feedback from participants. As attendance figures arenâ€™t plausible for public projects, we will gather critical press and analyze online traffic to determine public opinion and impact. Comments from LAXART visitors will also help us to determine the relevance and viability of the work on our building and billboard, and give us direction for their improvement of the overall program moving forward.  


","Many major cities have flourishing public art programs that help define the urban landscape and build awareness of contemporary art and culture, yet Los Angeles is lacking in this arena. Through L.A.P.D., LAXART is filling this gap by bringing art to the streets, and inspiring residents to engage with the work. Public artworks can change misconceptions about contemporary art and grow new and diverse audiences, as the art experience changes from a static gallery visit to an organic encounter that is meaningful and inspires dialogue. We are developing a larger audience for the arts in L.A. outside the traditional viewing context, and with repeated exposure, a public that feels ownership of and embraces artwork that emerges locally.





L.A.P.D. benefits Los Angeles artists and audiences. The program gives working artists the opportunity to experiment with new methods and media and to consider their work as part of their home environment. Such projects will help L.A. to sustain its position as a hub for art and culture, and allow us to train and retain the next generation of visual artists, knowing that there are possibilities for their creative practice that await beyond the norm. The LA2050 public projects, including two sculptural installations, five billboards, and a painted building faÃ§ade are part of an ongoing effort to enhance open spaces. Commissions will add to the character of the city, and we hope that local residents will more readily welcome art in their lives with increased exposure in the public sphere. The city will enjoy a larger audience for contemporary art, as the expansion of L.A.P.D will prepare residents to receive the extensive body of work that LAXART will present in The Occasional in 2015. 


","A thriving artist community would be evidence of a healthy Los Angeles in 2050. The culture is at its best when bolstered by the influx of young artists eager to train at our worldclass schools and technical centers, launch their careers amidst a diverse fraternity of creative contemporaries, and define our living landscape with distinctive public artworks. We want to create sustainable program for a new generation of artists and curators living and working in our city. As the Foundation reported, L.A. is currently home to the largest concentration of working artists in the nation, and we hope to establish an infrastructure that can encourage and support their work and allow for a steady growth in the artist population. The arts sector needs to multiply in tandem, with a contingent of professionals and organizations as resources for the diverse artmakers who will come to our city from around the world, seeking the freedom to share their ideas in a form that represents their vision and skill. 





Our overarching goal for initiatives like L.A.P.D. is to firm a foundation for a community of future Angelenos with an appreciation for contemporary art and a strong commitment to its presence around the city. We foresee a revitalized Los Angeles with public art that enriches cultural life and reflects our position as one of the worldâ€™s premier contemporary art destinations. We would have a resident public that is financially and passionately invested in cultural organizations, recognizing the benefit of todayâ€™s art to the community. With a patronage that rivals that of New York, Los Angeles can flourish as the cultural hub that its artists deserve. 





In terms of our own organization, LAXART is working now to strengthen its future position in the artistic ecosystem. We are dedicated to building our internal capacity so that we can cultivate an expert contingent of curators and serve as many artists as possible; those working locally, nationally, and internationally. A successful LAXART in 2050 is an entity that remains independent and works outside the bureaucracy. Keeping pace with artistic growth, we aim to expand and transform our space into a laboratory for working residencies, with studio space, performance space, and gallery space, as well as a library and archive. 





Knowing LAXARTâ€™s value to artists as an autonomous entity, we hope that the 2050 L.A. is home to a network of independent organizations that can match the demands of our cityâ€™s arts community. Like LAXART, these organizations would be willing to take risks alongside artists and produce cuttingedge work that redefines the art of the time. Our work cannot be replicated by major art institutions; it requires close collaboration in an intimate setting and an open forum free of institutional restraints. Our community would experience a diversity of offerings that matches the vast ethnicity of the regional population, as new voices and cultures would be integrated into the mix.

<ul>


<li>Aim to improve the current Learn To Be model of free, oneonone, online tutoring for underserved communities</li>


<li>Implement an Adaptive and Persistent Problem Module (APPM) for students and integrate it into online classroom</li>


<li>Provide practice problems in almost any math, science and language arts topic </li>


<li>Track time needed for student to complete each problem </li>


<li>Create adaptive algorithm, in which problems get more difficult based on previous correct answers or easier based on previous incorrect answers and adapts to studentsâ€™ academic needs</li>


<li>Store studentsâ€™ answers in a database for future recall by tutors; different tutors will have access to same data for student so no ambiguity on what one tutor worked on with a student vs. another</li>


<li>Each oneonone session can now be more specifically tailored to the needs of students, targeting exactly what the student needs help with and honing in on fundamental deficiencies</li>


</ul>











<p><b>PROJECT DETAILS</b></p>





<i>Introduction to Learn To Be</i>





<p>In an interview given to CNN in late 2011, Bill Gates stated that ""oneonone teaching is kind of that ideal that you would like to achieve where you see where they're [students are] confused, you see where they're [students are] bored and you're tuning what you say according to that."" </p>





<p>Since 2009, that ideal is exactly what the Learn To Be Foundation (LTB) has been offering to K12 students in Los Angeles and around the nation.  Through the use of a realtime virtual whiteboard with voice and webcam conferencing abilities, Learn To Be provides 100% free, online, oneonone academic support to underserved students struggling in math, science, and language arts. In this time, we have recruited over 600 volunteer tutors and have enabled them to teach over 20,000 sessions for over 11,000 hours of instruction to our students.  </p>





<p>Imagine a tutor from Iowa, sitting at a cafe on a portable device, helping a homeless student at a Los Angeles shelter learn his multiplication facts through the LTB online platform. Or a college student in her dorm in Austin helping a student at an elementary school in LA learn how to read.  This is what Learn To Be tutors have been doing since 2009.  Our tutors are likeminded individuals who are part of a crowdsourcing solution to todayâ€™s education problems.  Students no longer have one teacher but an army of them scattered across the nation, ready at a moments notice to help out in whatever way possible.  </p>





<p>But in an attempt to create an even more meaningful interaction between students and tutors we need to know what exactly students are struggling with, and as such we have proposed the following project: </p>





<p><i>An Adaptive and Persistent Problem Module (APPM)</i><br />





Adaptive systems are those in which the questions presented to students adapt based on whether the previous question was answered correctly or not.  So as students answer questions correctly, subsequent questions become increasingly difficult. </p>





<p>And by persistent, we mean that all problems logged by a student will be forever stored for recall.  This includes information regarding the correctness of the answer, all incorrect answers inputted before the correct answer was submitted, and how long it took the student to answer the problem correctly. </p>





<p>By themselves, adaptive and persistent programs already exist. However, none have been integrated so extensively into the constructs of a live, oneonone tutoring session. We want to implement our own APPM and integrate it into our online classroom.  </p>





<p>Not only does this practice help students to master academic material, but it also allows all tutors to have access to the same data for that student.  So, if for example, a tutor was working with a student on fractions during an online tutoring session, he could assign the student problems using the APPM and then subsequent tutors would know exactly how many problems were solved by that student in the previous session, how many were answered correctly, and how long it took them to answer these questions. This would instantly improve the quality of the session because the tutor need not rely on only the student to diagnose problem areas. </p>





<p>Ultimately, the goal is to close achievement gaps and this can be done when fundamental deficiencies in core subjects are addressed.  And once we address these deficiencies, attitudes towards learning improve and students are able to thrive in school, leading to higher scores and ultimately to higher graduation rates.  </p>

</ul>","<p><b>STANDARDIZED EXAM IMPROVEMENTS</b><br />





Learn To Be is currently working with its flagship program at Dorris Place Elementary, located in East Los Angeles. LTB tutors work with struggling 6th graders 3 times a week in core math concepts.  Prior to beginning, students had taken a statemandated periodic assessment exam and after 8 weeks of tutoring, they were given another periodic assessment.  In that time, no other additional academic service was provided other than Learn To Be and as a result, students saw an average increase of 22% on their exams. With the implementation of the APPM, we hope that further increases will be attained as tutors are able to better tailor their sessions to the direct needs of the students. </p>





<p><b>INTERNAL EVALUATION OF STUDENT DATA</b><br />





After completion of the APPM, Learn To Be will have a core set of problems solved for various students across multiple academic subjects.  This data can be analyzed both in the short term and the long term. </p>





<p>Immediate assessment postsession as tutors can recall stored data to confirm whether a student understood concepts or not based on number of questions answered correctly and time needed to complete each question. Learn To Be administrators can also evaluate how effective the tutor was in delivering content based on the problems solved by the student before, during and immediately after the session. </p>





<p>Long term internal assessments conducted by Learn to Be will measure both the accuracy AND speed with which students answer questions in different subject area over a period of time as data of all problems solved is stored on Learn To Be servers. For example, over a 6 month period, Learn To Be administrators can view progress on a students arithmetic knowledge or algebra knowledge. </p>





<p>With increased scores comes increased confidence and because Learn To Be focuses on fundamental concepts, students will be put on a more firm footing in school, enabling them to thrive as they grow older and coursework becomes more challenging. Attitudes towards learning will improve and ultimately, the hope is that graduation rates will as well. </p>


","	<p>To date, we have held partnerships with several schools in Los Angeles including Pio Pico Elementary, Sixth Avenue Elementary, the UCLA Community school and Dorris Place Elementary. Our flagship partnership is at Dorris Place Elementary.  Dorris Place has worked very closely with us to isolate students struggling the most and place them in an afterschool program. With our tutors working with their students, we have found major improvements not only in test scores, but in attitude as well. Dorris Place represents the model we hope to replicate in every school in the district that is home to underserved communities.  Outside of schools, we have also partnered with School On Wheels, whose mission is to enhance educational opportunities for homeless children in grades K12 in the Los Angeles area.  Our platform has enabled their volunteer tutors from around the nation to continue to tutor students who have been forced to move to new homeless shelters. </p>


	<p>All of our partners have benefitted from our services and will see those benefits increased many times from an enhanced focus on the individual needs of the student. This is what the APPM provides.  The individual experience will help teachers and administrators identify problem areas for students and fix them with Learn To Be tutors at their side. </p>


	<p>Ultimately, the true benefit for Los Angeles will come when all struggling students are provided the individualized attention they deserve and the APPM combined with Learn To Be tutoring can serve that function. </p>","	<p>Success in 2050 would manifest itself through the elimination of an achievement gap. No longer would underserved communities be held captive by their lack of academic resources. Students would be able to receive help as they need it and would be able to thrive to their greatest potential.  By 2050, technological advances will pave the way to a new style of learning for students. Things like adaptive learning will play an integral part in a studentâ€™s education. Students will have realtime data of their progress in all subjects and be able to track their progress throughout their entire academic career. </p>


<p>Because of the widespread availability of quality online resources, the excellence of education that a student receives will no longer be based on the neighborhood in which a student lives or how wealthy his family is. Struggling students will always have extra problems to complete and can work as many as it takes to fully understand the concept; similarly, gifted students will have greater opportunities to challenge themselves with enriched material. Peertopeer learning will become an established method of learning through the use of programs like LTB, which allow students to record themselves and teach their peers. It will be the ultimate crowdsourcing solution to education. Pairing people who want to learn with people who want to teach.</p>


<p> All of these methods will contribute to a more effective future â€œclassroomâ€ environment. And ultimately, Learn To Be hopes that dropout rates will plummet, graduation rates will rise, and the education divide between privileged communities and underserved communities will bridge. </p>"
3102155,2013155,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LEVITT.html,Igniting Imaginations Today Ensuring Arts Vitality Tomorrow,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>Levitt Pavilions envisions a LA 2050 in which the community as a wholeâ€”parents, children, young adults, seniorsâ€”comes together in welcoming outdoor settings to experience the joy of arts experiences open to all. We believe that access to high quality arts experiences shouldnâ€™t be reserved for those who can afford to buy ticketsâ€”but should be made available to everyone. We have already made tremendous strides to achieve our visionâ€”each summer over 100,000 Angelenos of all ages and backgrounds enjoy 100+ free concerts at Levitt Los Angeles in MacArthur Park (www.levittla.org) and Levitt Pasadena in Memorial Park (www.levittpavilionpasadena.org), adding vitality to public spaces that were once neglected and nurturing an appreciation for the arts in this great city we call home. </p>





<p>However, in the wake of drastic funding cuts to arts education in Los Angelesarea public schools, Levitt believes we could â€“ and must â€“ do more. Tens of thousands of youth are missing out on opportunities to engage more deeply with the artsâ€”compromising an invaluable part of their overall growth as individuals and members of society. Levitt Pavilions proposes to help fill this void by greatly enhancing Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadenaâ€™s popular free childrenâ€™s series. Through the introduction of a handson arts learning experience before each childrenâ€™s show, consisting of free, interactive workshops taught by highly skilled teaching artists in a welcoming and supportive environment, children will gain a deeper appreciation of that dayâ€™s performance inspiring their overall interest in the arts.</p>





<p>Both Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena have had amazing success with the childrenâ€™s series presented as part of the overall Levitt concert seasons, reaching 20,000 children every summer. The beauty of Levittâ€™s childrenâ€™s series is that it encourages active participation. Because each Levitt performance venue is located in a welcoming, outdoor setting featuring a grassy lawn, children run freely, dance and express themselves. Every Levitt concert is a reason to celebrate community and to appreciate the rich culture of music that thrives within greater Los Angeles. Our mission of â€œcommunity through musicâ€ is most often on display at Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadenaâ€™s childrenâ€™s concerts. Itâ€™s heartwarming to witness the sheer joy of children as they run up to the stage to be closer to Levitt artists. </p>





<p>The My LA 2050 grant will give Levitt Pavilions the opportunity to extend and deepen childrenâ€™s Levitt experiences through weekly preconcert workshops from late June through August 2013â€”on Wednesday nights in Pasadena and Sunday afternoons in MacArthur Park. These hourlong workshops will offer a fun and handson way for children to learn about music and opportunities for selfexpression.  Teaching artists will present interactive programs that are in sync with the program being presented on the stage that day.  We envision that the 20 childrenâ€™s concerts (10 concerts at each venue) will represent moments in a childâ€™s life when they begin to foster a sense of appreciation for music and experience the joy of creating and experiencing music in a communal setting. Through making an instrument, trying out cultural dances, creating murals, learning a new song and singing along with others, this supplemental interactive experience will add a rich new dimension to childrenâ€™s lives. Based upon the attendance at the childrenâ€™s programs in previous years, we anticipate that approximately 20,000 Los Angeles children will benefit from this program in 2013. </p>





<p>Our project best fits in the Arts and Cultural Vitality indicator, yet we also heavily impact the area of Social Connectedness and even Environmental Quality. Each Levitt venue is located in a city park, enlivening the communities the Levitt program serves by transforming neglected outdoor spaces into cherished destinations. We recognize that live music has always been a social connector, and that free, live music in welcoming, outdoor settings possesses the unique power to break social and economic barriers. By providing handson arts experiences for children and their families, Levitt will foster an appreciation for the arts and demonstrate the value of the arts as an integral component of vibrant cities. These experiences will inspire future generations to ensure the arts remain a vital part of Los Angeles. </p>","<p>Levitt Pavilions has developed an innovative program model, leveraging public/private partnerships in cities across the country to transform neglected public spaces into welcoming destinations through the power of free, live music. While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as catalysts for change in a community by reclaiming green spaces, activating underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often preclude access to the arts.</p>





<p>There are now six stateoftheart Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; & Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination.  Levittâ€™s open lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social connections.</p>





<p>But it wasnâ€™t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:


the nationâ€™s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crimeridden & abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>





<p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a dozen other cities across the country.</p>





<p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in 2003, reviving an abandoned, WPAera band shell in the once troubled Memorial Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, awardwinning artists, using the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet for families.</p>





<p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once crimeridden park into a welcoming destination.  The band shellâ€™s renovation served as the catalyst for the overall parkâ€™s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.â€™s most densely populated & underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.â€™s childrenâ€™s series gives thousands of underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>





<p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of success, & every year audiences increase.  In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt Pasadena were voted â€œBest Free Summer Concert Seriesâ€ by LA Weekly, & Levitt Pasadena was voted â€œBest Live Music Venueâ€ by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking distance of neighborhoods.</p>","<p>We will collaborate with the professional staff of Levitt Pavilion Los Angeles & Levitt Pavilion Pasadena (who program both venues), accomplished individuals with a proven track record of success in the presenting field & with a depth of experience in providing quality arts programming to the community.</p>


<p>Renee Bodie, Executive Director, 


Eddie Cota, Artistic Director,


Daniel RizikBaer, Marketing, & Outreach Coordinator, & 


Betty Avila, Community Relations Manager.</p>


<p>We will work with local teaching artists, selected with the assistance of the Education Department at the Music Center of LA County, to identify skilled educators with a specialty in teaching large groups of children through interactive activities.</p>","<p>We will evaluate the success of the childrenâ€™s series and preconcert arts workshops in the following key ways. First, we will measure the number of participants attending each of the 20 childrenâ€™s concerts and the number of children attending the preconcert workshops. Based upon past seasons of childrenâ€™s programming, we anticipate that over the course of the summer, this program will serve over 20,000 children and an additional 10,000 adults. </p>





<p>Next, following each childrenâ€™s workshop, Levitt professional staff and teaching artists will debrief and determine how to enhance participation, refine logistics and evaluate responses to specific outreach efforts. </p>





<p>Finally, to measure success in participation, we will collect qualitative data from a random sample of the participants.  The pavilions routinely collect audience surveys in both English and Spanish and this summerâ€™s surveys will include questions about the new interactive programming for children and families in order to receive immediate reactions to the project and measure its success. The surveys will be tallied and the results will be incorporated into a final report to be shared with the funder.</p>","We believe the arts are essential to creative thinking and participation in the arts plays an important role in the development of our children.  Thought leaders in education and government officials agree.





Todayâ€™s educators, politicians and business leaders spend a great deal of time and resources discussing the pressing need for a trained future workforce in the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in order for the country to remain competitive in tomorrowâ€™s economy. However, many astute leaders know that a letter is missing in this equation, the letter A (Art and Design), to spell STEAM. The arts are the lynchpin to success in building the workforce of 2050 simply because through the arts, students learn creative problem solving, effective communication, innovative thinking and the ability to navigate complex situations. They become better citizens and professionals across all fields and industries, as well as more thoughtful contributors to society, because they are able to more effectively express themselves and think creatively. As the former Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Rocco Landesman said at the Arts Education Partnership National Forum in April 2010, â€œThe arts provide us with new ways of thinking, new ways to draw connectionsâ€¦and they help maintain our competitive edge by engendering innovation and creativity.â€ United States Education Secretary Arne Duncan also added, â€œThe arts can no longer be treated as a frillâ€¦ arts education is essential to stimulating the creativity and innovation that will prove critical to young Americans competing in a global economy.â€ 





In the midst of arts funding cuts in public schools, the Levitt program offers a meaningful solution.  All Levitt programming is free of charge and family friendly. We create value across the board because our Los Angeles and Pasadena venues are accessible, conveniently located near public transit, and available to all who wish to participate. By offering firsthand involvement in the arts, Levittâ€™s program will help build the Los Angeles leaders of tomorrow by providing rich arts learning experiences, and in turn helping to build a better Los Angeles for the next generation.





While the Levitt program is nationwide, two of our six pavilions are located in Los Angeles County â€“ Pasadena (Memorial Park) and Los Angeles (MacArthur Park). A total of 100+ concerts are presented from midJune to the end of August each year in the greater Los Angeles area â€“ free of charge. The wildly popular childrenâ€™s programs reach tens of thousands each season, and many families attend these concerts on a regular and often weekly basis. By adding an educational and interactive component to the childrenâ€™s programming, we will have the ability to engage more youth in Levittâ€™s work and have them leave the concerts with not only a memory of the interactive activities and concert but also possess an increased appreciation for the arts.","For us, success in 2050 would be a Los Angeles with adults (the children of today) and their children participating in, attending, and creating art as an integral part of their everyday lives.  Our hope is that through our efforts today, the next generation will appreciate the value of public spaces activated through shared arts experiences.  The seeds planted today will be seen in future investments in the arts and the arts will be accessible to all, creating a more cohesive society. In 2050, all Angelenos will have ample opportunities to participate in high quality performing arts experiences. The citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be inspired by and appreciate how music and arts participation makes us all better people; more tolerant, innovative and engaged. This appreciation and understanding will translate into the arts playing a prominent role in our cityâ€™s vitality."

For nearly 40 years Liberty Hill has been bringing communities together across race, class, gender, sexuality and geography, but weâ€™ve been doing this on a relatively small scale. Now, we see a huge opportunity to advance communitybuilding to a new scale by the Impact Professionals who will build the L.A. of 2050. 





When Liberty Hill has brought these Impact Professionals together whether they are nonprofit staff, techsavvy social entrepreneurs, community organizers, elected officials, or Angelenos who simply want to â€œdo good,â€ they have asked us for more, more! Liberty Hillâ€™s L.A. Boot Camp 2050 for Change is our answer.  





We propose to host a series of popup events in the next seven months in partnership with dozens of our grantees whose roots in L.A.â€™s low income and minority communities run deep in order to recruit and galvanize a new generation of idealists.  





These popup events will be inspired and fun gathering places for people to begin to learn â€œthe scienceâ€ of social change. Most people  no matter how much good they want to do  donâ€™t know the lessons of community organizing or how to strategically advance change in their communities, let alone across Los Angeles. 





For the last several years Liberty Hill has had a training program specifically designed to help individuals strengthen their skills in making change. We will recruit this Next Generation of Idealists into a Boot Camp 2050 for Change â€“a handson, practical training. Itâ€™s part â€œTEDx for Social Justice,â€ part rollupyoursleeves, nuts and bolts, â€œhereâ€™s how you make changeâ€ training. 


","Liberty Hill invests in community groups on the frontlines of change with critical resources that are needed to advance their work and win.  We supplement those financial resources with a highly impactful training program designed to advance grassroots campaigns for social change. 





Over the last 10 years, this is what Liberty Hill has helped our grantees deliver for Los Angeles:





â€¢  Nearly 100,000 lowincome men and women registered to vote


â€¢  Legal safeguards to protect California's 25,000 LGBTQ high school students from harassment and violence


â€¢  25,000 men and women raised above the poverty level by living wage jobs


â€¢  $400 million secured for parks in lowincome neighborhoods


â€¢  400,000 L.A. bus riders ride the largest cleanfuel bus fleet in the country


â€¢  $1.74 million in back wages for men and women working at poverty wages in Koreatown supermarkets


â€¢  300,000 bottlefed babies safe from the toxic chemical BPA


â€¢  30,000 L.A. transgender persons with improved access to medical care


",We will partner with Liberty Hill grantees and their allies in order to plan and host events that represent the diversity of the Liberty Hill community and inspire Impact Professionals and other Next Generation idealists to meet each other and begin to collaborate on campaigns for change. ,"Initial outcomes will be measured by tracking the number of people who participate at the events, the number of people who participate in the Boot Camp 2050 for Change, and the scale of the social media reach generated by this unprecedented partnership of community organizations and Impact Professionals.","L.A. needs a social force to bring the next generation of idealists into conversation and action. This proposal will bring together Impact Professionals and grassroots leaders representing a cross section of race, class, gender, sexuality and geography to overcome socially constructed boundaries which we recognize are imaginary and changeable.





By bringing together, L.A.â€™s next generation of idealists, Liberty Hill will catalyze a new and impactful force for change in many neighborhoods and on multiple issues. Since these efforts and campaigns will be driven by this generation, we can channel our regionâ€™s available potential â€“its people who are yearning to connectâ€“ to reshape L.A. into a vigorous, thriving and pleasing place to live by 2050.





Our 40year track record tells us that by building on longtime relationships of trust and supporting those relationships with highimpact training, the benefits to L.A.â€™s political and social life are potentially enormous.   


","Success in 2050 will be measurable in several incremental improvements in the quality of life in Los Angeles.   By laying the groundwork in Social Connectedness now, some examples of success might be evidenced by:





â€¢	Advancing EDUCATION reform that will reward success and not punish youth


â€¢	Expansion of green spaces and clean air quality, two fundamental ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY improvements which will reduce environmentallyrelated cases of asthma and cancer


â€¢	Improving access to HEALTH care services and wellbeing opportunities


â€¢	Amplifying the voices of marginal communities in the ARTS and strengthening CULTURAL VITALITY by making LA the venue of choice for creative thinkers and innovators


â€¢	Lifting the most vulnerable lowwage workers our of poverty through increased INCOME & EMPLOYMENT opportunities


â€¢	Safeguarding affordable HOUSING stock


â€¢	Increasing PUBLIC SAFETY through community centered policing and common sense neighborhood restoration

3102157,2013157,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/liftcommunities.html,LIFTing up Constituent Voice to positively impact poverty perception practice and policy , Social Connectedness,"LIFT believes that all people, regardless of socioeconomic status, need the following threedimensional supports to overcome povertyâ€™s cycle of crisis and move ahead in life: economic resources (money in our pocket); internal capabilities (selfconfidence, problem solving skills ); strong community networks (people in our corner). When clients come to LIFTLA for support (to secure housing, food security, employment, educational opportunities) they are immediately connected with a trained volunteer advocate who partners with them to navigate through the complex social service delivery systems and map to economic security.  LIFTLAâ€™s premise is that 1) we all have shaky ground moments, regardless of income, and deserve the same types of support in times of crisisâ€” dignified and caring support; 2) constituent voice is needed to devise systems and allocate funds that will effectively move people out of the cycle of poverty; and 3) an empathetic response unleashes potential for both individual and institutional change. To turn up the volume on constituent voice to debunk the myths of poverty  and erect more sound policy, our big idea is to bring the constituent voice to the forefront of informing and reforming the way we address poverty in LA.





Myth:  Poor people do not have a voice. Author and activist, Arundhati Roy states that ""there is no such thing as the voiceless. There are the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard."" There is much that nonprofits can learn from the for profit sector about the benefits of acting on customer feedback. Companies, who are more responsive see profit margins 3040% higher than those who do not take satisfaction into account. These gains are transferable to the human service delivery. The Gates Foundation, for instance, has found that the best way to test teacher effectiveness is, well, to ask the students. Furthermore, there is direct correlation with academic performance. Applied to our social service delivery system, it makes sense that if clients are able to rate their experience, it would inform and drive more efficient and effective programs that will better the outcomes for clients and communities. LIFTLA will develop an interface (like a Yelp App) to scale constituent voice that the county can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and expenditures, and that funders can use to guide their philanthropy. Social service delivery programs will be incentivized to properly serve their customer!





Myth: Only poor people face life challenges. The reality is that life is complicated for everyone no matter what race, gender, income level, zip code. So much time is spent trying to keep the pieces togetherwith child care, lawyers, accountants, personal assistants, family and friends in order to keep up the appearance having it together. LIFTLAâ€™s Shaky Ground Moment campaign invites celebrities and high profile public figures (those who are at the forefront of keeping up appearances) to speak up about their shaky ground moments in order to uncover a shared understanding about what we all need in order to get by in crisisâ€”moral and material support  from our networks. By elevating their voice in a way that we are not accustomed to, we strip down the sense that needing to reach out for support is a condition of poverty, while heightening the realization that a holistic and humanitarian response is as vital as material resources in times of need.  





Myth: Poor people are weak and lazy and systems are there to help.  In reality, poverty is complicated and getting help should not be, but lowincome individuals often find themselves lacking the knowledge of overcomplicated matrix of community resources to find solid footing. In order to challenge assumptions and change perception, LIFT has developed a simulation called LIFTopolis, a city where social service providers are understaffed, underfunded, and overburdened by unmanageable caseloads, much like what occurs in real life. The participants in this exerciseâ€”policymakers, philanthropists, social services professionals, etcâ€”assume the identity, circumstances, budget, and goals of a real LIFT client navigating a room of service providers and trying to achieve their objectives (e.g. housing for the family, stable income, nutritional assistance for their children, etc). Through the experience participants gain a greater understanding of what lowincome families need from a system, and they collectively build new solutions that can be taken to market and tested.





Government did not design the social service system from a humancentered perspective, and thus is unable to address complicated and interconnected problems, or foster trusting relationships between service providers and the families that most need help.  The Shaky Ground Campaign, LIFT Yelp App, and the LIFTopolis simulation will bring the client voice and experience at the core of guiding practice and policy change.


","<p>LIFT is a national organization that was founded over fourteen years ago.  Since its founding, LIFT has helped over 70,000 low income community members work side by side with volunteer advocates to help them achieve their goals. Today, LIFT operates 11 resource centers in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.. Over the last decade, LIFT has established a track record of success in supporting families on their path to economic security.  In Fiscal Year 2012, 730 advocates helped 11,000 individuals and families move forward on path to economic selfsufficiency. At a time when the economic climate makes the job market hard to enter, affordable housing hard to find, and resources hard to secure, LIFT is telling a different story for its clients. Last year, LIFT generated $13.7 million in wage increases, tax refunds, public benefits, and housing assistance for its clients, providing $1,245 in value for the average client.</p>


 


<p>As David Bornstein wrote in the New York Times (January 2012), â€œIf the American Dream is to be resuscitated for many of nationâ€™s poor, there is a great deal that we can learn from LIFT.â€  LIFTâ€™s  socially innovative model has received national and local attention


In the NYTimes, Huffington Post, and other publications.

<p>In the 8 weeks that we have been open, we have served 90 clients, and word of mouth has already kicked in with community members hearing about us from their neighbors, in churches, and at community gatherings.</p>


 


<p>We have already reached our capacity for advocates with volunteers coming from USC, UC Irvine, Azusa Pacific University, University of Phoenix, and Loyola Law School.  Several other colleges and universities are seeking to partner with us when we have space to include additional volunteers.</p>","*The Magnolia Community Initiative (MCI) which unites 80+ community organizations in an effort to create sustainable and scalable community improvement;


*Propper Daley, a social impact agency that works with passionate individuals who have the personal, financial and/or social capital to champion meaningful causes and ideas;


*David Bonbright of Keystone Accountability, an expert in gathering and analyzing constituent voice in order to improve performance and foster a culture of mutual accountability; 


*Technology and social media execs in Google, Facebook, Activision, and NALA Investments to capture the constituent voice feedback loop; 


*The County Board of Supervisors Office to participate in LIFTopolis and share evaluation findings.    ","LIFT is engaging Keystone Accountability, a London based evaluation firm which helps nonprofits and foundations develop better ways of measuring and reporting social change, to develop and test its constituent voice system. Constituent voice is a groundbreaking program management tool that provides nonprofits with a way to measure performance against their intended results while fostering relationships of trust between staff/volunteers and their program participants. Nonprofit organizations working for social change lack a unifying performance management principle to ensure they are making progress towards their mission. Constituent Voice makes the perspectives of the people who are meant to enjoy the benefits of the social serviceâ€“ the primary constituents â€“ visible to decision makers at the organization. The voices of participants should be central to performance measurement and decisionmaking. Constituent voice provides a constant stream of feedback data that organizations use to be accountable to the experiences of their constituents and improve performance. By combining feedback data with other evidence of results (e.g. job and housing placements, increased savings), constituent voice helps nonprofits discover which feedback is most predictive of participant and overall program success. The process includes: 





1) Collect Feedback: Ask constituents a rotating series of 2 to 5 questions after every meeting through a


confidential survey.


2) Analyze Data: Interpret feedback alongside other data sets (e.g. economic outcomes, 3rd party evaluations, observations).


3) Refine Program: Review program effectiveness and assess staff/volunteer performance against feedback data. Develop plans for improvement and highlight areas of success.


4) Report Back to Constituents: Validate feedback and dialogue with respondents about the plan for improvement.


5) Share with the Public: Report feedback results and program adjustments to clients, donors, partners, and the general public.





LIFTLA will utilize the data gathered through constituent voice to inform program design and improve overall performance. The feedback that clients provide through ongoing surveys will directly affect decisionmaking at all levels of the organization â€“ from our top executives to program staff to volunteers. By comparing this work with economic outcome data, LIFTLA will make adjustments that respond directly to the needs of our clients. We are committed to continually refining our program to ensure it provides the highest possible value to our clients.  





LIFTLA's proven humanitarian approach should receive attention from influencers in policy to rate their own programs, discover gaps, and consider adopting similar carebased strategies to their own service delivery systems.We will leverage our results to impact broader perception, policy, and practice in the social service sector  establishing LIFT as a leader in the conversation around effective approaches to fighting poverty.


","In some LA neighborhoods, 2 in 3 people are living in or close to poverty! The problem is more than income, it is about the systems that fail to help families get a toehold, and ultimately, discourage them from achieving their goals. Services are often fragmented, bureaucratic, and are built on the stereotypes that uphold the belief that those with less resource are to blame for their circumstance. In contrast, what we find every day in LIFT offices is great resilience, resourcefulness, and endurance that exists in the face of tremendous challenges and stigmas of poverty. LIFTLA knows that systems built on false premise of who poor people are and what poor people need perpetuate the cycle of poverty (50% of those who move out of poverty will fall back into poverty in a yearâ€™s time). It is due to this builtin shortsightedness that billions are spent annually in the fight against poverty without moving the needle significantly over the decade. This is an economic issue for all Angelenos, but also one of social connectedness. A critical piece of the puzzle is still missing: relationships and understanding, aka social capital. We have all faced moments of crisis in our lives when we relied on the guidance and emotional support of friends and family to help us overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. Likewise, community members struggling with poverty need more than financial assistance; they need help accessing services; they need social connections and emotional supports; they need an empowered voice. 





LIFTLAâ€™s model features volunteerism, empathy, and resource connections that are clientcentered attending to both immediate needs and long term aspirations. On average, LIFT helps clients secure 2.5 major outcomes â€“ employment, housing, healthcare  per family. LIFTâ€™s model has been vetted by the Robin Hood Foundation to have a ROI of 3:1. LIFTâ€™s approach demonstrates how a humanoriented safety net system might work for LA.





The Shaky Ground Campaign combined with LIFTopolis helps to shift the perception of poverty to create the stage for client centered evaluation. Channels for developing empathy are created through our constituent voice strategies. The LIFT app will allow for clients to speak up about how well (or not) they have been helped by a given provider. Constituent Voice is at the forefront of innovation in the public sector; the world largest charity rater, Charity Navigator, recently added constituent voice to its new set of rating criteria. This rating informing philanthropy provides huge incentive for optimal service delivery which would in turn create a more economically just LA. This voice, when heeded, has the power to change policy to more effectively allocate tax and philanthropic dollars to create economic opportunities for individuals and transform communities. Empathy + Consumer driven evaluative measurement = Empowered change!


","LIFTLAâ€™s deployment of these strategies will provide a cuttingedge model for other nonprofits and government agencies to improve performance and adapt their programs to better meet constituent needs. In doing so, we will fundamentally change how we design and deploy social service programs throughout the county.   Through the Shaky Ground Campaign and LIFTopolis, by 2050, there will be a changed perception of people who are poor an important step that needs to be made in order to bring about effective policy. Because of being able to make connections to personal shaky ground moments, people will begin to break down the walls of ""other"" and start to think of what we all need when reaching out for help.  And then recognize, through LIFTopolis, that it is neither fair nor just that proper dignified treatment is not in place for people when most vulnerable. Constituent voice will provide the data for organizations to improve programs and the subsequent results needed to lead the conversation about effective solutions to the persistent problem of poverty. Client feedback will demonstrate how a welcoming office environment, trusting relationships, and exceptional customer service support client progress on the path to economic stability.  Constituent voice will prove that the â€œsoft skillsâ€ that clients develop during their engagement with LIFT (selfconfidence, problem solving) are not soft at all; they are what drives longterm change in clientsâ€™ lives.  





By incorporating constituent voice as the anchor of our evaluation strategy, by 2050, we will prove LIFTâ€™s core hypothesis: If clients receive support across all three dimensions of wellbeing  economic, internal, and community  they will accelerate their economic gains and sustain them over time.  Funding, and tax dollars would be well spent in actually helping someone to move to a place of well being and stability, not just barely getting by. Together, we will raise the bar for the entire social service system â€“ helping lowincome families across the county achieve their dreams. Social service delivery programs will finally live up to its name, delivering individuals out of the cycle of poverty through social connectedness.

3102158,2013158,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Waste.html,Green Jobs in a Zero Waste LA, Income & Employment,"<p>The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy proposes to partner with Isidore Electronics Recycling in a project that has the potential to generate tens of thousands of good green jobs in the City of Los Angeles by 2050 and improve the quality of thousands of existing jobs, all while contributing to a cleaner environment. </p>





<p>LAANEâ€™s Donâ€™t Waste LA project has taken the first step in this initiative by winning City Council endorsement of an exclusive franchise system for collection and diversion of waste from customers not served by the City.  Currently the city of LA picks up trash at single family and small multifamily homes while private haulers receive city permits to collect waste from all other users based on service agreements with building owners and businesses.  </p>





<p>Commercial trash accounts for over 70 percent of the city's waste but neither the city nor the private haulers are subject to any landfill diversion requirements. Private haulers are not required to recycle and the companies are not regulated. Due to this lack of regulation, recycling facilities often create major health and safety concerns for workers and nearby residents.</p>





<p>Most materials are collected together and then sorted by hand, sent off to the Central Valley or overseas for reuse, and not necessarily reused in the most sustainable way.  Most of LAâ€™s ewaste is shipped out of the county or the state for processing.  </p>





<p>The policy that LAANE proposed and the Council endorsed will establish designated service zones with haulers competing for the exclusive right to service each of those areas. Successful bidders would have to adhere to strict environmental, recycling and labor standards. Recycling will be mandatory and increase exponentially, and the companies engaged in recycling will be held to new high standards. 


The Donâ€™t Waste LA project aims to make LA a national model for resource management by creating a system that allows us to reach zero waste goals, while insuring that both the new jobs created as a result of recycling, and existing jobs in the industry, are good ones.  </p>





<p>We are currently working with the City to prepare the regulations and standards for the new system.   We aim for the new system and accompanying environmental review to be finalized and approved by the Council in the next year, followed by the request for proposals process and award of franchise agreements, which begins the transition to the new system.  All the new contracts will not be in place and operating until 2017, but the system will begin to be implemented in 2014 as the RFP process starts and contracts are awarded.</p>





<p>Full implementation of the franchise and stopping the export of recycling will result in the creation of at least 14,400 new living wage jobs in processing.  The franchise policy will ensure a steady stream of recyclables enabling companies like our partner Isidore Recycling to expand their business, and can lay the groundwork and provide incentives for remanufacturing locally.   In addition, incentives could be built into the policy to benefit companies like Isidore.  For example, in addition to educating their customers about ewaste, franchisees could be required to choose responsible subcontractors located in LA. 


With Isidore Recycling, we are proposing to pilot a model for how social entrepreneurs can take advantage of this new policy to expand their businesses and create good new jobs. Our proposal includes: 1) full implementation of the franchise to reach citywide zero waste, improve existing impacted jobs, create 14,400 good new processing jobs, and lay the groundwork for the creation of quality jobs in recycling and remanufacturing:  2) ensuring the franchise policy includes a goal and plan for recycling ewaste (the fastest growing waste stream in the city) in the implementation of the policy in each service zone; 3) a specific marketing plan to educate people and businesses about recycling their ewaste, and to increase ewaste recycling from 20% to 100% by 2050; 4) research on the current landscape of recycling and remanufacture in order to determine which incentives, both through this policy and otherwise, can help seed the expansion of local remanufacturing.


Development of the market for recycling and remanufacture in the City will require marketbased incentives and a focus on capital investments in order to bolster the infrastructure.  It will also benefit from government procurement policies that are more stringent and prioritize higher percentages of recycled content, as well as a database of processors, manufacturers, and material brokers.  We will need to do a study on material recovery facilitiesâ€™ processing standards and the recovery rates for each material that enters a facility. The next step in the ewaste recycling industry in LA is better recovery of minerals, metals and plastics for remanufactureâ€”another source of new green jobs.</p>","<p>LAANE was formed in 1993 to improve the quality of life and the environment in lowincome communities in LA.  Using research, organizing, coalitionbuilding, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to cleaning up the environment in lowincome communities.</p>


<p>LAANE helped to launch the Community Benefits movement in 2001 and built coalitions that won Community Benefits Agreements for major economic developments, guaranteeing a wide range of environmental, economic and other benefits for communities. Our groundbreaking work on the CBA for LAX Airport allocated $500 million to environmental studies and mitigations that have reduced noise and air pollution generated by the Airport.</p>


<p>LAANEâ€™s work on trucking at the Ports of LA and Long Beach established a â€œconcessionâ€ program that has resulted in scrapping 16,000 polluting trucks and replacing them with trucks meeting the highest standards for low emissionsâ€”reducing truckcaused pollution by 80% to date.</p>


<p>We have won approval of policies to uplift job quality and improve job access and training in construction, including developments at the Port of LA, work under the Department of Public Works, and, most recently, major transit projects planned by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. These Construction Careers Policies have already yielded training and employment for thousands of disadvantaged workers and will ultimately reach close to 90,000.  One of our newest projects provides for training disadvantaged LA workers to carry out energy efficiency measures in buildings all over the City in partnership with the Department of Water and Power.</p>


<p>Much of our work has been about job qualityâ€”beginning with our victory in the 1997 landmark LA Living Wage Ordinance.  Since then, we have won other living wage policies and upgraded the original policy several times.</p>


<p>We have produced the highest quality research reports on the industries that we have targeted and on poverty and jobs.  We developed a communications program that rivals those of many much larger nonprofit organizations.</p>


<p>Isidore Electronics Recycling is in its second year collecting ewaste and training and employing the previously incarcerated. A staff of 6 operates out of a warehouse in northeast LA. Trainees learn to demanufacture ewaste, repair and refurbish electronics for reuse, staff collection events and operate the ecommerce store. Isidore has collected and/or processed over 110,000 pounds of electronics and earned revenue through escrap sales and its Ebay store. Clients include American Apparel, Pitches County Detention Center, LA Car Guy, and Helms Bakery Properties. All employees make at least $10/hour with opportunities for advancement.</p>","LAANE comes to this project with key partners in place, including Isidore Recycling, which will provide the model for a responsible LAbased industry. We have also partnered with the City Bureau of Sanitation and key political officials including a Councilmember and State assembly member.  Moreover, the Donâ€™t Waste LA coalition has some 40 members including labor, environmental and environmental justice organizations, communitybased organizations and groups, neighborhood councils, students, and small businessesâ€”including some high road waste haulers.  We hope to add more responsible entrepreneurs to the team as the project develops, most notably the businesses that locate recycling and remanufacturing facilities in the City.","Success will mean that 1) a massive waste diversion program is adopted and implemented in a way that yields a minimal 75% diversion rate by 2017, and a 90% diversion rate by 2025, 2) the program is innovative and serves as a model for other regions, and 3) tens of thousands of disadvantaged workers are trained and employed in the revamped recycling industry and the new local remanufacturing industry.  In addition, existing jobs in the industriesâ€”from collection to remanufactureâ€”will be upgraded to familysupporting standards.


Our criteria for success over the next fiveyear period are:


1) All of our criteria, including standards for recycling facilities and management of ewaste, are included in the final ordinance enabling the exclusive franchise policy, the implementation plan, and the subsequently issued RFPs.


2) The ordinance is approved by the City Council by early 2014 at the latest and transition to the new system is put into motion in 2014. 


3)  A major initiative to attract recycling and remanufacturing businesses to LA will be successful, leading to at least five recycling and at least three remanufacturing businesses that locate or remain in the city and meet high standards.  


4)  The ewaste pilot project will spur more responsible entrepreneurs in this field to start up in LA, resulting in virtually all ewaste being recycled and remanufactured locally.


5)  By 2025, the City achieves 90% recycling of ewaste.  


LAANE staff has established the baseline data on existing conditions in the waste collection industry, including cleanliness of trucks, job quality, and impact on neighborhoods as well as numbers of recycling facilities and their practices, and the lack of local remanufacturing facilities.  Progress following implementation of the exclusive franchise system will be measured against these baselines.  The tools we will use to document impact will include citygenerated reports, interviews with residents, business owners, and industry workers, and direct observation of the collection system and the recycling and remanufacturing facilities in operation.","<p>The exclusive franchise that meets our zero waste goals (all waste recycled, composted or otherwise processed) will create over 2,800 new jobs even while 80% of recycling is exported. With robust new infrastructure for recycling and remanufacturing that ends export of recycables, an additional 11,500 jobs can be added, building to nearly 50,000 jobs in these industries in LA by 2050. </p>





<p>While this project can be a huge generator of jobs, if the region does not develop new recycling infrastructure, recycling/remanufacturing will continue to be exported overseas. Absent this change, within the next decade, an estimated 11,500 new manufacturing jobs will be lostâ€” and we estimate that every job sent overseas could mean seven jobs in our region.  For example, upon implementation of the exclusive franchise, if plastics and compost infrastructure is developed, it will immediately create 6,000 jobs that would otherwise go out of the country.</p>


LAANE, Isidore and our other partners in this work will ensure that the jobs created in waste hauling, diversion and remanufacture pay family supporting wages, offer health care and are safe and green.</p>





<p>Ewaste is one of the most promising areas for job creation in recycling.  Now, over 200,000 tons of ewaste end up in landfills annually, though it is toxic and illegal. The benefits of the proper stewardship of ewaste are considerable. Electronics can be demanufactured for valuable materials such as titanium and platinum. Handled correctly, these increasingly rare commodities, along with other materials, can be remanufactured to benefit LA workers, industry and the community. </p>





<p>LA will benefit from incubating manufacturing businesses that make new products out of highvolume recycled materials like compostable organics and plastics as the demand for highquality compost from farmers and recycled plastic goods for remanufacture increases. The demand from residents and businesses that prefer products made of recycled materials will boost the economy. </p>





<p>At the core of the issue is making sure we have highquality materials for businesses that need them the most: processors and remanufacturers. By keeping a ""closedloop"" on recycling, we ensure that we have more materials in the recycling stream, we can attract and incubate entire recycling supply chains, and we are able to create more jobs. Part of our research will include exploring promising new policy strategies including government procurement policies and tax incentives as a means of encouraging the expansion of this industry â€“ one that already has created 128,000 jobs in California.</p>





<p>The implementation of the exclusive franchise will not only lead to new job creation and the uplift of existing jobs, the project will include significant environmental benefits leading to a zero waste city, cleaner air due to newly required cleanfuel trucks, and streets that are safer and relieved of nuisance.</p>","<p>In 2050, Los Angeles will be a zero waste city.  All waste will be recycled or diverted.  There will be no landfills or incineration and the streets will be cleaner.</p>





<p>We envision a new ecosystem for LA where waste and recycling jobs are part of the new green economy; where we reimagine what we view as â€œtrash,â€ and see it as a potential resource, and where we encounter less waste overall and virtually no plastic or other nondegradable trash.  Households and businesses will recycle and compost, there will be no incineration and no landfills.  All trash will be recycled by local businesses and made into useful products by local residents paid living wages and provided benefits and clean, safe working conditions.  This new system will represent the transformation of a dirty, unsustainable industry into a just and green one that provides tens of thousands of good new jobs in LA. </p>





<p>In 2050, 100% of ewaste will be diverted from landfills and properly recycled. It will be collected and processed within the region, and the materials recovered (metals, plastic, circuit boards and glass) used in local remanufacturing industries. The regional ewaste recycling industry will have grown in publicprivate partnership between social enterprises, local government and public agencies so that 1) the public is informed and empowered to properly dispose of their ewaste, 2) government and local ewaste companies have the capacity to collect and process the city's ewaste, and 3) local social enterprises will utilize the entire waste stream to train and hire workers in Los Angeles for quality career ladder jobs. </p>





<p>There will be fewer trucks collecting waste and they will be clean vehicles.  Their routes will not overlap and they will not be a nuisance in neighborhoods.  Rates will be fair and affordable.</p>





<p>Employment in the waste collection, recycling and remanufacturing industries will be high quality with familysupporting wages and full benefits.</p>





<p>There will be at least 50,000 new or improved jobs in the LA recycling and remanufacturing industries and these will be high quality jobs with career ladders.</p>





<p>The ewaste pilot project will spur more responsible entrepreneurs in this field to start up in LA resulting in all ewaste being recycled and remanufactured.</p>





<p>All recycled materials will be reused in the most sustainable way.</p>





<p>All of LAâ€™s recycling and remanufacturing will be done by businesses located in the City that will employ residents.</p>"
3102159,2013159,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Streets2Gardens.html,Youth Take Their Lives Off The Streets And Into Gardens, Environmental Quality,"     Todayâ€™s youth will bring tomorrowâ€™s environmental change.  Los Angeles Communities Advocating for Unity, Social Justice and Action, Inc (LA CAUSA) believes that our youth possess the power to bring systemic change to their environments.  Our youth go from the Streets2Gardens.  The Streets2Gardens program will be a stepping stone to establishing a communityâ€™s ability to become selfsustainable by growing its own food, as well as addressing the issue of the quality of air, through the engagement of disenfranchised youth at elementary schools.  


     The goals of the Streets2Gardens program are twofold:  (1) create a curriculum that is engaging to youth and small children in order to encourage participation in growing gardens and trees to improve the environment of impoverished areas; and (2) get different communities in LA County to support green initiatives to improve their environment though planting gardens and trees.  


     When there is a curriculum that is engaging and relevant to the community, the possibilities are endless.  LA CAUSA's youth will create an engaging curriculum for elementary school children in schools the most affected by environmental neglect. LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will also conduct research and determine which elementary schools they wish to approach.  The goal is to select two elementary schools in cities, such as Huntington Park, Highland Park, Rosemead and even as far as Pomona.  These schools will be in addition to two elementary schools which LA CAUSA has already been working with in Los Angeles:  Humphreys Avenue Elementary and Eastman Avenue Elementary School.


     Once they have selected the schools, then the real fun begins.  Alongside the elementary school children, our youth will plant gardens with an array of native Southern California plants, including fruits, vegetables and trees.  As part of the program, our youth, with the assistance of experienced staff, will also educate the elementary school children and the surrounding community about the environmental benefits of growing their own food and planting trees.  They will treat the soil, plant the seeds and trees, harvest the crop, and educate the elementary school children on how they can do the same at home and help the environment, as well as have healthier food options.  The youth will also give workshops to the community about the importance of youth getting involved in environmental issues and share their work at the elementary school gardens.


     There is power in numbers.  There would be about 10 youth involved in this program, broken up into two teams of five and assigned to one of the existing gardens and one of the new gardens.  In addition, our youth will host a minimum of two community workshops, bringing different sections of the County together.  


LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will use their creativity to produce marketing materials, such as brochures and a video of their work, to promote the program and the positive impact of youth involved in environmental issues.  The written materials will inform the community of the work being done, why it is being done and who is performing the work, with special thanks to the funder that made it all possible.  The video will track the curriculum created and show how any school and family can take their limited resources to grow a garden that can produce healthy food options, as well as address environmental concerns about air quality.    


      Through the Streets2Gardens program, LA CAUSAâ€™s youth will learn necessary life skills that will be transferrable to postsecondary education and employment opportunities.  They will be taught to be accountable to their peers and the community by being timely, perform, and work as a team.  Therefore, they will receive compensation in the form of stipends to model after a reallife employment situation.  If they do not meet the requirements of the program, then their pay will suffer.  These necessary life skills will give our youth the ability to establish positive habits that will enhance their level of success in postsecondary education and employment.  In educating the elementary school children and the community about the program, our youth will incorporate how life responsibilities affect the outcome of your efforts.  For instance, if the garden keepers lack responsibility and fail to timely care for plants and trees, the environment suffers.       


     LA CAUSA believes that through these gardens, some of the most impoverished areas of Los Angeles can become selfsustainable and be better equipped to control their environment.  Through the involvement of the program's youth, LA CAUSA seeks to show that when you give youth a sense of purpose, they can be catalysts for change no matter where they come from or what their past looks like.  The youth will give back to the community and engage in environmental activism to improve the same area that is currently being destroyed by poverty and environmental neglect.


","     LA CAUSA has successfully begun to grow gardens at Humphreys Elementary and Eastman Elementary.  These gardens have served to host mentor/mentee events and has engaged a number of community youth and elementary school children.  Through the California Endowment, LA CAUSA has also helped corner stores in Boyle Heights change their appearance and products to offer healthier foods, including more fruits and vegetables.  The corner stores receiving this attention are those surrounding poorperforming elementary schools in Boyle Heights.  Recently, San Gabriel Conservation Core and LA CAUSA have been discussing a partnership to grow a community farm that would feed families in need of healthier food options.","     LA CAUSA has been fortunate to have a great ally in San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corp., which has express a interest in creating a partnership to address environmental issues, in particular, the need for the community to become selfsustainable through the cultivation of gardens and farms.  In addition, Humphreys Elementary, Eastman Elementary are current partners in LA CAUSA's efforts and we look forward to contacting two additional elementary schools to expand the work LA CAUSA has begun.  LA CAUSA will also actively continue looking for opportunities to create partnerships and collaboration with other organizations to further LA CAUSA's garden ideas.  ","     As part of the curriculum, pre and post assessments can be given to the elementary school children, as well as the community members who attend the workshops.  These assessments will reflect how much they knew about the benefits of gardens on the environment before working with LA CAUSA and compare it to the knowledge base after attending an educational session or workshop with LA CAUSA.  It will also measure the likelihood of those engaged in the program to remain involved in the future.  We will create a database to track the age of the participants, knowledge before the program and after, and their likelihood to remain involved in some way with improving their environment.  The goal is to have at least 80% of the participants give the program a successful rating.  ","     Streets2Gardens program will benefit Los Angeles by bridging the gap between different communities on the issue of environmental neglect.  The Streets2Gardens program will create and promote a garden curriculum that can be replicated in any school and individual home.  The program will also show how youth have a tremendous amount of power in changing the circumstances of their communities.  By putting soil, seeds and trees in the hands of our youth, and connecting them with their community in a positive way, they will become catalysts for systemic change in their environments.  Streets2Gardens will begin by getting 10 youth off the streets and into gardens, creating and teaching a garden curriculum that will be engaging and powerful.  Streets2Gardens will get result in different sections of Los Angeles County coming together to discuss how their environment affects them and how the gardens will begin to address a number of health and environmental issues.  


     The two existing gardens and the two new gardens, plus trees to be planted at all four sites, will begin a trend that will result in improved health and air quality in the area.  The gardens will harvest fruits and vegetables that can be eaten by the children at the school and/or their parents.  With the curriculum that is going to be created and shared with the participating schools, the schools can encourage and teach the parents to plant their own fruit and vegetable gardens.  The possibilities are endless.  


","     LA CAUSA envisions Los Angeles to be full of gardens at all schools and homes.  The schools and homes would provide healthy food options to the community, thus realizing true selfsustainability.  It follows that the air quality would have improved given the increased presence of plants and trees in the communities.  Los Angeles would look green with rich reds, oranges, and yellows, to name a few colors, with crisp wind blowing.   





The youth who made this possible are likely to be involved in address environmental issues as public servants, lawyers practicing environmental law, leaders in notforprofits with environmental focus, and the like.  This is especially true for LA CAUSA youth who tend to engage in work that improve their communities.  These youth would have led generations of young people into the realm environmental consciousness, resulting in stronger communities advocating for better environmental conditions.  They would also be mentoring young people who continue with the mission to ensure Los Angeles is green and clean.   





The curriculum that Streets2Gardens youth created would have been improved and shared with all of the elementary schools in the United States.

3102160,2013160,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SpeakUp.html,Speak Up When Youre Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement Project, Health,"The mission of the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force is to remove barriers to the prevention, screening and treatment of prenatal and postpartum depression in Los Angeles County. Common barriers include lack of screening, inaccessibility of informed treatment, stigma and lack of reimbursement from payors. In order to address these barriers and increase access to depression screening and treatment services for medically underserved pregnant and postpartum women, the Task Force has been working in partnership with USCEisner Family Medicine Clinic on the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project  a pilot project that embeds maternal mental health care in a primary care setting.





USCEisner FMC is a federally qualified nonprofit community health center dedicated to improving the physical, social, and emotional wellbeing of people in Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles, regardless of their ability to pay. Its patient population includes highrisk, uninsured, underinsured and otherwise medically underserved women and their infants. According to the 2008 LAMB survey, 23.1% percent of new mothers in the catchment area served by USCEisner FMC reported depression during pregnancy and 58.2% reported some level of depression postpartum  a rate roughly twice that of pregnant women nationwide. In addition, many struggle with financial stress, poor social support and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and thyroid disease. Additional risks include linguistic barriers, immigration status, lack of health insurance, obstacles to care such as transportation and childcare, and lack of access to mental health services.





As part of the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, which is based on the IMPACT model, all prenatal and postpartum patients are screened for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders at each visit. Patients who screen positively (10 or more on the PHQ9 or 4 or more on the Edinburgh 3) are connected with an onsite social worker, social work intern and/or occupational therapist, who conducts a full assessment of the patient. These cases are referred to the New Family Care Team, which consists of primary care physicians, social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists and case managers at USCEisner FMC, as well as a consulting perinatal mental health psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed marriage family therapist and a social worker. Members of the New Family Care Team meet on a weekly basis to discuss patients who have presented as high or medium risk for perinatal depression, provide expertise from members' respective disciplines and construct an optimal treatment plan for each case. Treatment options may include individual or group therapy, psychiatric care, medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or psychodynamic psychotherapy, social support and intensive case management with warm referrals to community resources.





Since January 2012, 420 pregnant and postpartum women have been screened for perinatal depression at USCEisner FMC. Positive screens, which account for approximately 33% of all women, are given an extensive intake assessment using a tool developed by the Task Force. The intake/assessment tool includes a comprehensive psychosocial history, including risk factors such as past trauma and loss, domestic violence, substance abuse, immigration status and social support, as well as a complete psychiatric differential diagnosis. Thus far, the intervention appears to be creating a medical home for women and their children, potentially lowering rates of fragmented medical and mental health care and addressing the physical and mental health needs of women and children. The most important observation thus far has been that time and time again, women express reluctance to being given a referral outside of the clinic, but are willing to connect with an ""emotional support person"" who is on the premises. In this way, women are far less likely to fall through the cracks.





The Task Force is currently actively fundraising for the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project so that it can design a data dashboard that will track the project's outcomes. Data sets that will be collected through the dashboard will be used to inform conclusions about the efficiency and costeffectiveness of the IMPACT model of collaborative mental health care as applied to maternal depression.","The Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force was founded in February 2007 by Special Counsel/Legislative Analyst, Kimberly Wong, following her personal experience with severe postpartum depression. The Task Force is a coalition composed of over 35 public and private nonprofit agencies as well community leaders, research partners, advocates for mothers, infants, and families, survivors of maternal depression and affected family members. Through its programs and initiatives, the Task Force aims to: (1) Raise public awareness of the disorder so that women who are suffering are not ashamed or embarrassed to seek help; (2) Increase perinatal depression screening and referral rates among community and health care providers; and (3) Advocate for legislation that supports the identification and treatment of perinatal depression.  





Since its inception, the Task Force has:





*Obtained the dedication of May of every year as Perinatal Depression Awareness Month throughout Los Angeles County and the state of California. 


*Distributed over 800,000 Speak Up When You're Down: Six Things Every New Mom and MomtoBe Should Know About Maternal Depression posters and brochures (available in 7 languages).


*Developed a Training & Technical Assistance program that has delivered tailored perinatal mood disorder trainings to over 1,500 health care and communitybased providers.


*Published a Community Providers Perinatal Mental Health Toolkit, which includes information and handouts on the signs, symptoms, risk factors, effects, screening, assessment, prevention, and intervention for perinatal depression and related mood and anxiety disorders for providers. 


*Launched an innovative, first of its kind, pilot project with USCEisner Family Medicine to implement an IMPACT model in which perinatal mental health is embedded in primary care visits both for screening and intervention. 


*Cosponsored ACR 53 (Hernandez), the Kelly Abraham Martinez Act, which urges hospital providers, mental health care providers, health plans, and insurers to invest resources to educate women about perinatal depression risk factors and triggers. 





The Task Force is a project of 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Community Partners.


","The Task Force will work with the following partners on its Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement project: 





*USCEisner Family Medical Center, a federally qualified nonprofit community health center dedicated to improving the physical, social, and emotional wellbeing of people in Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles, regardless of their ability to pay.





*The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MPCI), a groundbreaking model for large scale community mobilization and transformation where children, living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education, health milestones, the nurturing they receive from their family, and the economic stability of their family. ","The Task Force will contract with an external evaluator to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, including qualitative and quantitative indicators of project success.  Qualitative measures may include feasibility and implementation challenges and successes within the participating clinic and program, as well as program milestone achievements.  Quantitative measures may include descriptive baseline measures of outcomes related to screening and access to care, implementation of screening and intervention protocols and demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables of the patients seen during the research project.  Data elements will include date of birth; marital status; ethnicity; family income; insurance status; age of first prenatal visit; history of mental health; immigration status; evidence of substance abuse, domestic violence, etc.  Other data will include maternal and birth outcomes.  





Benchmarks that will be tracked over the project's life include:





*Number of prenatal and postpartum women at USCEisner FMC to be screened for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders;


*Percentage of screened patients to be provided warm referrals to treatment;


*A cost per patient for embedded maternal mental health care at USCEisner FMC is established;


*A cost per patient for maternal mental health care at comparison site is established;


*Quality outcomes of embedded maternal mental health care at USCEisner FMC are identified;


*Quality outcomes of maternal mental health care at comparison site are identified.





A summative evaluation of progress towards achieving the project's intended objectives will be measured annually through a data dashboard consisting of tracking outputs of participation, attendance, as well as practice outcomes of screening, referring and access to care in representative clinical settings.  The Task Force will utilize these evaluations to regularly revisit the project's goals and strategies and to revise them, if necessary.  ","Perinatal or maternal depression encompasses a range of mood disorders that can affect a woman during pregnancy and around the time of birth.  Mothers who suffer from perinatal depression are atrisk of delivering a preterm baby, a lowbirth weight baby and/or a baby with elevated stress hormones. They are also less likely breastfeed, use car seats, electrical outlet covers or smoke detectors, place her baby on his/her back to sleep, or talk, play or show books to her baby on a daily basis.  A mother suffering from postpartum depression is also more likely to abuse drugs and/or alcohol, display anger and disengagement with her baby and use corporal punishment.  Children of women who are suffering from perinatal depression may display poor weight gain, low selfesteem and behavioral problems.  Most importantly, depression in the postpartum period interrupts healthy bonding between mother and child, leading to impaired cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development in early childhood and beyond.





Of the approximately 150,000 live births occurring in Los Angeles County each year, over 22,000 women experience clinical perinatal depression.  Women who live in disadvantaged populations are particularly susceptible.  Recent studies have demonstrated that in households below the federal poverty threshold, as many as one in four mothers of infants is experiencing moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms. The most recent Los Angeles Mother Baby (LAMB) Survey results identified close to 40% of Hispanic and AfricanAmerican women as experiencing some degree of perinatal depression. 





Highly treatable and often preventable, perinatal depression and related mood disorders are often not diagnosed and/or treated due to lack of screening and inaccessibility of informed treatment.  In fact, 19 percent of women in Los Angeles rate their mental health as fair or poor during their pregnancy, yet 42 percent of new mothers were not asked about feeling depressed during their hospital stays, well baby appointments or 6 weeks postpartum check ups.  





Through its Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement Project, the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force will increase awareness of maternal depression and its impact on the mother, child, family and community at large amongst pregnant and postpartum women, health care and community providers and county policy makers.  As a result, by 2050 all pregnant and postpartum women will be screened for maternal depression during their prenatal visits and postpartum check up and all women who are highrisk for maternal depression will receive treatment. ","Success will that all pregnant and postpartum women are screened for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders during prenatald and postpartum visits by health care and other community providers, and that 100% of high risk patients are provided with a warm referral to an organization or agency that can help them."
3102161,2013161,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/goodfoodla.html,The Good Food Purchasing Program: Building a Local and Sustainable Food Economy for LA, Environmental Quality,"<p>The Good Food Purchasing Pledge (GFPP) harnesses the purchasing power of major institutions to encourage environmentally sustainable food production, healthy eating habits, respect for workersâ€™ rights, humane treatment of animals and support for the local business economy by providing new opportunities for small and midsized farmers and job creation along the supply chain. By building the market for Good Food, GFPP will also provide lowincome residents in urban communities access to affordable, healthy, fair and sustainable food options. </p>





<p>The GFPP initiative is the most comprehensive and metricbased food purchasing policy of its kind in the nation and was developed by the LA Food Policy Council (LAFPC). It is a model that can be easily adopted by other cities. Think LEED, but for Good Food. Just as LEED has provided a critical catalyst to the green building movement, we believe our pledge will be a catalyst for the sustainable food movement in Los Angeles and beyond. The successful implementation of LAFPC's program could create a ripple effect, inspiring other cities and states to take action.  Funding from LA2050 would allow us to expand the number of institutions participating in the program, thus increasing the positive impact on our local environment, economy and community.  </p>





<p>It is well known that the way our food is produced has significant environmental and health impacts.  Factory farming has led to a serious public health threat due to water pollution and the routine use of antibiotics for livestock, which contributes to antibiotic resistant bacteria that can cause human infection; food borne illness is a growing problem worldwide. Agriculture is a top contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and air and water pollution, and it consumes over 80 percent of our stateâ€™s water. Widespread pesticide use pollutes our air and water and exposes farm workers and neighboring communities; farm workers experience twice the national average of cancer rates. </p>





<p>LAâ€™s regional foodshed, which spans the 200 mile, tencounty region, is the largest producer of fruits, vegetables and nuts in the nation. Yet most of our produce is exported outside the region, often at an economic loss to small and midsized farmers. Farmers unable to compete in the global market sell off their land to developers, draining the local economy and also contributing to sprawl. Despite the abundance that surrounds us, many urban residents lack access to fresh and healthy food and consequently suffer from the paradox of hunger and obesity, which disproportionately impacts lowincome communities of color. </p>





<p>With 10 million residents (26% of CA's population), LA County accounts for a significant portion of the food purchased in the state. Due to the size of the LA market, leveraging the purchasing power of large institutions to serve healthy, local and sustainable food can offer enormous benefit to our regionâ€™s producers, health of consumers and workers, and our natural resources. </p>





<p>Large institutions (hospitals, schools, universities) in Los Angeles serve millions of meals every day. These meals should be healthy and prepared with sustainably sourced ingredients. To help reach this goal, the GFPP recognizes and rewards major meal providers that follow healthy, sustainable procurement practices. Through a point system, the program promotes increasing levels of achievement in five crucial categories: (1) local economies, (2) environmental sustainability, (3) valued workforce, (4) animal welfare, and (5) nutrition. To encourage participation, our program provides technical assistance in sourcing, monitoring progress, and measuring and recognizing success. With a clear standard to aspire to, institutions will demand better ingredients from producers and provide better meals to consumers. </p>





<p>Recent adoption of GFPP by the City of LA and LA Unified School District (LAUSD) marks a major accomplishment in the strengthening of a sustainable regional food system. Through this program, we are working to increase the consumption of Good Food and improve the quality of 750,000 meals served daily by LAUSD and City of LA nutrition programs and facilities. This will also create an economic shift to increase affordability and availability of Good Food, with resulting benefit to the water, air, and public health of all.</p>





<p>Successful implementation and scalability of GFPP requires infrastructure to enable institutions to comply with GFPPâ€™s standards. Funding from LA2050 would help LAFPC recruit more institutions to adopt the Good Food Purchasing Pledge and support implementation efforts, including technical assistance and an annual public recognition event for Good Food Purchasers and Good Food Vendor Showcase at City Hall on national Food Day to celebrate purchasersâ€™ commitment and progress, while facilitating relationships between growers, distributors, vendors and GFPP institutions.</p>


","<p>In just two years since it was established, LAFPC has been recognized as one of the largest and most advanced food policy councils in the state, with the broadest reach of any such council in the country. LAFPC is the subject of two national evaluations and was profiled as a model in a report by the Applied Research Center entitled, Good Food+Good Jobs For All: Challenges and Opportunities to Advance Racial and Economic Equity in the Food System.</p>


<p>Key LAFPC achievements include:</p>


<p>â€¢ Good Food Purchasing Pledge. LAFPC developed and successfully advanced the most comprehensive Good Food Procurement policy in the nation. The policy was adopted by the City of LA through a Mayoral executive directive and a LA City Council motion on 10/24/2012, and by the LAUSD, the second largest food purchaser in California, on 11/13/2012. GFPP is the first municipal food procurement policy in the country to include labor standards.</p>


<p>â€¢ Community Market Conversion (CMC) Collaborative. LAFPC created the CMC Collaborative to continue the work of the Community Redevelopment Agencyinitiated CMC program and received funding for at least three additional store conversions, in partnership with a CDFI. LAFPC has pioneered the use of business and leadership development trainings for neighborhood markets interested in offering healthier fare. The first event, â€œFrom Corner Store to Community Grocer: Everything You Need To Know To Be a Healthy Food Retailer,â€ held in July 2012, offered over a dozen workshops and provided storeowners and community groups with technical, marketing and produce management skills to expand healthy food retail. Over 150 people participated, including 60 storeowners from across LA County.  The second training, held on March 19, 2013, focused on Korean American store owners.</p>


<p>â€¢ National Food Day, October 24, 2012. LAFPC organized an information fair in City Hall Rotunda of its seven Working Groupsâ€™ priorities and achievements with over 100 guests; hosted a speakersâ€™ program with an announcement and signing by Mayor Villaraigosa of the Good Food Purchasing Policy executive directive, and comments from Council Members Paul Koretz and Jan Perry, and Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Director of LA County Department of Public Health; received a Food Day resolution from Council Member Eric Garcetti; followed by the unanimous adoption of the Good Food Procurement motion by City Council.</p>


<p>â€¢ Good Food Day LA â€“ A Day of Service, March 31, 2012. In partnership with the Mayorâ€™s office, LAFPC conducted a citywide awareness and volunteer service event, coordinating 1,000 volunteers and over 100 organizations. The event drew over 3,000 participants.</p>


<p>â€¢ Infrastructure & Capacity Development. LAFPC organized a network of nearly 700 stakeholders from 325 organizations into a thriving and cohesive collaborative of seven high functioning Working Groups and 40member leadership body to guide the Good Food vision and framework. </p>","LAFPC is uniquely positioned to successfully advance and implement GFPP, with its extended network of 300 organizations from across the food system. GFPP was developed with input from nearly 100 individuals  farmers, distributors, and food purchasers, and labor, environmental, public health and animal welfare experts. A Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) will help guide implementation of the initiative, working closely with the City of LA, LAUSD, and LA County Department of Public Health. TAC members also include individuals from California Food Policy Advocates, Food Chain Workers Alliance, and industry experts in sustainable food systems. We will regularly update our network on implementation and engage them in promotion efforts. ","<p>The University of WisconsinMadison has assisted us in the development of an evaluation plan and assessment tools to measure progress with our process and the initiativeâ€™s short and long term impacts, which we have begun to implement. </p>





<p>In Year One of the program, purchasers will submit a baseline assessment of the total annual dollar amount of food purchases by food category. Purchasers are then asked to submit a quarterly inventory of purchasing data with information on: 1) food item; 2) volume; 3) cost; 4) source (farm level). From this baseline assessment, LAFPC will work with the departments to establish a fiveyear GFPP implementation plan with annual benchmarks, starting with the goal of allocating 15 percent of their annual food purchases towards our five value categories within one year and gradually increasing that amount over time. We will measure and report on GFPP participantsâ€™ progress to City Council annually. </p>





<p>Another major goal of our program is to develop internal leadership within purchasing institutions and to work in collaboration with the institutions to establish a value chain that works for purchasers, consumers and suppliers.  LAFPC staff will work closely with our partner institutions to assess their experience in order to improve the efficacy of GFPP implementation.  In addition to individual technical assistance, we will host semiannual technical assistance meetings with all purchasers and their vendors. We will survey participants at each meeting to assess increased understanding of the Good Food values and their importance, experience with implementation, and changes in value chain relationships as a result of the program. </p>





<p>Short term success will be measured by: </p>


<p> Percentage increase in dollar amount and volume of food purchases identified as local, sustainable, fair, humane, and healthy</p>


<p> Number of meals served each day impacted by GFPP </p>


<p> Number of institutions that have adopted GFPP</p>


<p> Number of institutions that have met their annual benchmarks </p>


<p> Number of new Good Food suppliers that have entered institutional supply chains as a result of the program.</p>


<p> Increased transparency in the supply chain</p>


<p> Statewide and national expansion of GFPP </p>





<p>In addition to evaluating short term outcomes for GFPP, LAFPC will measure the GFPPâ€™s contributions to the following longterm outcomes:</p> 


<p>1.	Improvements in regional environment in terms of air quality, land use and water quality</p>


<p>2.	Improvements in farmer livelihoods</p>


<p>3.	Improvements in worker equity</p>


<p>4.	Improvements in health outcomes of underserved communities in LA County</p>


<p>5.	Improvements in accessibility of Good Food in LA County</p> 





<p>Through our research, we will work with a university partner to conduct a case study evaluation of one purchaserâ€™s supply chain impacts on these value categories.</p>","Reduce Food System Environmental Impacts: Through their commitment to purchase at least 15% of annual food purchases from sustainable and local sources, LA institutions will contribute to our regionâ€™s environmental sustainability targets by reducing chemical inputs (such as pesticides and fertilizer) and food miles. Institutions are also encouraged to reduce meat consumptionâ€”a key strategy for improving public health and sustainabilityâ€”as livestock farming is one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. 





Influence Food Production Decisions: Increased demand for fairly and sustainably produced food from large institutional purchasers will encourage LA area farmers to shift towards more environmentally and socially sustainable growing practices. With more institutions adopting GFPP, we will provide market opportunities for farms that decrease or eliminate chemical inputs; avoid the use of hormones and antibiotics; conserve land, soil, and water; protect and enhance biodiversity; and reduce onfarm energy consumption and GHG emissions. 





Strengthen the LA Regional Food Infrastructure: We will build market relationships between GFPP purchasers and GFPP producers by working with partners to establish a LA Regional Food Hub. A food hub, supported by regular institutional demand, will provide necessary infrastructure to scale up the supply of local Good Food and make wholesome Good Food options affordable in small neighborhood markets in underserved LA neighborhoods.





Climate Change Adaptability: Locally produced and sustainably harvested produce and fish ensure food security by avoiding disruptions in the supply chain or lapses in quality control. Moreover, a region that can generate its own food is less susceptible to fluctuations in the national and global food supply. 





It is also important for us to ensure that everyone living in the LA region has access to Good Food. LAUSD is a vital part of this goal. As the second largest school district in the country, they provide lunch to 650,000 students daily, 80% of whom receive free or reduced meals. Additionally, City government facilities reach at least 100,000 residents daily, through nutrition programs, employee cafeterias, and concessionaires. We will also work with universities and hospitals to expand GFPP. GFPP will ensure increased access to fresh, high quality local food to those who need it most.





Create Local Jobs: Rebuilding our regional food system can create good, local jobs throughout the food chainâ€”in food production, processing, distribution, food service, and waste. A localized food system can greatly benefit the LA economy because small, local farms, suppliers, and their employees are more likely to spend income locally, recirculating 2 to 4 times the capital they spend. For example, through LAUSDâ€™s GFPP commitment, local farmers, processors, warehouses, distributors and workers could receive at least $13 million annually. 


","<p>By 2050, the Good Food Purchasing Pledge will make valuable contributions to a wide range of important food systems issues, bringing California closer to a healthy, just and sustainable food system for all, as measured by the following outcomes: </p>





<p>1.	Improvements in environmental stewardship practices, as measured by reductions in water contamination by pesticides; decline in nitrogen pollution from farming systems; decline in greenhouse gas emissions related to agricultural production methods, distance, and meat consumption; preservation of farmland; improvements in soil quality and percentage decline in agricultural related water use. </p>





<p>2.	Improvements in livestock living conditions measured by decline in number of confined animal feeding operations; decrease in animal feed production, including alfalfa, corn, soy etc.; decrease in meat consumption.</p>





<p>3.	Improvements in farmer livelihoods as measured by increased crop diversity as measured by top 10 crops per county in production; acreage of small and midscale family farms (less than 500 acres) holding stable; increase in new generation, women, minority, disabled, or veteran farmers; and average net farm income of small and midscale family farms matches or exceeds median national household income.</p>





<p>4.	Improvements in worker equity as measured by number of food workers that receive wages sufficient to support a household for fulltime work; decline in percentage of these food workers who use food stamps; increased rates of union density rates for food chain workers.</p>





<p>5.	Improvements in health outcomes of underserved communities in LA County, as measured by declines in rates of diet related disease prevalence; childhood and adult overweight and obesity; decreased health care costs; decreased use of antibiotics in livestock; and reductions in food safety outbreaks;</p>





<p>6.	Improvements in accessibility of Good Food in LA County as measured by number of corner markets sourcing Good Food because of improvements made in distribution infrastructure catalyzed by GFPP institution participation.</p>





<p>By 2050, the Good Food Purchasing Pledge will be replicated throughout the state and country and will be the national institutional food procurement standard. GFPP will transform the way food is produced, purchased, and consumed in Los Angeles, California, and the U.S. The headline will read  A Taste of Change: LA Leads a Groundbreaking Initiative, which Transforms Millions of Meals, Minds, Bodies and Fields</p>"
3102162,2013162,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/stimulateLA.html,S(t)imulate LA, Environmental Quality,"If you had the keys to Los Angeles, what would it look like in 2050? Using the LA Forumâ€™s online city generator game, S(t)imulate LA, you can make planning decisions, set zoning policy, and create regulatory incentives to set Los Angeles on a path toward fulfilling your vision in the next 37 years.





What many residents of LA donâ€™t realize is that the Cityâ€™s planning policies restrict a lot of development and have at times resulted in challenging the implementation of ideas that would make LA a more sustainable, connected, innovative, and fun place to live. Planning decisions have a direct impact on our open space, air quality, and water supply and quality. By manipulating the City of LAâ€™s current planning and building policies, we can generate an alternate city that could be healthier, happier, and wiser, all while accommodating the explosive population boom that we expect to continue in Southern California.





This free website game, which we plan to jointly develop with 880 Cities, the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab, and software developer Esri, allows players to become the master planner for LA, toggling through a series of metrics that establish a basis for how the city could potentially develop. Once the metrics are defined, players push â€œgoâ€ and watch as the city transforms based on project population increases and climate changes over 37 years before coming to a rest at 2050.





The resulting city that emerges from each playerâ€™s choices can be saved and shared with other players to form a larger online conversation about how we as LA residents can improve the city. At the end of six months of play, the LA Forum will organize the best LA scenarios from the website into an interactive exhibit in our Hollywood gallery, where they will be shared with the general public, as well as reviewed by city planners, politicians, and members of LAâ€™s urban design and architecture communities. We will host a series of discussions aimed at analyzing the gameâ€™s outcomes for potential influence on future planning in the city.





The gameâ€™s outcomes are influenced by two sets of variablesâ€”baseline metrics and projections that can be dialed up or down and big ideas that have the potential to change the geography and morphology of Los Angeles. Examples of the metrics will include the following as a minimum, but we expect to create more as the game develops:





(1) Access to transportation and commute length/time/type;


(2) Access to green/open/recreation space;


(3) Zoning districts (commercial, residential, industrial);


(4) Density;


(5) Environmental conditions (air quality, water quality, microclimates);


(6) Demographic changesâ€”population aging and immigration;


(7) Opportunities for broadening the taxbase;





Examples of big ideas could include:





(1) Highspeed rail;


(2) Coastal redevelopment to combat global warming;


(3) Habitat restoration;


(4) LA River redevelopment;


(5) Changing energy usage and generation;


(6) Regionalizing airtravel;





We hope the game will provide a platform for reconsidering the City of LAâ€™s planning and building policies, informing a muchneeded debate that will start as the City begins to internally revise its own policies throughout the coming years.


","The LA Forum was founded in 1987 by a group of designers, architects, planners, and educators who wanted to provide an alternative platform for critical discussion on the built environment in Los Angeles and Southern California. The Forum has organized lectures, symposia, events, exhibitions, competitions, and publications throughout its history. We are a nonprofit organization that operates outside of the realms of professional practice and architecture schools. Our members consist of architects, planners, engineers, designers, educators, students, artists, and other people interested in the built environment in Los Angeles.





Our publication history includes a significant pamphlet series between 2003 and 2010 that included Dead Malls, Out the Window (LAX), Polar Inertia, After the City, This (Is How We Live), Pendulum Plane, and Meet the Nelsons. The series explored Los Angeles urban design and architecture through creative responses, such as comic book styles and fake screenplays, as well as through speculative architectural projects as part of the Forumâ€™s sponsorship of competitions. In addition, the Forum has published a quarterly newsletter since our founding that provides space for critical thinkers to write about Los Angeles. We have also published largerscale books, including Experimental Architecture in Los Angeles (Rizzoli International) and Everyday Urbanism (Monacelli Press).





The Forumâ€™s public events, including lectures and symposia, continue to play an active role in the identity of LA design. One of our most significant past events focused on the aftermath of the LA Uprisings in 1992, when we brought together our members and the National Organization of Minority Architects for the event â€œAlternative Disorders: On Designing Communities.â€ We also sponsor quarterly Pecha Kucha events for designers to share their work with the community, as well as a lecture series called â€œOut There Doing Itâ€ that spotlights emerging design practices and the â€œOn the Mapâ€ series that provides architectural tours of buildings given by the architects who designed them.





In our 25year history, we have sponsored design competitions to focus attention on opportunities for rethinking the vitality of urban LA. These have included Civic Innovations (1994), Dead Malls (2003), Liner (2008), and Dingbat 2.0 (2010). Our most recent competition on Dingbats focused on the reinvention of this classic LA housing prototype for a new generation of urban citizens, resulting in a forthcoming book and an exhibition of the competition entries. 


The Forum continues to actively engage all of Los Angeles and has two exhibitions planned this summer for our space in the Woodbury University Hollywood gallery. These exhibitions focus on alternative housing typologies for Los Angeles and will be open throughout the summer for free to the public.


","880 Cities (www.880cities.org) is a nonprofit organization based in Toronto, Canada, that is dedicated to the transformation of cities into places where people can walk, bike, access public transit, and visit vibrant parks and public places.





The USC Annenberg Innovation Lab(www.annenberglab.com) is 


comprised of researchers of social media communications whose key interest is in garnering live participation from the public and enabling social action.





Esri (www.esri.com) is a leading developer of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and software that underpins the design and planning of cities throughout the world. Esri is committed to developing tools that professionals need for planning sustainable, connected, and healthy cities.","We will measure overall success based on the number of scenarios generated through the game. The LA Forum also plans to host a series of events around the gameâ€™s use, where participants will develop their scenarios and then use them as a platform for discussing the ideas behind planning and building policies in Los Angeles. We also expect to engage staff within the City of LA on the use of the game and what lessons they might draw in terms of how it could impact the work they do in revising and updating planning and building regulations for the City.","Planning and building in Los Angeles tends to be an isolated affair, where the public is engaged only when it directly affects their neighborhood. Through a fun game, we expect to reach out to a larger audience to educate them about how planning and building policy that addresses the entire city accumulates to affect broader quality of life issues. We also think the outcomes of this game, our hosted events, and the exhibition of the best scenarios will create opportunities to engage with the City of LAâ€™s planning and building departments on the subject of zoning and development in Los Angeles. Our hope is to identify mechanisms through policy or strategic investment by these agencies that could have the greatest impact on the development of LA through 2050.","In 2050, we would expect to have one of the most progressive zoning, planning, and building policies in the world, but it will take incremental steps to get there. The LA Forumâ€™s game would start that process by establishing gaming as a credibleâ€”and enjoyableâ€”way to consider difficult planning issues for LA. By 2050, we expect that gaming and simulation will replace policy documents and that every proposed design or redevelopment of LA will be simulated in realtime to understand how it will impact the greater LA Basin.

3102163,2013163,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/lamakerspace.html,Central Educational Network Based On The Apprenticeship Model, Education,"<p>At the Los Angeles Makerspace we are built on the premise of connected learning and the need to reimagine learning. An important part of the learning process involves both mentorship and social support in order to guide people towards knowledge and expertise. Research has shown repeatedly that when people have more access to expert peers, mentors, and coaches, learning is much more effective and resilient. Additionally, teaching and helping others can be one of the best ways to learn more too, independent of oneâ€™s current level of expertise.</p>








<p>Our idea is to extend LA Makerspace from a weekend tinkering space to a central educational network based on the apprenticeship model with weekday afterschool programs. We want to develop our space into a rich environment where students can create peer mentoring groups and have access to experts in the community to establish mentoring relationships through projectbased learning.</p>








<p>In the spirit of sharing with everyone in LA and beyond, we will be sharing our learning practices and curriculum licensed under Creative Commons CC BYSA hosted on P2PU.org, an online educational platform and community. Our goal is to provide passionate learners, both those traditionally designated as teachers and students, with civicallyengaged projectbased learning opportunities tied to STEAM subjects. The P2PU platform gives anyone in the world an opportunity to learn about topics they might not otherwise have access to, connect with others who share the same interests both online in the P2PU class, and create their own communities around a project. In addition, we are linking STEAMrelated learning to citizen action by enabling people to mobilize science and engineering to make an impact in their neighborhood and around the world. Learning from the ground up from the basics of how to construct electronics to how to calibrate gathered data to how to test theories and develop other models. The opportunities presented are for these learners to connect with the research and advocacy communities around Los Angeles and beyond, learning how to both be scientifically literate and apply science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics in a meaningful way.</p>








<p>Our idea will impact the Education Indicator through higher test scores from our participating students, a more diverse population joining STEAM majors, an increased percentage of college graduates, highly competent citizens ready to compete with a highlyeducated workforce and a really passionate and fun community to be.</p>","<p>We are incredibly proud of the achievements our organization has made in the past year. We could not have done it without a passionate board of directors (4 women, 3 men) and an extremely supportive community. </p>








<p>In less than one year we have opened a space in downtown LA, hired two staff members and programmed more than 40 successful events and workshops including programming, design, citizen science, film, woodworking and food science hacking.</p>








<p>We have had a lot of support and attention localling in Los Angeles and nationally. The White House  Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote about our incredible efforts: http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/12/12/makingmakerslosangeles</p>








<p>We ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and reached our goal in the first 30 hours, proving that there is demand and interest in the maker movement and projectbased learning.</p>








<p>We have developed and have begun running a student research program whereby students are mentored in the development of their own research projects as well as getting them involved with current research projects.  Our current partners are the environmental monitoring group Safecast, the American Physics Society, the West Side Science Club, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and the California Institute of Technology.</p>

Science Teachers And Research","<p>The ultimate goal for LA Makerspace is to connect students to the larger world of research, design, and development.  In the process providing the academic and professional support needed for a meaningful connection between students and research partners.  To this end LA Makerspace seeks to accomplish three goals:</p>








<p>LA Makerspace seeks to improve studentsâ€™ abilities in the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) fields as measured by traditional metrics such as an increase in the participating schoolsâ€™ average California Standards Test scores in math and science, as well as a corresponding increase in math and science scores for Advanced Placement exams. </p>








<p>We seek to increase student interest in STEAM fields, particularly from traditionally underrepresented populations, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of students from participating schools choosing to major in such fields after graduation from high school. </p> 








<p>LA Makerspace seeks to strengthen the academic and professional skills needed to succeed in college, particularly within a STEAM major, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of students from participating schools who graduate from college with a STEAM major.</p>


","The LA Makerspace is committed to fostering innovation and embracing community. We chose Downtown LA / South LA as our neighborhood as it is conveniently within reach of public transportation, providing ready access to a variety of neighborhoods independent of their socioeconomic status.








LA Makerspace provides shared physical resources otherwise unaffordable or attainable by an individual or family. It provides a fluid workspace in order to facilitate the collaboration, inspiration and encouragement of others. The maker movement, as it pertains to education, seeks to build the confidence, analytic skills, and creativity of those involved by establishing an environment centered on the creative act. This collaborative and projectbased approach to learning runs counter to the current trend in education of defining academic success in terms of standardized tests, especially at the cost of handson programs such as shop, art, and laboratory science. It is a place to learn about engineering, design, and research through both organized classes as well as openended projects.








As an educational endeavor LA Makerspace provides a community meeting point for projects ranging from robotics to filmmaking, as well as a shared lab space for community members to develop their own projects and work with partnered research institutions within our citizen science program.  This community of practice also includes the running of teacher workshops whereby current educators meet, with students and professionals, to design and test various projects to run in and outside the traditional classroom.








LA Makerspace bridges the gap between academia and the communityatlarge by establishing a peertopeer mentorship network and giving members the chance to apprentice into a whole variety of fields ranging from industrial design to data analysis. The ultimate goal for LA Makerspace is to foster productive community members.","<p>Ultimately success would be LAUSD incorporating our methods and practices directly into their schools because they recognized that we have successfully met our key performance indicators of higher test scores from our participating students, a more diverse population joining STEAM majors, an increased percentage of college graduates and highly competent citizens ready to compete with a highlyeducated workforce.</p>








<p>Through our mentorship network and community of researchers, designers, and other professionals we will also develop Los Angelesâ€™ reputation as an innovation center in fields beyond entertainment through the crosspollination of various fields.  Research institutions in Los Angeles will improve the practice of education through the establishment of apprenticeship programs in affiliated research and development work.  Custom manufacturing centers, built around newlyaffordable technologies such as 3D printing and laser cutting, will allow the design and retail to occur together in near real time throughout the city.  Finally, the students who participate in this project, being creators as well as consumers of education, will create a far more dynamic city in their adulthood.</p>"
3102164,2013164,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FruitVegetableOasis.html,A Garden of Hope A South LA Oasis of locally produced Vegetables and Fruits , Environmental Quality,"<p>Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust will transform an empty nuisance lot, located in a â€œfood desertâ€ in one of LAâ€™s most parkpoor areas, into an oasis of healthy food, community green space and economic opportunity. An urban fruit orchard, park and neighborhood farm standâ€”managed by residents and featuring produce grown by community garden membersâ€”will bring fresh foods and a safe place to exercise to a community severely lacking in both.</p>


<p>The project site is a 1acre abandoned lot at 10500 S. Normandie Avenue, Los Angeles 90044. This is a parkpoor unincorporated area of LA County in a zip code where: 54% of annual household incomes are below $25,000; 54% of residents are Latino; 45% are African American; Almost 40% live below the poverty line; 29% have less than a 9th grade education; 41% are under 19; and there are 0.01 park acres per 1,000 people (Predominately white LA neighborhoods enjoy 31.8 acres of park space per 1,000 people).</p>


<p>This densely populated, underserved community does not come close to meeting the National Recreation and Parks Associationâ€™s recommendation of 10 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. The area is also what is known as a food desert. The majority of residents are more than 1 mile from a supermarket and most food available is packaged and processed, similar to those offerings found at convenience stores and gas stations. This inequitable distribution of green space and food access is a pressing urban and environmental justice issue which we are addressing with this project. </p>


<p>We recently acquired the site through a donation from LA County and have already secured funds to construct 40 4x8 community garden beds and plant half the trees needed for an urban fruit orchard. As part of First 5 LA's ""Little Green Fingers"" program, we are building a ""tot trail"" (walk/bike/trike area) and learning garden designed for children 05 and their family members.</p>


<p>An LA2050 award would allow us to develop the whole site and serve the entire community by bringing open green space and fresh produce. A farm stand will offer fruits, vegetables and herbs grown by local farmers and members of the 40bed community garden. Those without the time or ability to care for their own plot will still enjoy healthy, lowcost foods and interact with farmers and growers. An urban fruit orchard will provide additional farm stand offerings and a beautiful landscape with plenty of shade. A storage container with a cistern and solar panels will minimize energy needs. Open green space with picnic tables and a climbing wall will provide play and exercise opportunities and respite from the urban environment.</p>


<p>Land Trust Community Organizers will work with residents to form a stewardship committee to assist in maintaining and caring for the site. Resident gardeners will be able to earn extra income by selling their produce and take classes in financial literacy and entrepreneurship. The farm stand will be open to the public. The management of the farm stand will offer additional economic opportunities. A farm manager will partner with external farmers within a 50mile radius, coordinate food delivery and lead outreach and education efforts, including offering financial classes to resident gardeners. This could include the creation of a farmbox program, wherein subscribers would receive a weekly package of produce and educational materials on how to store and prepare them. In the future, the farm manager could facilitate programs in gardening, nutrition and cooking, bringing together local students, seniors from the senior housing across the street, and those involved with the children's garden. A farm stand assistant will offer support during the farm standâ€™s hours of operation.</p>


<p>LA2050 funds would be used to: complete the urban fruit orchard; build and maintain a farm stand (with scales, crates, storage, etc.); create farm manager and farm stand assistant positions; and offer financial training.</p>


<p>The Garden of Hope A South LA Green Oasis will impact the environmental quality of the South LA community by adding a 1acre green space to this extremely parkpoor area. This will have a profound effect on the health of the physical landscape, people and natural habitat.</p>


<p>The natural surfaces will reduce the local heat island effect, counteracting the atmospheric heat caused by the surrounding concrete and other heatretaining, nonreflective surfaces. Plants and trees will improve air quality and offer permeable surfaces to clean water as it flows to the ocean, reducing urban runoff and pollution. Plant life will attract animals in an otherwise concrete environment, providing a unique urban habitat. </p>


<p>Residents will gain: a safe green space to play, exercise and relax; improved air quality; access to fresh produce; and the ability to transform their neighborhood on social and economic levels.</p>","The Land Trustâ€™s most important achievements to date are the creation of 10 parks and gardens in the most underserved areas of LA, adding four acres of green space in 11 years. Our mission is to build healthier, stronger and safer neighborhoods through the creation of urban parks and community gardens. We are dedicated to bringing accessible, recreational green spaces to LAâ€™s most parkpoor areas. Through grassroots organizing, community leadership development, and programming, we empower residents in lowincome areas to transform their neighborhoods through action, involvement and ownership. This unique and highly effective business model delivers parks and gardens where they are needed most, eliminating bureaucracy and assuring longterm sustainability. Based on census tract data, we currently serve approximately 21,240 residents annually with our parks and gardens, and will add the equivalent of seven football fields of green space by 2015. 





In 2012, we completed six projects, including: building two new parks (Fox & Laurel Park & Community Garden, set to open summer 2013); a new childrenâ€™s community garden (MariposaNabi); a community garden at an existing park (Unidad); and a major remodel of another garden (MC Francis). Through a tax default process for nonprofits, we were able to purchase an existing garden (Glazer) and protect it from public auction. We worked with committee members to hold 50 community meetings, 15 cleanups and 10 communityled events, and offered leadership training and educational and recreational programming. 





In a general sense, our most important achievement is the creation and implementation of a unique methodology. We emphasize grassroots organizing and community involvement in the creation and management of our spaces. We work with the community to identify vacant land in lowincome areas for future park and garden sites. Properties are acquired feesimple or leased and held in perpetuity to ensure protection of the site. Outreach is performed in the surrounding Â¼ mile, mobilizing nonprofits, schools, parents, health clinics and community groups. Meetings are held to see if residents want a park and what facilities they desire. Community Organizers help residents create a park stewardship committee, identify neighborhood needs and train volunteers to spearhead planning, development and maintenance. Whether the goal is to grow fresh foods, provide afterschool activities or create a place of beauty, projects fulfill community needs. Our management approach ensures longterm community involvement, proper maintenance and stewardship.","South Central Farmers, an LAbased nonprofit organization, will offer guidance, mentorship and possibly training to the farm manager and farm stand assistant. Our additional partners will include: LA Conservation Corps, The Better World Group, LA Community Garden Council, and UC Cooperative Extension.





Our project has strong support from LA County Supervisor MarkRidleyThomas (SD2), the community, local businesses, schools and senior centers.","Success will be measured by: the completion of the 105th & Normandie Green Oasis Community Farm Stand, Urban Fruit Orchard and Park site; the hiring of a farm manager and farm stand assistant; the opening and continued operation of the farm stand; and the community revenue generated by the farm stand.





The longterm result will be the empowerment of the community to create an infrastructure of stakeholders invested in community improvement, leading to increased health, safety and quality of life. Success will be based on important milestones in the community organizing, development, construction and implementation stages. The project will be managed through the various milestones, culminating in the opening of the site.





Our evaluation will include working closely with the community throughout the planning and development stages of the project to ensure it meets neighborhood needs. We will evaluate the success of this process by delivering the green space to the community with the support of the farm manager and farm stand assistant.





We will collect quantitative and qualitative information to ensure we are maximizing the projectâ€™s capacity to be a force for positive change. Community Organizers will conduct a yearend assessment to evaluate programming, partnerships, maintenance and community safety. This evaluation will inform goal setting and strategies for the following year.","Negative impacts of living in a parkpoor community include increased health problems and decreased quality of life. A new study found that 36% of LA children are overweight and the cityâ€™s Latino and AfricanAmerican populations have higher than average rates of obesity. The cause is clearly related to the fact that they do not have access to fresh foods or safe places to exercise and recreate. Parks, gardens and farm stands play a fundamental role in the wellbeing of communities, providing places to play, to exercise and to access fresh produce.





Public health studies of urban communities have found that parks and gardens provide residents positive and cumulative health benefits including: lower rates of obesity and diabetes; lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels; fewer minor medical complaints; lower selfreported stress levels; lower rates of crime and domestic violence; and improved air and water quality. Children living within 2/3 of a mile from a park can be up to 500% more likely to have a healthy weight, and exposure to nature can reduce stress by almost 1/3. However, without the Land Trust project, the underserved community surrounding 105th & Normandie will have little opportunity to reap these health and social benefits.





Our project will provide a 1acre green space, transforming a food desert into a neighborhood green oasis, providing a plentiful source of fresh, healthy food. We estimate serving 3,000 to 5,000 annually. Residents will have easy access to inexpensive, local and seasonal produce that can be used as the foundation for a healthy lifestyle. Children will benefit from an early introduction to healthy eating and the farmtotable concept and explore appealing alternatives to the processed, unhealthy foods that form the majority of edible offerings in food deserts. Gardening has been demonstrated to increase children's nutrition knowledge and preference regarding fruit and vegetable consumption and to change behaviors regarding vegetable consumption. By lending a hand in the community garden and interacting with farm stand employees, children will form meaningful connections with their food and establish healthy habits from a young age. Open green spaces will enable residents to exercise and recreate in a safe environment.





Economic opportunities will further benefit the community. Community garden members will be able to sell the produce they grow onsite and take financial literacy classes. The farm manager and farm stand assistant will provide employment for additional residents.





Social and cultural strife are serious issues facing the 105th & Normandie community. Our project will offer opportunities for positive interactions among neighbors, who may have few occasions to get to know one another. Whether trading produce, offering gardening tips or simply sharing a bench, residents will strengthen relationships within their community.","For the Land Trust, success in the arena of environmental quality would mean equitable amounts of green space for all LA residents, at least meeting the National Recreation and Parks Associationâ€™s recommendation of 10 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. LA would no longer have the least access to parks compared to seven major U.S. cities and would, instead, stand as a nationwide example of a more livable urban environment. 





The Garden of Hope, A Green Oasis Community Farm Stand, Urban Fruit Orchard and Park would serve as a model for dozens of similar sites throughout LA. All urban neighborhoods would include natural green spaces for play, exercise and recreation, and building developers would construct them as fundamental components of all new site plans. Community farm stands would replace convenience stores as heavilytrafficked food shopping areas making food deserts a relic of the past. Children would see, feel, taste and grow a myriad of fruits and vegetables from a very young age, establishing good eating habits and growing into environmental stewards.





As a result of the increased green space, air quality would continue to improve and bees, migratory birds and other beneficial species would frequent the cityâ€™s plethora of urban parks and gardens. Quality of life and health, particularly in lowincome communities of color, would drastically improve, and rates of asthma, obesity, diabetes, depression and other chronic diseases would plummet. Schools would utilize 105th & Normandie and other garden and park sites as resources for food, scientific and agricultural learning, and physical education.





Regardless of color and socioeconomic status, LA residents would be within easy walking distance of a park, garden and farm stand offering fresh fruits and vegetables. Inequalities of green space would be rectified and lowincome communities of color would have as much access to green space as affluent, white communities.





In short, the LA environment would transform from a force hindering human development to one enhancing human development.





For the Land Trust, we would continue to be guided by the specific needs and desires of the communities we serve, striving to offer lifechanging community spaces, programs and resources."
3102165,2013165,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LARB2050.html,Los Angeles Review of Books,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"We are trying to establish a major institution for cultural exchange and conversation, centered on an online review of arts and culture. Los Angelesbased and Los Angelesfocused, the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB) is the communal product of many minds, including some of the best know and most established figures on the L.A. cultural scene, along with emerging L.A. writers in the fields of literature, art, music, politics, and cultural studies, enhanced and enlarged by the active conversation of readers all over the city, the county, the state, and beyond. We work hard to bring the worlds of publishing, academia, film and television, new media, art, and music together with the common reader in a fruitful, productive, and engaging conversation.  In a feudal world, there is no criticism; only the king's taste matters. Given the cosmopolitan collection of diverse cultures here in Los Angeles, literature, the arts, and culture need a critical conversation, need to have spokespeople and champions and translators and critics to help cultural work find its audience, to build bridges among communities, and to disseminate the best that is being thought, written, and produced here in Los Angeles to the full range of local audiences and out into the larger world.  Cultural criticism has a long and important history, and for the last 150 years it has taken place largely in a print world supported by advertising and subscription. That world is dying, as seen as the shuttering of book review supplements in almost every city in the country, and the shrinking of book and arts coverage elsewhere. LARB aims not just to replace these lost venues, which have been central to the vibrancy of American culture over the last century and more, but to rethink them, reinvent them using all of the new media tools at our disposal, making the cultural conversation more diverse, more interactive, and more wideranging, less hemmed in by traditional models. By merging the worlds of traditional literary publishing, academia, small presses, online writing, film and television, and the explosion of desktop production of all kinds, LARB hopes to build a big cultural tent, creating a space for very fragmented communities to interact and learn from each other.  LARB is a daily online publication that has already, in a small way, begun this transformation. We are a largely volunteer organization that has managed to post over 1300 indepth reviews, essays, and interviews, produced by a wide variety of contributors, from firsttime writers to some of the most esteemed figures in literature, art, music, film, television, politics, and culture. We have already seen the impact on the morale of writers and readers in L.A., and we hope to increase our presence and impact, bringing our work to a larger audience, and a wider array of audiences, as described below. We also will impact the arts and culture scene through innovative public programming around the city, and through developing innovative curricula for our schools.  In sharing culture and cultures, communities thrive. We are not interested in art for art's sake, or criticism for criticism's sake. We think that literature, art, and culture are central ways that a society understands itself, incubates its own progress, and forges its bonds across what might otherwise be divides. We hope to be a major partner in helping Los Angeles arts and culture continue to significantly enhance human development.  We believe that all art and culture is both local and (at least potentially) global at the same time, and that a central way to ensure the continuing vitality of the L.A. arts and culture scene is to disseminate its work nationally and globally. We also believe that while the world has taken notice of L.A.'s excellence in classical music and art, as well as, of course film and television, it has been slower to recognize L.A.'s literary and critical strengths. We have started to have a real impact in that area and hope to do much more. Criticism and conversation are necessary to incubation, to nurturing, and to bringing literature, the arts, and culture to their largest possible audience, and thus to have their greatest impact, to realize their greatest potential.","We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to the cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation in the lost art of editing. We have built something the literary, artistic, & intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud to have represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary community. The New Yorker called us â€œan instant jewel of the internet,â€ Pico Iyer said we are â€œlike 1000 angels descending,â€ Salman Rushdie claims ours was the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz & Michael Tolkin call LARB â€œthe best literary magazine in the country.â€ But more importantly the best writers in the country want to write for us, & continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but also from New York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We have been recognized by the publishing industry in Publisherâ€™s Weekly, the business community in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher Education, & many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily achievements in bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully curated, edited, & factchecked essays, reviews and interviews and the conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other words, our site is our achievement, an evergrowing, intelligently interlinked conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing together writers from around the world, bringing together new writers with top professionals, writers from a wide variety of different cultural worlds: literary fiction, SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres; the commercial publishing world & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big presses and the small and the selfpublished; artists, architects, sociologists, medical researchers, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a broad array of the immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much wider range of texts, genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals in this field, reflective of the less hierarchical, less traditionbound culture of Los Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence, literature & criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance, diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world. Our pieces are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications in Brazil, Germany & elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working toward sustainability, increasing our income significantly. ","We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our 100s of contributing editors, the majority of whom are L.A.based. We are collaborating with our readers, whose comments are an increasingly important part of the site. We collaborate with a number of local arts and culture institutions, including the L.A. Public Library, KCRW, KCET, Broad Stage, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, USC, CalArts, UCHRI, Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities, LiveTalksLA, and PEN USA. We collaborate with publications, universities, and literary groups around the country, cosponsoring events, doing crosspromotion on our sites and in social media. We have also started to work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo Pat Brown Charter H.S.","There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in L.A., we now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading almost a half million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for the next two years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in this area. (2) We will measure the diversity of our contributors. We successfully attracted a wider range of writers & reviewers than any of the other most important reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey of womenâ€™s participation in book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are better, sometimes by a factor of two or three, than all the major outlets except the Womenâ€™s Review of Books. But we want to have much more robust representation of African American, Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and other communities. We would measure our success by the rise in those numbers. (3) We will monitor our influence. Already we see publishers featuring our reviews on book covers and in advertisements, and see references to our pieces in NY Times, New Yorker, Slate, Salon, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To see that increase would be a measure of our ability to impact the national cultural conversation, as would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and mentioned in other highlyranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by the support we receive. Our success so far has been made possible by peopleâ€™s willingness to support the project financially (as well as by their willingness to volunteer their time as editors, & by their willingness to donate their writing or write for a very nominal sum). Our success going forward can be measured by the willingness of people to financially support our project, making the other two less necessary. We have roughly doubled our contributions from our 1st year to our 2nd, & we would like to double again this year and next. We are starting a membership program, & the level of participation in the program will be an important measure of our success, as will the total dollars raised. (5) We will measure our success in terms of the support we can give to others. We believe strongly that writers should get paid for their work, & aim to help to reverse the damage done to writersâ€™ livelihood by the decline of print periodicals. We will consider it a major success if we raise enough through gifts, grants, & auxiliary income to pay writers the rates that print book reviews have traditionally paid. We also would measure our success by whether we can expand our outreach in community programming & educational services. We hope to produce more in the way of radio programming, for instance, to bring our curriculum project to more schools, & to bring the intensive editing workshops we provide our interns to other high school, college students & recent graduates. If we are serving a broad range of L.A. communities we will consider ourselves a success.","LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of its concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested in culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to participate in.  Our presence in local media, as in our current collaboration with KCRW and our work with KCET in development, will help more people become engaged with the literary, artistic, and intellectual life of the city.  Our public programming, like our current collaborations with The Broad Stage, LiveTalksLA, and LAPLâ€™s ALOUD series, will continue to increase in breadth and frequency, bringing a series of newly conceived, multigenre performances to a variety of audiences, building on the work being done on our website. And, in turn, our national and global presence will help bring readers elsewhere an appreciation for L.A.â€™s contributions to culture; that is, we will post podcasts and video digests of these events on our website and our YouTube channel.  Our public programming will enhance the offerings the city already has, and our partnerships with the arts and culture organizations listed below, along with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help integrate our famously fragmented city.  We bring the most recondite and specialized research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges and make it accessible to anyone in the city.  By placing the writers in the worlds of film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre writers, the academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we build bridges among tribes that have long kept their distance from one another, with benefits in all directions.  Our work with high schools will help engage students with culture in many different ways.  We will be a new and vigorous and innovative partner with all of the arts and culture organizations in town in the project of bringing the world to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to the world. We will help recruit, train, and retain the writers and critics required to keep Los Angeles the most important city for arts and culture in the country.","Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural scene. The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers and writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV, film, and new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all fields of the humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups, and across all of the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive, innovative, interactive forum, a ""publication"" that would bridge the academic and popular, the local and the global, and the traditional and the new. LARB will have kept on the cutting edge of any new technologies useful to its mission and its readers. LARB will have helped keep alive the fine arts of editing, proofreading, and factchecking, and will continue training new generations in them. LARB will have developed multiple platforms for use in instruction from the early grades through graduate colleges. The best that is being thought and written and produced in 2050 would be finding its maximum audience. LARB will have established itself as among the very few leading forums for arts and culture in the world. And instead of losing ground, as predicted in the GOOD report, Los Angeles, through the vitality of its literature, arts, and culture, will have increased its ability to enhance human development, both in the city and county, and far beyond."

Redesigning our cities for walkers & walking will help make our cities places where people want to be. But itâ€™s not something we consciously think about. So every time youâ€™re out there walking I want you to think â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€ â€” Alissa Walker, Journalist & Los Angeles Walks Steering Committee member, at WIRED 2012</p>


<p>Last December, Alissaâ€™s talk at the WIRED 2012 conference in London became a dinner table discussion at an LA Walks meeting. We laughed over the clip Alissa referenced from Midnight Cowboy where Dustin Hoffman yells â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€ at a fastmoving car rolling into a New York City crosswalk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c412hqucHKw But in all seriousness, shouting â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Hereâ€ was far too representative of our own LA experienceâ€”a place where walking doesnâ€™t get enough respect. We found ourselves becoming inspired by other entertaining yet educational stunts that highlighted pedestrians, like a group of pedestrians that actually moved a car which had stopped in the middle of the crosswalk in Brazil: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UqhUeDTAyYs Or PeatÃ³nito, who takes to the streets in Mexico City as the masked Mexican defender of pedestrians: http://m.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/02/ifonlyeverycityhadmaskedluchalibredefenderpedestrians/4804/ We realized we needed the same kind of cultural touchstone for LA: a movement bringing attention, safety & a bit of fun to walking to help build a healthier, more vibrant LA.</p>


<p>The benefits of walking reach beyond individual fitness to make communities into healthier places to live, work & play. Walking instead of driving, even for short car trips, decreases air pollution & reduces respiratory & cardiovascular ailments as well as some kinds of cancer. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for Angelenos under the age of 5 & the secondleading cause of death for children & young adults ages 5 to 24. Making the city safer for pedestrians can also make the city more equitable: Most pedestrian deaths in L.A. occur in lowincome neighborhoods where many residents do not own cars.</p>


<p>But the solution is not simply to get more people walkingâ€”it also requires that streets & sidewalks be redesigned to protect pedestrians from roadway traffic, slow down cars & trucks, & keep walkers feeling safe. With these ideas in mind, LA Walks proposes to launch ""Hey, I'm Walking Here!""  (or in EspaÃ±ol, â€œÂ¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!â€)â€”a campaign which will not only increase pedestrian safety, but also highlight & celebrate walking as a conscious act thatâ€™s happening all over the city.  And by expanding upon our existing LA Walks work including awareness, events, community meetings & action, weâ€™ll be able to support longterm efforts to build a more walkable LA by 2050.</p>





<p>Activities funded through our â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€ campaign will include:</p>


<p>1. Creating a bilingual â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€/ â€œÂ¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!â€ publicity campaign using posters, stickers, public art, infographics & social media.</p>


<p>2. Authoring â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€/ â€œÂ¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!â€ materials which will highlight the benefits of walking as a healthy & civicminded action.</p>


<p>3. Convening community meetings in three neighborhoods where residents will assess the â€œgood, bad & the uglyâ€ for pedestrian activity, highlighting unsafe or unsavory walking environments to improve on the â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Hereâ€ action days.</p>


<p>4. Organizing â€œHey Iâ€™m Walking Hereâ€ action days where local communities will be empowered to make temporary, attentiongetting improvements to local walking infrastructure (like a Parking Day focused on pedestrians).</p>


<p>5. Designing a pilot program for a pedestrianfocused, smartphonecompatible urban wayfinding system that also serves as a publicity campaign throughout the city, to help Angelenos to understand the distance between neighborhoods & landmarks, & see that more places are walkable.</p>


<p>6. Holding regular group walks to underscore how walking is a fun way to explore the city & promote healthy lifestyles, where we will provide â€œHey Iâ€™m Walking Hereâ€ materials.</p>


<p>7. Promoting pedestrian parades & events during CicLAvias (WalkLAvia) to make sure walkers have a  welcoming space when streets are closed to traffic.</p>


<p>8. Educating local residents about how to ask for highervisibility crosswalks & lower speed limits on their streets (especially near schools).</p>


<p>9. Building partnerships & coalitions with organizations interested in public health, transportation, urban design, sustainability, equity & more.</p>


<p>10. Increasing advocacy efforts with elected officials & decisionmakers to make LA more walkable, including addressing design & maintenance of sidewalks.</p>


<p>11. Sending action alerts to the growing list of walking activists when there are opportunities to improve safety.</p>","<p>Deborah Murphy, a native Angeleno, founded Los Angeles Walks in 1998 after a key appointment as the Chair of the City of Los Angeles Pedestrian Advisory Committee, which she continues to hold today. Deborah has consistently worked to bring attention to the act of walking in the city of Los Angeles as a way to build a healthier, more livable city. For 15 years, Los Angeles Walks has been the goto organization for the press regarding pedestrian safety issues, appearing in media including KCRW, KCET, KPCC, LA Times, LA Weekly, Curbed LA, Streetsblog LA, LAist, Atlantic Cities and more.  </p>





<p>Starting in the fall of 2011, Alexis Lantz, Jessica Meaney, Colleen Corcoran and Alissa Walker joined Deborah under the fiscal umbrella of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition to launch a major grassroots efforts to increase awareness of walking in L.A. In 2012 the group expanded even more, adding My La, Karen Mack, Mark Vallianatos, Daveed Kapoor and Tilza Castillo to the Steering Committee.</p>





<p>Key accomplishments include:</p>





<p> Advocated for the Cityâ€™s first Walkability Checklist that is used by City Planning Staff in their review of new development projects</p>


<p> Organized the Great Hollywood Walkabout in 2006</p>


<p> Organized the Great Glassell Park/Cypress Park Walkabout in 2007</p>


<p> Organized the Downtown Pasadena Walkabout in 2008</p>


<p> Part of the team that prepared the Nationally recognized Living Street Model Street Design Manual in 2011</p>


<p> Part of the Green LA Coalition Living Streets Campaign</p>


<p> Served on County of Los Angeles Pedestrian Safety Task Force


<p> Advocated for 15 years for Continental Crosswalk installations in the City of Los Angeles</p>


<p> Advocated for 20 years for the creation of the Pedestrian Coordinator positions, which were finally created in 2012</p>


<p> Advocated with a coalition of Active Transportation advocates for a 5% setaside of Measure R Local Return funds for pedestrian projects and 5% for bicycle projects in the City of Los Angeles</p>


<p> Advocated for pedestrian and bike safety projects in Silver Lake including a Road Diet for Rowena Avenue for six years, which was implemented in 2013</p>


<p> Facilitated pedestrian safety charrettes in two Los Angeles neighborhoods: Silver Lake community in August 2012 and Leimert Park in November 2012</p>


<p> Conducted pedestrianrelated events during CicLAvia including a WalkLAvia in October 2012 on three miles of Figueroa Street</p>","Multicultural Communities for Mobility, Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition,Occidental College Urban and Environmental Policy Institute, Safe Routes to School National Partnership, Los Angeles Commons, Streetsblog Los Angeles, Colleen Corcoran, Designed by Colleen, Project Food LA","<p>We will evaluate the campaignâ€™s success in the short term by demonstrating that walking is top of mind for Angelenos. Over the long term the campaign will measure several other metrics related to walking, like an increase in the number of Angelenos who walk, an increase in the amount of spending on pedestrian infrastructure, the addition of walkable land uses, and improved health for Angelenos.</p>





<p>We will track the number of events and community forums that Los Angeles Walks holds and the number of participants in these events to see how many people weâ€™re reaching through our message. Weâ€™ll also administer surveys at these events to see if our campaign changed the way people felt about walking.</p>





<p>We will capture and quantify the different ways that the campaign shares its â€œHey, Iâ€™m Walking Here!â€ message, and count how often campaign slogans and themes are picked up and references in news articles and interviews, likeminded organizations, social media likes and shares, political and policy debates and other public forums.</p>





<p>We will also use data collection to measure an increase in pedestrian activity. Los Angeles Walks plans to participate in the Fall 2013 City of Los Angeles Bicycle and Pedestrian Count led by the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, which helps establish muchneeded data about how many people are walking and provides a better understanding of current travel patterns in the city.</p>





<p>We will track local and online sentiment for walking and pedestrian advocacy. Los Angeles Walks blogs regularly with updates on upcoming pedestrianrelated events and news and produces a yearinwalking roundup of highlights. Comparing past updates to next yearâ€™s yearinwalking report can help show whether there is an upsurge in interest in walking in L.A.</p>





<p>We will work with local public health organizations to learn if more Angelenos are walking for exercise or for transportation, and compare this to health data from previous years to see if walking is making an impact in the overall health of the city.</p>





<p>As we track the strength of our messaging and participate in data collection, we will be laying the groundwork for analyzing longer term improvements in walkingrelated indicators. We will collect baseline data for rates of walking, funding for pedestrian programs and infrastructure, injuries and fatalities to pedestrians, staffing for pedestrian programs, and land zoned for mixed uses and/or with pedestrian overlays.</p>





<p>We plan to work closely alongside existing community efforts, reaching thought leaders, policymakers, and media to help us outline key steps which will not only build safer and more accessible city, but a more fun place to walk as well.</p>","As the most common type of physical activity, walking is an easy and effective way to improve fitness. It reduces body fat and bad cholesterol, cutting the risk of some of the leading causes of death in Los Angeles. Walking extends lifeâ€”walking 75 minutes per week adds 1.8 years of life; walking 2.5 hours per week adds 7 years of life. Walking regularly also improves mood and reduces fatigue.





And these health benefits can also lead to larger social change. Walking increases our contact with our neighbors, builds social capital and civic awareness and puts more eyes on the street to reduce crime. In a city like L.A. with a diverse population but a history of social inequality and residential segregation, walking also allows people to explore new neighborhoods and can help reduce barriers of class, race, language and location.





Walking also brings significant economic benefits. In other cities, studies show that streets that have received pedestrian improvements such as street porches, pedestrian plazas and traffic calming have often found a boost in sales. Property values are also higher in walkable neighborhoods than in comparable sprawling places. As living in a walkable area becomes more desirable, walkable cities have an easier time attracting businesses and people with ideas for starting new businesses.





Despite what some â€˜80s pop songs might say, Los Angeles has incredible potential to become one of the worldâ€™s most walkable cities. Even our reputation for sprawl works to our advantage: Los Angeles developed as a series of of neighborhoods connected by an interurban rail system, meaning that there are multiple historic downtowns and commercial corridors that provide interesting places to walk. We also have the fastestgrowing transit system in the United States, a â€œwalk extenderâ€ because it allows people to walk to a bus or train, take transit, then continue walking to destinations.





A pedestrian advocacy movement is overdue in Los Angeles, yet the timing could not be better. The City has not addressed the funding and maintenance of its sidewalks in a comprehensive manner since the 1970s, but there is growing interest from the City and residents to change this. In the Fall of 2012, the City of Los Angeles hired its firstever pedestrian staff as a result of leadership and advocacy from groups such as Los Angeles Walks. Walking events like the Great Los Angeles Walk, Big Parade and Secret Stairs have steadily increased in numbers over the last few years. And in the past year the local press have covered more walkingrelated stories, from Christopher Hawthorneâ€™s recent series on L.A. boulevards in the Los Angeles Times to the LA Weeklyâ€™s focus on hitandrun collisions.





In a city where less than 20% of all trips are taken on foot or bike, we believe that even a small increase in awareness around the benefits of walking will have a dramatic impact across the city. We believe our campaign is perfectly timed to build upon this momentum.","<p>By 2050, Los Angeles will be known globally as one of the best cities for walking in the world. The biggest change can be easily seen from the air: All of L.A.â€™s oncefamous freeways have been removed or capped with parks, their multiple lanes of traffic replaced with extensive linear parks. Down the center of each of these parks are wide bus boulevards, protected cycling lanes and excellent walking paths. This network of â€œurban trailsâ€ connects each of L.A.â€™s neighborhoods so itâ€™s completely possible to get nearly anywhere in the city on dedicated foot or bike infrastructure, although the comprehensive rail system (once again the largest in the country) is usually faster.  </p>





<p>The other notable transformation can be seen at the neighborhood level. A cultural shift has occurred throughout the city and Angelenos in general choose to live close to where they work or cowork, with more than half of Angelenos working from home. When they need to visit other parts of the city to shop, eat or play, people generally walk or bike to a rail station or a bus boulevard, where they can catch a train or the frequent, convenient, attractive zeroemissions buses which are the main form of motorized transportation in 2050. Education has improved as well, with 90% of kids walking or biking to school as they attend quality schools close to where they live. Although cars are still legal, driving is not efficient since all roads have tolls, surface parking lots are banned, and speed limits are 15 m.p.h. in residential neighborhoods. Most people donâ€™t own cars, and those who do usually only drive them as a hobby, since theyâ€™re relics of a bygone era.</p>





<p>But perhaps the most important change to the city in 2050 is that the health of its residents has dramatically improved since the early 2000â€™s. Most Angelenos naturally take the Surgeon Generalâ€™s recommended minimum 10,000 steps a day, so Angelenos live longer and enjoy healthier lives. The percentage of trips in Los Angeles taken on foot, bike or transit will have increased from 20 percent to 95 percent. These shift into trips taken on foot result in better air quality, reduced carbon emissions, and improved public health. Rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory illness are significantly lower. Plus collision rates for pedestrians have been reduced to practically zero.</p>





<p>Because all neighborhoods are good places to walk, health disparities between ethnic groups and different parts of the city have been dramatically reduced. Families with children can live nearly anywhere in the city and be connected to their community. More importantly, our growing population can move to dense parts of the city to age in place without a loss of independence.</p>"
3102167,2013167,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Communitybuilding.html,Los Angeles Youth Orchestra Community Building, Education,"The Los Angles Youth Orchestra (LAYO) gives children 818 who play orchestral instruments the opportunity to practice and perform in an orchestra on a regular basis.  We draw students from all over Los Angeles and create a cohesive musical community in eight to ten weeks. Each semester culminates in two performances in two different locations.  LAYO would like to expand participation in the orchestra through community building and outreach.  We envision an orchestra that educates a larger portion of Los Angelesâ€™s students.  The 2050 funding will help us achieve this goal by funding teacher salaries, scholarships, and community outreach through student recruitment and  free concerts.  





The future for education in the Goldhirsch report is grim; the future of arts education is worse.  The first programs to get cut in most school districts are the art programs.  The largest school district in Los Angeles has gutted funding for arts education, and music was the first to go.  Fewer than 10% of Los Angeles Unified School Districtâ€™s students receive instruction in the arts and no elementary or middle school has an instrument program.   Research shows playing an instrument positively affects educational outcomes.  Children who play a musical instrument are more likely to finish high school and go on to college.  They perform better in math and science, and have an easier time learning languages. LAYO Impacts the city through itâ€™s students and concerts.  LAYO students excel both musically and academically.  A 100% of our participants graduate high school and the majority move onto college.


An educated and engaged population keeps the city economically and culturally vital. 





The Los Angeles Youth Orchestra orchestra started with ten kids and has grown to 80.   It brings a very diverse group of students together to practice an under funded art form. The Orchestra has been in existence for thirteen years.  In those thirteen years we have had thousands of students learn and perform orchestral music and have reached tens of thousands of people through our concerts. We bring students from all over Los Angeles County together to practice and perform orchestral music on Sunday afternoon from 12:005:00 pm.  LAYO is comprised of two orchestras the Concert (intermediate) and Chamber (advanced).    The success of our program is based on our mentorship model, each section has itâ€™s own section rehearsal which enables our students to perform concerts in a relatively short time period.  The goal of the orchestra is not to produce professional musicians but to create and foster a supportive community for children who love and practice classical music.","Concert at Carnegie Hall: February 2013


Partnership with the Los Angeles Film Festival: June 2012


Youth Orchestra Day: In February of 2010


Partnership with the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music: In 2008.

","The Los Angeles County Arts Commission, Audiomachine .","Our project will be evaluated by new student participation and retention, audience growth and increased scholarship requests.  Success will be measured by both adding new students and having those new students continue for multiple years.  We will track both retention and scholarship requests from this project along with ticket acquisition.  Our current ticket allocation program will be used to track our audience numbers.","Our project directly impacts the future of Los Angeles through our students. Our students directly impact the greater community through our concerts.  LAYO students are proof that playing an instrument and participating in an ensemble positively affects academic success. 100% of our participants graduate high school and most go onto college. 


The Los Angeles Youth Orchestra positively impacts the community through our audience.  People who attend our concerts can't help but share the joy and enthusiasm our musicians demonstrate while performing.   This positively impacts the cultural vitality of our city through the participation and support of the arts. 





",Education would be more fluid; Los Angeles students would be given a rich curriculum that would include experiential arts education. Los Angeles student's would be offered instrumental lessons and orchestral opportunities starting in elementary school and continuing through high school. Both school based and independently run youth orchestras would have ample funding.
3102168,2013168,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LTSC.html,ReConnecting L.A. Neighborhoods through Music & History, Social Connectedness,"The ongoing development of LAâ€™s light rail network is one of the cityâ€™s largest transportation investments since the construction of the original freeway system and will undoubtedly shape the future of LA.  Then as now, this construction is happening in the middle of existing neighborhoods, providing new opportunities while threatening the social fabric of established communities.<br/><br/>


LA Metro is about to start construction of the Little Tokyo/Arts District Regional Connector Station, starting with demolishing all buildings at the southeast corner of 1st/Central.  One of these buildings, now home to Senor Fish restaurant, previously housed Atomic Cafe and the Troy Cafe, which were for decades significant cultural and social anchors for Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and the Arts District. While the light rail network physically connects LAâ€™s neighborhoods, we have a short window of opportunity to shed light on a little known part of LAâ€™s history and create human connections that will last for generations.<br/><br/>








This project proposes a creative placemaking project centered around the station, slated to begin construction at the beginning of 2014.  We propose 2 interconnected projects: (1) the launching of a campaign to create a permanent art installation in remembrance of the vibrant and historic LA music scene of the Atomic CafÃ©, Troy CafÃ©, and the Arts District with a kickoff celebration in Fall of 2013; and (2) a campaign to preserve the original building, scheduled for demolition by Metro, that housed both the Atomic CafÃ© and Troy CafÃ©, and served as a common meeting space for artists from Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and the Arts District in the â€˜80s and â€˜90s. <br/><br/>








The Little Tokyo/Arts District station site is an important, but relatively unknown, marker in the history of Los Angelesâ€™ music community.  The Atomic CafÃ©, a longtime local Japanese neighborhood restaurant, was transformed in the early 1980s into one of the Cityâ€™s hottest gathering spots for the burgeoning punk rock scene.  Bands from across the nation and even from overseas could be found hanging out with the locals afterhours on a regular basis.  According to its owner, Blondie, The GoGos, X, David Byrne, and David Bowie were among the CafÃ©â€™s patrons.  Although the Atomic CafÃ© closed in the late â€˜80s, the space maintained its artistic and musical spirit as the Troy CafÃ© in the â€˜90s, hosting a vibrant Chicano music scene and serving as a critical venue for Boyle Heights and Eastside community musicians.  Nearby, in the LA Arts District, places such as Alâ€™s Bar stood for many years as another focal point and launchpad for local artists and musicians emerging from the underground scene to national and international prominence.  <br/><br/>








Our first project is to launch a campaign for a permanent art installation to capture this rich history by (a) gathering stories through oneonone interviews, (b) creating an interactive platform for all Angelenos with a connection to these venues to share their stories, and (c) celebrating this movement with a live program in the fall of 2013.<br/><br/>








Our second project is a campaign to preserve and relocate all or part of the original Atomic Cafe building located at the station site.  When completed, the Little Tokyo/Arts District RCS will be one of the busiest transit hubs for Metroâ€™s light rail station, providing access to 90,000 passengers every day and attracting visitors, investors, and developers to Little Tokyo and the Arts District.  However, the station will eliminate this cultural gem and clear away a rich history. Instead, we want to preserve it future generations.  In the face of this imminent loss, we will knit together three neighborhoods  Little Tokyo, the Arts District, and Boyle Heights  with all Angelenos in a celebration of music, culture, and history.  We will work with historic preservation, engineering, and design consultants on a preservation and relocation solution.  Metro requires that the building be relocated by the end of 2013, otherwise it will be demolished taking with it this piece of Los Angelesâ€™ history. We hope to catalyze a local and regional scale social connectivity that will last for generations of Angelenos to come.<br/><br/>


","For over 30 years LTSC has been serving the Japanese/Japanese American community in the Greater Los Angeles area as the only regional provider of bilingual and bicultural social services.  LTSC reaches 18,000 people each year. A significant proportion of our clients come to us from the broader Japanese/Japanese American community members who seek services such as child abuse prevention, consumer education, senior services, case management, individual and family counseling, and cultural education for children and youth.


<br/><br/>


As part of our community development work, LTSC has made significant efforts to revitalize Little Tokyo into a vibrant community. LTSC has worked in partnership with other entities to designate a major portion of Little Tokyo as a National Historic Landmark. LTSC has renovated and upgraded three buildings in the historic district:<br/><br/>





*San Pedro Firm Building.   This 1923 building was threatened with demolition by the City but quick action by LTSC and community advocates saved the building.  After a $3 million renovation, it now provides 42 units of safe, clean, affordable housing to lowincome seniors and other residents, and commercial space to longstanding and new small businesses.    <br/><br/>





*Old Union Church Building.   Immediately nextdoor to the San Pedro Firm Building is the historic Old Union Church, one of the earliest Japanese American Christian church structures built in Los Angeles. In the 1970â€™s, the church congregation relocated and the aging building suffered in the ensuing years from neglect.  Again LTSC led the effort to raise $4 million to bring this building back to life and now this once abandoned space is The Union Center for the Arts.








*The Historic Far East Building with its famous Far East CafÃ© is located in the heart of the Little Tokyo Historic District, bearing witness to the birth, growth and development of what was, during its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, the largest Japanese American community in the mainland United States. After suffering severe damage during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the buildingâ€™s future was uncertain, possibly taking with it all of its history. LTSC was able to save the building to keep this part of Little Tokyoâ€™s history alive. 





*Casa Heiwa. Additionally, in 1996 LTSC completed the first new familyoriented housing project to be built in Little Tokyo in over 70 years. 





Through LTSCâ€™s community organizing efforts we have established relationships with Little Tokyo residents and have taught them to collectively and formally represent their concerns. Moreover, we have worked with residents to develop a model for community involvement in planning. With our support and guidance, the residents have lobbied for two crosswalks, a post office and helped successfully fight to preserve affordable housing at a 100unit building. They have also lobbied against a proposed 500bed jail and have fought to limit bail bonds businesses in the area.","This project will involve partners from the Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, and Arts District neighborhoods.  We will collaborate with local artists, musicians, residents, and stakeholders of these neighborhoods.  Finally, we will invite all Angelenos to share their memories and experiences of these neighborhoods and arts venues via an interactive platform.


","We will measure success by a number of different metrics.  First, successfully preserving at least some portion of the former Atomic CafÃ© and Troy CafÃ© building must occur by the end of 2013 to meet Metroâ€™s strict construction schedule.  The preservation of the physical edifice would symbolize the preservation of our combined history and culture.  Second, we will measure success in the number of stories gathered by interviews.  Third, we will be successful if we establish our interactive platform and we gain participation from Angelenos. Finally, we will measure attendance of the live program and the number of individuals and organizations that â€œbuyinâ€ to our movement.





","This project benefits not just the local neighborhoods and communities adjacent to the Regional Connector Station, but all of Los Angeles.  Los Angeles has many hidden historic and cultural gems tucked away in a myriad corners of the Cityâ€™s rich tapestry, created and destroyed over many iterations of land development over the decades.  Our project sets to proactively preserve and celebrate this unique chapter in Los Angelesâ€™ artistic and cultural history. <br/><br/>





Without this project, the City  and future generations of Angelenos  will lose out on the opportunity to permanently memorialize the significance of this site and the incredible story of bringing communities together through music and art.   Our project strives to engage not only artists, but the entire city in our activities by inviting Angelenos to share their connections with the site and to join in the celebration of this story at a launch concert or program in the fall.  Even though our project will be completed in 2013, it will touch generations of train riders who embark and disembark at this station  connecting them to Los Angelesâ€™ vibrant past and inspiring them to explore the communities around them.","In 2050, Angelenos are connected to each other.  We are connected physically by the expansion of our transit system that allows us to access and discover the rich breadth of neighborhoods in Los Angelesneighborhoods like Little Tokyo and the Arts District. But these physical connections will also connect us to our history in meaningful and engaging ways. We can disembark at a train station and learn about a Los Angeles from a previous era.  A resident from the west side will connect with someone from Boyle Heights, or Little Tokyo and share a human connection.  The Arts District will still be a place for artists and musicians to congregate, share their art with the world, and live and work alongside each other. The city would be crisscrossed with resonant social connections across neighborhood lines, racial and ethnic lines, class lines, into a living, breathing mosaic."
3102169,2013169,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/OPENHEALTHCentral.html,OPENHealth Central  Putting the care back in healthcare, Health,"OPENHealth Central: a software service that helps clinics manage the care of patients with complex cases, thus increasing access, improving care, and driving down costs in a systematic and scalable fashion








The Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that wonâ€™t automatically translate into better care. 








Given the geographic, economic, and social disparities here, meeting the needs of our residents is a huge challenge. After all, L.A. County's healthcare systems serve more people than any other place in America. When the newly insured enter the system, experts agree they will bring with them significant health needs and social circumstances that will make it especially difficult to take full advantage of healthcare services. This population is often treated at clinics where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to facetoface services only. On top of that, a shortage of primarycare doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help patients achieve optimal health. 








Fortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to cultivate innovative solutions that enhance the healthy connections between clinics and the populations they serve, and which will forge partnerships with the power to systematically improve care for everyone in Los Angeles. 








While there are many promising political, economic, and social initiatives underway to create a more equitable and effective healthcare system in the county, we cannot allow the connection between healthcare providers and their patients to be the weak link. Specifically, primary care practices are already struggling to serve people with complex chronic conditions in proactive, comprehensive, and effect ways, and if they don't have the tools to rise to the occasion, access to care will matter little. 








Among the most promising advances in clinical care is the emergence of physicianled interdisciplinary ""care teams"" that flesh out the ""medical home"" approach to managing patient populations. Care teams of communitybased healthcare workers complement the expertise of MDs in ways that address the physician shortage while improving care and driving down costs.  These teams permit a more comprehensive approach to patient needs while boosting the number of patients a practice can manage. 








But how can Los Angeles increase the effectiveness of care teams at scale, thus expanding access to highvalue care as the patient population expands?








We believe that Lybba's OPENHealth Central is a fundamental pathway toward a healthier L.A. in 2050. OPENHealth Central is a web and mobilebased system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic conditions, while prompting patients to collect the kinds of information between visits that can dramatically improve their care and the system as a whole. 








OPENHealth Central is an opensource software service whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. It helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and selfcare, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system triggers action on the part of doctors, while also collecting data that drives evidencebased improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.








OPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. 


Beyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and achieve health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions.  


 











OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:





â€¢	screen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care 





â€¢	communicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving the time and expense associated with facetoface clinical encounters





â€¢	support individualized preventive, chronic, and acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible





â€¢	develop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are datadriven and accountable





â€¢	increase patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm handoffs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their healthrelated needs





â€¢	help ensure clinical quality data is shareable within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics





OPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their careproviders lead more healthy and satisfying lives","OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Los Angeles that designs networks, tools, and events that help people better care for themselves and one another. We design networks of patients, physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough solutions.








Over the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) 








Lybba is currently designing and building an automated decisionsupport aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this software product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major L.A. research medical center.)








Lybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, researchers, and physicians, along with genetic information, to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California lifesciences company.)








Lybba designed a knowledge base of medical diagnostics, including  knowledgesharing models for how potential contributorssuch as MDs, patients, organizations, and otherswill participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques. (Supported by The California Endowment.)








Lybba is a codesigner of the Regional Resource Network of quality improvement leaders throughout the country. With the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, we are devising prototypes that will make it easier for people to develop, curate, and spread knowledge. (Supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.)








Lybba conceived of and created an immersive DIY biodesign event for high school science classrooms in partnership with The California Endowment and their Building Healthy Community initiative in South L.A. Biohackathon L.A. 2013 focused on career opportunities in the life sciences and the crossapplication of biotech knowledge. (Supported by the California Biotechnology Foundation.)


 





In addition to the programs above, Lybba has designed, constructed, and created content strategy for a dozen healthcare websites. Lybba has also produced two dozen films on science and healthcare with our filmmaking partner, Wondros. 





 


","OPENHealth Central will be built in an opensource fashion, relying on multiple software and data providers to achieve rapid, widespread transformation of healthcare for the public good. 








Brian Prestwich, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Family Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, serves as Medical Director for OPENHealth Central. We also have the support of Libby Hoy, founder Patient & Family Centered Care Partners, which contribute knowledge, insight, as well as a testbed for the OPENHealth Central. PFCC Partners is committed to building a community of health care providers, administrators, patients, and families to improve the quality, safety, experience and delivery of health care. 


","OPENHealth Central, at its core, is a data system that tracks the quality of the care experience, the care process itself, costs, and outcomes. It will provide much needed information to practice leaders and policymakers so that funds can flow where they will be of greatest value. 








The Recovery Act (â€œMeaningful Useâ€) and the Affordable Care Act are leading patients, payers, purchasers, and the clinical leaders to demand information that sheds light on the true value of healthcare services. This historical alignment of payment for value has the potential to fuel the improvement of healthcare delivery in the U.S., but only if new metrics and methods are created to define value for all involved.








OPENHealth Central is designed to help provide better means to manage care, particularly at clinics in underserved communities and for patients with complex chronic diseases and their attendant comorbidities. Costs associated with caring for these populations are staggering, and OPENHealth Central will provide the means for clinics in these communities to screen, care for, monitor, and collect evidence about these populations. This evidencebased model has the potential for creating the conditions for systemic change, particularly when such a software service is adopted by clinical care teams around Los Angeles using similar means for collecting and analyzing data about individual patients and whole populations.








Use of this and other systems across Los Angeles lays the groundwork for methodical multisite clinical qualityimprovement initiatives that can help healthcare providers demonstrate that their care is working and why. Such data will better satisfy the information needs of communities, private insurers, Medicare/Medicaid, and communityhealth researchers.  








Finally, OPENHealth Central will promote transparent and appropriate datagovernance mechanisms that will ensure fairness, openness, data sharing and hence a more level playing field for lesspowerful players in multistakeholder projects such as this.





","The personal, community, and healthcare costs associated with treating chronic illness are crippling Los Angeles; the costs associated with not treating such cases are even greater. The influx of newly insured people in Los Angeles is taxing an already burdened system, because a significant number of these families have serious untreated illnesses and challenging social barriers to negotiate. New strategies must be adopted now if we are to make headway by 2050.








OPENHealth Central is designed to help clinics better plan and coordinate the inhome and clinical care of patients with chronic illnesses before their conditions grow serious, complex, and expensive. Baked into the shape and purpose of OPENHealth Central is a datacollection regime that aids clinics in improving quality of care and reducing costs. In addition to directly benefitting the patients and clinics using OPENHealth Central, these data will help identify which 'needles' to move across Los Angeles, helping to determine what is achieving positive results, and sharing those insights broadly. 








These data, in turn, will provide policymakers and clinical practice leaders the information they need to channel resources where they are most needed. 








L.A.'s current safetynet approach to healthcare (like the rest of the state's) is limited to facetoface strategies, emphasizing the volume of medical encounters over the value of medical attention. This must change if we are to improve outcomes while decreasing percapita healthcare costs. OPENHealth Central is designed to increase the volume and value of care encounters while driving down costs, in part by providing digital tools that make it easier to make care decisions more accurately and swiftly. 








Communityoriented care organizations (such Lybba's collaborator, Family & Parent Centered Care Partners,) strive to achieve the IHI Triple Aim of improved patient experience and care processes, improved outcomes, and better cost controls. But these organizations lack the computational infrastructure to make methodical and swift progress. Without data and the IT infrastructure to direct care resources optimally, even the most dedicated physicians and their care teams have difficulty discriminating between effective and ineffective care strategies. The business model for OPENHealth Central is centered around providing that infrastructure at low cost to clinical practices that would otherwise be unable to build their own.








The good news is that people actually will take better care for themselves and one another, especially when they have continuous, personal relationships with healthcare providers who know their case well and can help them achieve lifestyle and wellness objectives. Primary care practices in underserved communities are best positioned to be partners with these individuals, provided they have the tools they need to manage the care of their population.


","The healthcare system of Los Angeles in 2050 can keep people informed, connected, and ideally out of the hospital via a continuous care model that saves time, money, and lives. It can provide careproviders better ways to connect with their patients and each another, enabling more continuous and symmetrical flows of information. 








Currently, only half the U.S. population with chronic illness receives the care they need, and only half of those patients successfully follow the wellness plans provided by their physicians. Depression, diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and other prevalent chronic ailments can quickly escalate without screening, monitoring, and timely intervention.  With so much data being produced by and on behalf of patients, systems will emerge to offer a more continuous model of care and that reinforces best practices and collaboration between patients and their careproviders. 





By 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can serve the essential needs of the vast number of people who are currently illserved by the current system. Those with the greatest need will get the attention they require because data systems will show that the benefits of holding back services are insignificant compared with the benefits of allocating resources evenly across the county. 





By 2050 residents will have the information they need to care for themselves and one another. They will have the knowledge and means to keep themselves healthy, and they will know when there is no other choice but it seek medical attention. And they will get the attention they need at a fair price.





By 2050 clinical practices will be sharing information about how their patient populations are doing so that optimal care is evenly distributed throughout Los Angeles regardless of social status or geographic location. Primary care practices will be less dependent on MDs and less oriented toward managing bills sent to dozens of 'payers', and more centered around care teams led by physicians oriented around the needs of their patients.





These qualities will come to life because we will have used our knowhow, passion, and community assets to create resilient networks of people, information, and resources focused around the needs of all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies. 








Just as important, these systems will convert data into care insights and meaningful action, helping to ensure that patients have access to and control over their own health information. Los Angeles in 2050 will be driven by its residents not just because laws such as HIPPA say that they have a right to their data, but because systems have emerged to help us use our data to improve our own care and the care of the entire  population.





	





With the adoption of systems like OPENHealth Central, more meaningful relationships between doctors and patients will be possible. "
3102170,2013170,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/machineproject.html,Everything Everywhere: LA 2050,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>OUR IDEA: Los Angeles is exploding with diverse creative talent and sites for cultural production and we believe that anything is possible here. Furthermore we believe that the most interesting ideas emerge from outside our traditional educational and cultural institutions.  Our project Everything, Everywhere helps to explore the cityâ€™s full creative potential by providing artists and art organizers with the logistical and organizational support to create temporary or semipermanent arts spaces in ten communities across greater Los Angeles.  By helping artists and communities redefine and experiment with sites of cultural production we can question how we want culture to look and function in our city.  Our goal for 2050 is to develop visionary models of local cultural production in a diverse set of communities.  Together letâ€™s create the cultural spaces and grassroots organizers of tomorrow.</p>





<p>Everything, Everywhere is based on three basic principles:


 <p>


â€¢	Every Angelino has the power to create and reimagine culture in our city 


 <p>


â€¢	Artists can act as a catalyst for interaction within a community


 <p>


â€¢	Any location has the potential to be transformed into a site of creative use and civic discourse


</p>


    <p>HOW WE WILL DO IT:</p>





<p>1. Selective application process</p>


<p>To implement Everything, Everywhere first Machine Project will publicize an open call for applications. We will accept applications from artists, collectives, community leaders, and small organizations throughout Los Angeles. Successful applicants will propose visionary activity that reflects their community. We expect a wide range of proposals from oneday outdoor tours, to temporarily transforming unused public spaces for cultural use, to converting private space into public forums, to establishing a more permanent artistrun center.  </p>





<p>2. Intensive project training and development</p>


<p>Our process will draw from both our informal grassroots education and institutional collaboration models. We will select a cohort of ten applicants, with special care to capture a wide range of neighborhoods. This cohort will enter a threemonth training program to learn how to conceptualize, create, and manage their projects. The program will be comprised of lectures, site visits, classes, and workshops.  We will assemble a dedicated team to work directly with each cohort member to identify potential locations/venues, build support within their home neighborhoods, produce and document their programming. Machine Project will remain involved in each project through frequent checkins and consultation.  </p>





   <p>HOW IT WILL IMPACT ARTS AND CULTURAL VITALITY: </p> 





<p>Everything, Everywhere will provide visionary ways for the public to experience art throughout Los Angeles County. Because each project will evolve out of a different community we have the potential to discover hundreds of innovative ways to produce and experience culture. </p>





<p>Everything, Everywhere will empower the next generation of artists to create, thrive, and grow in every neighborhood of Los Angeles. By creating connected arts programming across greater Los Angeles we will develop an infrastructure of sustainable art creation and a network of local artists and audiences.  By 2050, we envision hundreds of communityled projects and spaces, each bringing a uniquely local, but highly visible program to their neighborhoods. The artists and audiences will inspire as well as be inspired by their home. </p>





<p>Everything, Everywhere will sidestep cultural production and participation barriers (high cost, transportation, intimidating arts intuitions) by bringing alternative, participationdriven arts spaces to every neighborhood through the innovation of their own local artists. We believe that cultural vitality depends on creating opportunity, support and space for artists to experiment.  Furthermore, we believe that artists should be actively involved in reimagining how these spaces are built and how culture is experienced. </p>","<p>Since 2003, Machine Project has built a national reputation for nurturing innovative, experimental modes of arts engagement by framing challenging arts and educational opportunities as fun, approachable, and occasionally bizarre community events.  And together all of our interrelated activities create active participants in culture where everyone sees themselves as producers and every place as a site for cultural exchange. Our most important achievements to date include:<p>


<p>


â€¢	Hosted over 1,000 free events on everything from lectures on the sex life of sea slugs, buttermaking aerobics, poetry readings, and mindreading workshops. <p>


â€¢	Changed how museums relate to their publics.  In the past 4 years we have partnered with major cultural institutions (LACMA, Hammer Museum, Walker Art Center) to develop and execute a replicable model for how artists and small organizations can work with larger institutions to break down participation barriers.<p>


â€¢	Supported the creation of new work by hundreds of artists.  This includes direct financial support, often presenting their first solo show or first museum show and providing professional video documentation of their work.  <p>","At its core Everything, Everywhere creates a collaborative framework for visionary artists and groups to partner with other artists, organizations and communities.  Our primary partners will be the ten cohort members, however there are endless possible collaborations to be discovered once each project is underway."," <p>Community outreach is critical to this endeavor.  We will evaluate the community participation, in terms of attendance and interaction, of each project to determine the neighborhood and cultural impact. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation will be integrated into each project as it is developed.  Through regular surveys and interviews, we will evaluate our own implementation and process with hopes towards improvement and replication.  <p>  


 <p>


More broadly, we believe this project is built for success because the programming originates from the community itself â€“ through local artists. Therefore we will evaluate Everything, Everywhere by examining the responsiveness and relevance of the ten projects to each community.  Everything, Everywhere will be successful if the cohorts find other ways to collaborate with artists and neighbors and if the audiences will be inspired to create their own projects and sites. Ultimately the greatest success of this project will be the visionary thinking and reimagining of the place and function of cultural space.  This inquiry will advance the form and develop new modes of cultural production and experience. By 2050, the seeds planted in these ten neighborhoods will have inspired the radical exponential growth of cultural activity.  <p>


","Everything, Everywhere will benefit Los Angeles by:





â€¢	Creating replicable examples of community initiated and supported projects that inspire creativity, participation and experimentation citywide. 


â€¢	Cultivating, strengthening and maintaining Los Angelesâ€™s high percentage of working artists and arts professionals.


â€¢	Providing access and exposure to a diverse range of grassroots cultural production.





"," <p>In 2050, artists will be thriving, supported by their community and by a more flexible, responsive civic infrastructure.  Community members will collaborate on the creation of innovative artworks and projects outside of established commercial, academic, and cultural institutions. And every person â€“ both artist and audience member â€“ will be empowered to develop their creative potential.  Success in 2050 can be examined on artist, participant and organizational level:  <p> 


 <p>


â€¢	Artist support: Artists receive financial support for experimentation through residencies and commissions funded by community and civic organizations that are cocreated by the artists they serve.  <p> 


â€¢	Fewer barriers to participation: Engaging in the arts will no longer be thought of as a onceayear field trip to the intimidating downtown museum, but instead a daily, local, participatory event.  <p>


â€¢	LocalGlobal organizational action: A densely connected web of local creative activity will empower other artists and communities to create their own programming, arts spaces and support models. These models and ideas can then move through the world, adapted by other organizations and communities.  <p>


 


 <p>Taken together  these three levels of success will dramatically enhance human development. Los Angeles is at the forefront of cultural activity, but in order to truly live up to its full creative potential we need to build an infrastructure of locally driven arts participation.  Then we can imagine and ultimately realize a place where it is a civic responsibility to support the arts and that the arts are integrated into everyoneâ€™s daily life.  <p>

3102171,2013171,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/UGLYAPP.html,START SEEING UGLY!  A social app to reveal and transform blighted parts of Los Angeles, Social Connectedness,"START SEEING UGLY! is proposed as a riveting demonstration of how emerging personal technologies and social media canâ€”and most definitely willâ€”become empowering tools for educating, engaging, connecting and organizing those living in community. The result will be a new twist on social connectedness, collective civic action and community empowerment where smartphones are put to use as instruments of social synergy.


<br>


<br>


Materials & Applications (M&A), a 501(c)(3) corporation, proposes to create a set of online social outreach tools under its Urban Applications initiative for just such purposes. START SEEING UGLY! will empower anyone with a Smartphone or digital camera to take photos of physical blight in any community in Los Angeles and upload them to a correlated website database that will â€œpinâ€ the geotagged shots onto a map  creating a hub for social action by community stakeholders. START SEEING UGLY! will both promote and support social connectedness for civic engagement in a breathtaking display of participatory democracy.


<br>


<br>


M&A, as a group of online media developers, artists, architects, ecologists, urban planning students and other volunteers working in artistic fields, is interested in recruiting ordinary citizens in a sustainable campaign to clean up L.A. streets using processes of cocreation. By moving the participating publicâ€”especially young peopleâ€”through a contiguous series of personal and collective commitments, we feel that we can help to transform our cityâ€”and our peopleâ€”in positive ways for the future. Borrowing from an architectural concept, â€œurban acupuncture,â€ in which strategic small scale interventions have radiating effects, we expect to reset the power and energies of local distressed communities, one by one.


<br>


<br>


Building on prior experience in organizing communities to create public art that galvanizes public interest for environmental solutions, we will identify parcels of land that deteriorate the environmental, social and economic health of neighborhoods. Citizens will be invited to document these parcels and add them to the START SEEING UGLY! websitehosted database and mapping system. M&A will then work with community stakeholders to find solutions that are supported by the collective will and resource bank.


<br>


<br>


The first step, CONNECTION, is to encourage local citizens to seeâ€”really seeâ€”the decayed areas that they pass through each day and often ignore. We expect this project and its promotion will pull community stakeholders out of their complacency and into awareness. By having a platform on which to share what they see, participants will have stepped into a first level of personal responsibility for their community.


<br>


<br>


The second step, ANALYSIS, is for M&A and community partners to analyze the sites identified, using matrices that will track the greatest concentrations of photos and reportings, compare and sort them, amass demographic and land parcel data from city and other databases, and, with community input, prioritize them for action based on public interest and urgency. 


<br>


<br>


The third step, TRANSFORMATION, is for M&A and its volunteers to connect to the sources of power who can investigate and negotiate solutionsâ€”City Council, City Planning and Cultural Affairs Departments, other governmental agencies, community organizations, and the private sector. In addition to spurring others to action, M&A will be alert for projects that deal with watershed and other environmental issues that could have a public art component. M&A supports the efficacy of working with community residents to plan and erect monuments to their successes in community engagement. 


<BR>


<br>


For example, M&A is now developing a public art element for a project in Sun Valley spearheaded by the Council for Watershed Health (CWH). CWHâ€™s Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project transformed an underserved urban neighborhood into a urban ecosystem. Phase I of the project employed ecological strategies as well as communityengaged design to transform traditional front yards and a residential street into a system for water harvesting and conserving; climate appropriate landscaping; and recapturing stormwater to replenish groundwater supplies in the Los Angeles River Watershed. In Phase II, residents were engaged in the transformation of a blighted alleyway into a new Paseo, a community pathway integrated with stormwater management improvements.


<br>


<br>


M&A is working with CWH to expand on these efforts by engaging residents, schools and other community stakeholders to explore and interact with the new ecosystem through public art, environmental education, and community engagement. In so doing we are creating a model for building social cohesion and public art around community issues.


<br>


<br>


Our video is the vision of START SEEING UGLY! as a citywide strategy to promote social connectedness and civic action in Los Angeles.","Materials & Applications (M&A), shares and demystifying concepts in art, architecture, and sustainable design in an outdoor courtyard open to the street 24 hours a day. Our projects create collaborative opportunities across disciplines and to explore new projects in public space.  Our primary goal is the advancement of public participation in the built environment by inspiring visitors in their surroundings  while they explore the latest ideas in architectural design and theory on an experiential level. We push the application of materials beyond the limits of typical commercial, residential, and traditional gallerybased projects, towards more flourishing environments.


<br>


<br>


For ten years, M&A has transformed a parking lot in Silver Lake into an internationallyacclaimed center for materials research and artistic expression on an architectural scale exhibiting largescale installations. M&A projects at this site are designed by artists and architects and built with volunteers from the community  winning three American Institute of Architects (AIA) awards, as well as other design awards and recognitions. M&A produced the inaugural performance for The Gettyâ€™s Pacific Standard Time with Judy Chicago  coordinating handson workshops for the public alongside the legendary artist to create an environment out of 25 tons of dry ice. The founder, Jenna Didier received the Neutra Spirit award 2010 and the Silver Lake History Collective award in 2011 for a lasting contribution to the cultural fabric of the Silver Lake district.

While M&A has been committed to working with â€œsustainableâ€ materials and environments long before the term was popular, projects that have specifically sought to bring public attention to environmental and sustainability issues include a pneumaticallyoperated origami robotic garden by Eddy Sykes and the communitydesigned Taco Garden which explored sustainable gardening techniques in an aquaponics garden that recirculated rainwater for growing tilapia and other fish taco ingredientsâ€”onions, cilantro and tomatoes.


<br>


<br>


Via a series of handson bilingual workshops commissioned by the Los Angeles Environmental Affairs Department, M&A managed the successful transformation of another blighted parking lot into a rainwater capturing surface with edible perimeter plantings tended by grateful mixed use building residents and employees. Some benefits were: decreases in stormwater runoff from the parking lot, decreases in heat island effect, increases in social engagement between building residents and employees working downstairs. Prior to our work, then had not even been introduced.


<br>


<br>


Under its latest Urban Applications initiative which includes START SEEING UGLY!, M&A seeks to expand its activity into the larger Los Angeles area.  Urban Applications is currently a finalist for an $350k ArtPlace grant from the NEA for the public art component of the Paseo and further development of its program. ","The following partners have already expressed an interest in assisting the effort to create the app, outreach campaign, and eventual site transformations:





The Council for Watershed Health (CWH)  project design, development of the website and database, and evaluation.





Councilman Eric Garcettiâ€™s Office  shared goals: community engagement, urban acupuncture, and the streamlining of the app to be a contributor to the new L.A. Open Source Database currently in development by the City. 





The L.A. Dept. of Cultural Affairs is enthusiastic about our outreach goals and the apps ability to identify those Council Districts whose constituents seek transformative art projects.





We are in communication with LACommons who would be an outreach partner.","START SEEING UGLY! is about sensitizing the public to be aware of their environment so that they can be agents of social change as volunteers and civic participants.


<br>


<br>


It is also about empowering all citizensâ€”including those suffering from isolation and disenfranchisementâ€”to accept their responsibility and the opportunity to facilitate change with their neighbors. Citizens living in underserved communities DO have the power to initiate improvements in their communities that will positively affect their families. As budget cuts deepen, it is contingent upon them to step into this power, which will deepen their â€œownershipâ€ in the local community, empower them, and lessen their social isolation.


<br>


<br>


As a test group under LA2050, M&A and CWH will work with middle school students near the Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project whose teachers have already expressed interest to use the START SEEING UGLY tools.  Success will be measured by how many of these youth and their families/ networks are using the app and website. We will measure:


<br>


<br>


Use of the START SEEING UGLY! tools.


<br>


Data: site traffic, the quantity of photo uploads, the number of districts with photo submissions, the quantity of userâ€™s comments, and others.  


<br>


Participation: tracking participants who use the online tools to see if they also become active in participating in handson workshops to envision and create new uses for sites they have helped to identify.


<br>


<br>


As the program develops, we will track workshop attendance, the quantity of workshop attendees who used the app, the quantity of workshop attendees who were introduced to the project through the â€œSTART SEEING UGLYâ€ campaign, the number of successful projects completed, workshop attendeesâ€™ feelings about their participation.


With the help of our project partner, the Council for Watershed Health, we will also be able to track environmental impacts such as stormwater infiltration rates to sites that get a full retrofit.


<br>


<br>


As part of M&Aâ€™s Urban Applications initiative, it is clearly the intent of the project partners to grow the project into a sustainable citywide system. Thus, it will be important to know if people becoming engaged with the online tools are also becoming active in their communities. To this end, as the tools are perfected under this grant, the project team will recruit agencies and CBOs working throughout the city to generate public participation in neighborhoods throughout the city.


","The Ugly App is a tool for an ongoing program to benefit LA impacting the way the City solves problems.  





First, a step beyond the Neighborhood Council system, it will provide involvement of all interested citizenseven those not currently empowered to initiate change in their communities. By inviting L.A.â€™s citizens to assist in mapping epidemic, interstitial or â€œleft overâ€ sites that are eroding the fabric of the City, the START SEEING UGLY! campaign will challenge Angelenos to engage in finding solutions. It is expected that many participating citizens will be making their first step into community involvement and a sense of ownership in their neighborhoodâ€™s surroundings. If they later engage in community meetings to advocate for site remediation and/or to participate in developing public art for public awareness, an informed and engaged citizenry is in the making for Los Angeles.





One significant impact could be the engagement of atrisk youth, in activity that guides them away from destructive acts and empowers them to be creative activists and stewards of their environment. This project will allow people who may have a history of disenfranchisement to engage with those that have the power to make change. By giving people a voice that is acknowledged and part of a larger effort to transform sites they helped select, trust will develop and encourage further volunteerism and stewardship





Second, the resulting open source database and mapping system will be available to everyone as well as to Los Angeles organizations and agencies in both the public and private sectors, from community farmers to artists to urban planners and financial investors, to be used in the development of intervention strategies for L.A. communities.


<br>


Finally, START SEEING UGLY!, by design, systematically identifies parcels that denigrate the environmental, social, and economic health of L.A. neighborhoods and provides the model process that can transform them through positive social and environmental change. After generating interest and support in the transformation of â€œuglyâ€ sites, M&A will work with Council Districts, the Council for Watershed Health and organizations already connected to communities where identified sites are located to embed each place with significance. In partnership with local stakeholders and citizens, landmark works of public art that inspire residents to take pride in their neighborhoods and become creatively engaged in their surroundings will be created and installed. It is expected that this effort will lead to widespread community pride, less graffiti, more vibrant places to walk and play, more activity in common areas of the neighborhood, and, thus, greater public safety.


<br>


This project will also leave behind a methodology and tool for collaborative investment by all stakeholders, especially underserved citizens, in improving the social and physical infrastructures of Los Angeles. ","Angelenos of 2050 are world leaders in the global movement towards increasing the livability of cities. The first generation born out of radically improved networks of communication and access to information, they have redefined the traditional relationship between individuals and civic organizations.


<br>


<br>


Residents are confident and connectedâ€”imbued with a sense of ownership in the future of their city. City institutions are agile bodies, reflexively contouring their expertise to nurture life and the needs of the people they serve. Unprecedented in their ability to listen to and acknowledge the daily experience of their citizens, they have constructed an infrastructure of communication and understanding that permeates relationships across sectors.


<br>


<br>


â€œUglyâ€ places are seen as opportunities to build something beautiful. Neighborhoods are no longer alienating places, but have become deeply personal with the histories of engagement reflected in a vital cityscape. Children feel deep belonging to their community and the built environments that sustain them.


<br>


<br>


In 2050, the LA River is a revitalized water system because residents understand the benefits of an EDA secured water supply, additional open park space, and a diversified ecosystem. They have effectively manifested their collective expectations in communications with both government and nonprofit organizations, and those organizations set up effective twoway channels of communication. Across interest groups, common ground helps define shared points of entry into large scale, dynamic, meaningful projects that transform blight into assets. Artists and ecologists collaborate to install art on sites that have been retrofitted to recharge the groundwater and produce clean free energy.


<br>


<br>


These same technologies dismantled barriers to high art, quality education and a sense of coownership in the fruits of our culture. All community members have the opportunity to work with and become artists, architects, and designers  developing the embodiment of the cityâ€™s cultural future, bringing landmark art out into the streets. Students in South L.A. can access maps of environmental hazards and see how they relate to crime, obesity rates and job opportunities. Using the same tools, they can convey their experience to City Council members and join urban gardening and public art groups working to make a difference. There is open dialogue around civic priorities and more defined and communitycentric policy.


<br><br>


How do we get there? It starts with universal access to intelligible information and pathways for action. This new found fluidity will transform the peopleâ€™s ability to understand their environmentâ€”to diagnose their needs and synthesize community values and political will into effective action. This will engender a system in which people can find their own voice and trust that it is heard by public officials. People will connect to one another and their surroundings"
3102172,2013172,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/urbanforest.html,Urban Forest, Environmental Quality,"Since the inception of the automobile, Los Angeles has been dramatically altered by the increasing amount of asphalt and concrete covering ground surfaces, which absorb incoming solar radiation and reradiate it as heat energy that raises the local air temperature. The higher temperatures  increase the formation of smog, heatrelated illnesses and the demand for energy as well as decrease the health level of people, plants and wildlife. Exacerbating this trend is the impact of the overall heating of the planet caused by global warming â€“ something has got to give.<br><br>





With a population of over 12 million people, the Los Angeles region is a major contributor of ozone and other pollutants that adversely affect climate  and temperature as well as air and water quality. As the population continues to grow, the demand for land and services near Los Angelesâ€™ urban center continues to increase, thereby increasing the amount of traffic, concrete and asphalt. The city is expected to reach a population of almost 40 million by 2050  so the time to approach this problem increasing heat island effect is now.  This problem is a significant opportunity to create a robust and effective program that addresses the issue in a truly innovative way.  The City has already embraced tree planting programs with admirable results however, we propose to address this problem holistically in a twofold manner â€“ by providing more trees while also mitigating the effects of the asphalt surfaces already in abundance throughout the urban core.<br><br>





Urban Forest is a pilot program for a nursery on private property, such as a privatesector business, that will provide trees to be planted in public spaces. Built on the idea of partnership, collaboration and exchange, the business (in this case American Apparel) will house the trees on their parking lot, allowing them to grow and be cared for in boxes. The Los Angeles Conservation Corps, a nonprofit organization, will lend a hand in maintaining the trees  offering up their expertise to American Apparel to ensure that the trees are properly cared for. When the trees are large enough to be transplanted, they will be picked up by partnering nonprofits and government agencies to be planted in public spaces throughout the City. <br><br>





In return for space allotment, utilities, operations and maintenance, American Apparel will create a greener, healthier, and more beautifulparking lot  that reverses the heat island effect and the City will gain more trees. In addition, Urban Forest also has the potential to be replicated in parking lots across the City  positively impacting even more acreage through the production of more trees at more locations around the City. As an increasing number of businesses join the program, the amount of trees available to be planted in the City will grow exponentially.<br><br>





Through this program, as a true multibenefit solution, several indicators will be addressed, primarily impacting health and environmental quality but also positively affecting the education,  income and employment indicators.  Initializing a program that not only improves upon existing inuse parking lots, but simultaneously provides trees for the greening of the City, will improve the environmental quality of the City and provide a healthier environment for both the employees of American Apparel and the locations where the trees are eventually planted. <br><br>





The program will not only improve the environment, but also provide jobs for local urban youth (through the participation of the Los Angeles Conservation Corps) as well as educate staff and create new jobs at American Apparel.  Through the visibility of the parking lot at American Apparel, the trees that are planted throughout the City, and a campaign initiated both online and through signage, awareness will increase about the program and the importance of green space in the City enhancing human development and making Los Angeles a better place to live.

	The amount of trees planted in Los Angeles by December 2013<br>


	A set of design guidelines and a production schedule for future implementation and replication<br><br>





The Urban Forest will also be evaluated on the following criteria:<br>

","Today, Southern California has the poorest air quality in the United States. The combination of copious amounts of asphalt, a distressed urban forest, and low amounts of accessible public park land are the largest contributors of this effect. Not to mention that city temperatures are getting higher â€“ but this trend can be reversed!<br>





As a catalyst for sustainable thinking and partnerships, the Urban Forest program has the potential to improve the overall environmental quality and positively impact the public health of the City transforming Los Angeles from a concrete jungle into a greener city â€“ perhaps to be known as the City of Trees.<br>





The trees will be planted throughout the City with a special emphasis on low income neighborhoods, industrial corridors, public school and public parks. The trees will provide cooling through evapotranspiration and by providing shade. The trees will also help improve our air quality by removing excess CO2 from the atmosphere and replacing it with oxygen, making it easier for  Angelenos to breathe and decreasing the asthma and respiratory health problems in the City. Furthermore, vegetation acts as a natural filter for water, picking up contaminants that will improve the overall water supply. <br>





In sum Los Angeles will greatly benefit from this program through improving air quality, decreasing the heat island effect, improving water quality, increasing awareness, decreasing health related risks and creating a healthier, more livable Los Angeles for generations to come. ","In 2050, Los Angeles will be transformed from a City of Asphalt to a City of Trees and a true Urban Forest will have been created. The heat island effect will decrease and the City will be more livable for future generations to come.<br><br>





One of the most exciting possibilities of this endeavor is its ability to be replicated in parking lots across the City creating a greener city at an expedited pace as the program grows. This means that over time, Los Angeles will become greener at a faster pace with the potential to be fully transformed into a sustainable city of the future in 2050.<br><br>





This will only increase the positive effect Urban Forest will have on all the aforementioned indicators. Environmental quality and health will be improved while there will be an increase in education and employment of LA city at risk youth, the work sector that engages in the program, and the Cityâ€™s community at large. <br><br>





In addition to a citywide adoption of private parking lot nurseries for public benefit, the awareness and education that is raised could also spur other projects that capitalize on this type of private public partnership for the good of the City overall increasing the Cityâ€™s well being and changing the course of the Cityâ€™s future into a sustainable regenerative metropolis.<br>

3102173,2013173,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/sisterblocks.html,Sister Blocks, Social Connectedness,"How about creating Sister Blocks, where the richer parts of town partner with the poorer parts? It would be handson, where real people would get to shake hands and listen to each otherâ€™s stories. If this were a happening thing, it would give affluent people a simple way to be volunteers, where it wouldnâ€™t be a big decision for each individual about which organization to give themselves to, but the group nature of it and the widespread practice would make it a natural for many people to participate. One of the unofficial ways I â€œgiveâ€ is to the people who work for me, who clean my house and do my gardening. I am generous to them beyond the fees they charge for their services.  When you know people personally, if you are of a generous nature it is very satisfying  to help them. This would be the same thing, writ large and systematized. So, let a block from Beverly Hills get to know a block from South Central, with the idea of seeing how they can help.





Facilitation would be needed at the start. And meeting places, like schools or banks or community rooms. But it is so simple and so doable and could be so far reaching, even creating a model program for the rest of the world.


","Flying under the radar, I have been a sort of underground for progressive thought, where some of the people at the edge have inspired others of us at many salon type events I've held. My blog, called ""Making Sense of These Times,"" reaches thousands. My mission is to influence thought to where we rethink our worldview, and without having names, like projects might, I have fostered a community of thought whose interactions have led to things of note. I'm stepping out more publicly now producing a TEDx event (www.TEDxWestHollywood.com), where the intention is to deliver a body of talks that could activate people who want to change the world.","I am  the coordinator for a new TEDx branch, www.TEDxWestHollywood.com. TED looks for new ways to make impact and this would be something I think they could promote all over the country. And I personally have been a hub for progressive activists in Los Angeles, with years of salons at my house and other productions in larger quarters catering to leaders of thought, so I have many alliances. Should this project be accepted, there are many collaborators that could be enrolled. ","Success would be evident by the obvious buzz of strangers becoming people who care about one another. I just want to say how awed and thrilled I would be if this old idea of mine actually saw light of day. I have felt the power of it and have not had an opening to deliver it before. I am not doing this for the award, where I was all right about my own money helping it to occur but could not find the partnering. If this happened I would feel like I made my life's contribution to ushering in the new paradigm of connectedness that we so need.","It would, in simple handson fashion, create a connectivity in Los Angeles that would be felt everywhere and cost next to nothing.","An air of cooperation would prevail. Fear would have subsided, with needier people knowing they were in a caring world. Hunger and homelessness would not be in play. Everyone's basic needs would be met. And the care of those in power would have raised the standards of everyone to where people could lead productive, successful lives, and social mobility would be the order of the day. People would know they were in a system that was watching out for them and rooting for them."
3102174,2013174,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FruitTreesforLA.html,Million Trees LA  Plant Toward a Sustainable Urban Forest That Supports Healthy Families ., Environmental Quality,"Million Trees LA (MTLA) is a citywide initiative launched in September 2006 by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. MTLA is a collaborative effort of the City of Los Angeles, community groups, businesses and individuals, working together to plant and provide longterm stewardship of LAâ€™s urban forest. Trees provide shade and save on energy costs, clean the air and help reduce green house gases that cause global warming, capture polluted urban runoff, improve water quality and add beauty to our neighborhoods.








Million Trees LA would like to have a series of fruit tree adoptions with a focus on food deserts and deliver fruit trees to people who live or own property within the City of Los Angeles. A fruit tree adoption is where tress are available for free to be planted on residential properties and people are provided information on to plant and care for trees. People adopt a tree and pledge to plant it on their private property. In addition to the environmental benefits of fruit trees, such as improving air quality, fruit trees give people access to healthy food that they grow. 





It is important for everyone to have access to healthy food options, such as fruit. Peopleâ€™s geographic area should not prevent them from having fresh, healthy food. By providing fruit trees in the City of Los Angeles, including food deserts, we are giving people the opportunity to improve their health and help the environment. 





Giving away fruit trees either at fruit trees adoptions or by delivering the fruit trees to residential properties for planting, gives people access to fresh, healthy foods while planting a tree that will reduce greenhouse gases, help them save energy by providing shade and capture storm water to replenish groundwater tables. Locally grown food also reduces any pollution emitted by the transportation of fruit from far away places. This will also provide people with the ability to add green space where they live. 





There are also social benefits provided by trees. More than 8% of children in Los Angeles217,000 suffer from asthma. Studies have shown that an increase in treelined streets could lower that number by 25%. Research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference in Chicago showed that the presence of trees could cut crime by as much as 7%. 





Specific Activities:


(1)	MTLA will work with our partners to coordinate and host a series of fruit tree adoptions and to manage the delivery of the fruit trees to private property located in the City of Los Angeles 


(2)	MTLA will work with our partners and community organizations to conduct community outreach and inform people of the availability of the free fruit trees.


(3)	MTLA will conduct outreach to community organizations and businesses to secure sites to do the fruit tree adoptions, focusing on food deserts.


(4)	 Door to door canvassing before the fruit tree adoption will take place in the geographic area around the fruit tree adoption site.


(5)	Our goal is to adopt or deliver to homes 1000 (5 gallon) fruit trees.


(6)	In order to adopt 1000 fruit trees we will need to have 5 fruit tree adoptions. The adoptions would take place during the June 2013December 2013 grant period. 


(7)	5 gallon fruit trees will made available for MTLAâ€™s Residential Tree Program, so residents of the City of Los Angeles can obtain free fruit trees to be planted on their private property. The tree will be delivered to them with the instructions and the materials needed to plant the tree. 





Million Trees LA is currently able to deliver free shade trees to people who live or own property in the City of Los Angeles through our Residential Tree Program. With the support of this grant we can expand the Residential Tree Program to include fruit trees and have fruit tree adoptions focused in food deserts in the City of Los Angeles. This will give people access to healthy foods and reduce their energy costs. 


","400,000 Trees by July 2013


Million Trees LAâ€™s publicprivate collaboration has planted over 380,000 trees and is on track to plant 400,000 trees by July 2013. 





Rate of Planting6X the last two administrations





According to the City of Los Angeles Urban Forest Division, Los Angles (including the City, NGOs and developers) planted an average of 10,000 trees annually during the previous two administrations. With limited resources and no direct funding from the Cityâ€™s General Fund, MTLA has increased the annual tree planting sixfold (average 60,000/year).





Rate of Survival Double the National Average


Research conducted by the US Forest Service, the national new tree mortality rate is between 10% and 12%. MTLAâ€™s mortality rate is half the national average at 4% and 5%. 





A National Model


The US Forest Service conducted a national study of large municipal tree planting programs in 2010/11 and found Million Trees LA to be a top model. 





Awards Received


2012â€œBest Urban Forestry Programâ€ Award received from California urban Council





2009â€œOutstanding Achievement Awardâ€ from the Environmental Protection Agency. 


","The Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC) is currently our partner who coordinates with us to deliver trees to private properties in the City of Los Angeles through our residential tree program. LACC is also our partner who obtains the trees for both the Residential Program and the Fruit Tree Adoptions. 





MTLA also partners with Fuego TechFire Rangers , Hollywood/Los Angeles Beautification Team, Koreatown Youth and Community Center, North East Trees, and TreePeople to plant trees and conduct fruit tree adoptions. 


","The metrics we will utilize for success will be determined by how many fruit trees are adopted or secured. In addition success will also be measured by community engagement, creation of new collaborations and the success of continued partnerships. 





The project goal is to enhance environmental benefits and provide access to healthy food. This project will also allow us to educate the next generation on the importance of trees. 


","The trees planted will sequester the carbon dioxide in the air and provide oxygen to breathe. A total of 300 trees can counter balance the amount of pollution one person produces in a lifetime. Trees shade our homes. This saves energy, so people who adopt these fruit trees will receive energy savings.





Tress raise ground water tables and are useful in helping to capture, filter, and restore rainwater to the groundwater table.





Trees provide many benefits including: 





â€¢	More than 8% of children in Los Angeles â€“ 217,000 â€“ suffer from asthma. Studies have shown that an increase in treelined streets could lower that number by almost 25%. 





â€¢	Research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference (AAAS) in Chicago showed that the presence of trees could cut crime by as much as 7% 





â€¢	Two University of Illinois researchers (Kuo and Sullivan) studied how well residents of the Chicago Robert Taylor Housing Project (the largest public housing development in the world) were doing in their daily lives based upon the amount of were fewer contact they had with trees and came to the following conclusions: there are fewer reports of physical violence in homes that had trees outside the buildings. Of the residents interviewed, 14% of residents living in barren conditions have threatened to use a knife or gun against their children





These fruit trees will provide benefits to each individual or family who plants them beyond the environmental benefits that everyone who breathes air in Los Angeles will receive. They will be able to grow their own food. For some families, these fruit trees may be the only access to fresh, healthy food that they have. Fruit trees will help adults and children incorporate healthier foods into their diet. 





One example of a food desert is South Los Angeles. According to the Community Health Councilâ€™s South Los Angeles Health Equity Scorecard, there is 0.10 supermarkets per square mile over 44,000 square feet in size.


","Success in the Year 2050 would be to increase the percentage of City of Los Angeles residents having fruit or shade trees in their home. For the City of Los Angeles to continue to serve as the model to replicate, so that other cities within Los Angeles County also provide fruit trees to its residents.





Clean Air and Healthy Lifestyle 


Success would be for each of the families who received a fruit tree to have enjoyed the environmental benefits of the tree including breathing cleaner air and enjoying a healthy lifestyle. 





A new generation of environmental leaders


The young adults who worked to make this happen continue to work to protect the environment either professionally or in their personal time and are giving the youth of 2050 the opportunity to work on protecting the planet. 





A healthy urban forest


A healthy urban forest that makes the City of Los Angeles a greener, healthier place to live is what success would like for our indicator in 2050. Although our focus is the City of Los Angeles, a healthy urban forest is necessary for our planet.

3102175,2013175,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/mindsonfire.html,Building A Community of Leaders One Middle School Student at a Time, Education,"Minds on Fire is a new initiative that actively empowers middle school students who are most at risk for dropping out to succeed as learners and community leaders. Minds on Fire will improve middle school attendance, student engagement and achievement by empowering students to apply academic coursework to the realworld issues they care about.    





Students take ownership of their education by creating connections between their classroom lessons with studentled community projects. MOF will place trained â€˜Mind Partnersâ€™ retired teachers and college grads  in each class to work with and support teachers. These Mind Partners will work with teachers and administrators to build frameworks for projects that fit the content and pacing of each teacherâ€™s curriculum. They will work directly with students as they design and execute their project. Mind Partners fill a range of roles, from facilitating studentled discussions about the issues they care most about to identifying developmentally appropriate projects that utilize the skills of the particular academic unit; from engaging parents, community partners, businesses and/or government strategically to seeking project funding.   





The work of students and teachers will be amplified through a network of â€˜reallifeâ€™ and virtual platforms, creating a growing community of engaged and knowledgeable Angelenos.  Students and teachers will be able to exchange ideas and share experiences throughout the school year through an online platform. Teachers and school leaders will be able to connect with one another and other community leaders through quarterly â€˜learn and linkâ€™ events. And the entire Minds on Fire community will celebrate their achievements at a yearend event that showcases student impact and academic achievement. 





Student voice is central to this approach. In a national survey, students who themselves had dropped out told us how they would improve schools (1). Among their comments, students asked for:


 81%  Opportunities for realworld learning (e.g. servicelearning, internships) to make classroom more relevant


 81%  Better teachers who keep classes interesting


 75%  Smaller classes with more individual instruction  





These comments are borne out in the research findings and recommendations of education experts like Dr. Robert Balfanz of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins and Dr. William Daggett of the International Center for Leadership on Education. The Minds on Fire model incorporates these concepts through use of studentled, projectbased learning with immediate goals and opportunity for success. The classroomlevel support allows facilitates exciting learning in personalized, smallgroup work among students.  


 


Los Angeles is home to a disproportionate number of Americaâ€™s Dropout Factories â€“ schools in which less than 60% of students who enter high school in 9th grade graduate on time. Minds on Fire will focus outreach to schools that feed into these Dropout Factories and where middle school students are most likely to be struggling. By targeting these â€˜feederâ€™ middle schools, we can reduce the dropout rates in the schools hurt most by a loss of students. 





We can identify which students are most likely to dropout of school in high school based on their middle school performance (2). Dr. Balfanz coined the term â€˜ABCs to describe these indicators â€“ Attendance, Behavior and Course performance. His research is echoed in the findings of others, including the California Dropout Prevention Center. Minds on Fire will work with students who demonstrate risk for dropping out based on use of the ABCs â€“ students who:


 Attend school less than 80 percent of the time


 Have repeated behavior problems and/or problems that are mild but sustained


 Fail one or more courses, particularly in math or English.


 


Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in 2011 â€œAs a target for school reform, the middle grades present the last, best opportunity for educators to reach all studentsâ€”and not just those who persist and thrive in high school.â€ Minds on Fire deploys a classroomlevel reform model to increase the likelihood of at riskstudents leaving middle school prepared to succeed and graduate from high school. In the first year of operation we plan to serve 300 youth in up to six schools, helping that many of the most atrisk middle school students stay on the path to graduation. By Year 3 of operations we will be serving 1,500 students per year, a figure large enough to have a significant impact on the 9th grade dropout rate. In the 201011 school year, 3,000 9th graders dropped out of LAUSD schools.

However, the organizationâ€™s founder created and piloted a similar model in New York City public schools as part of Mayor Bloombergâ€™s inaugural NYC Civic Corps in 2009, an initiative launched in partnership with AmeriCorps VISTA to engage people across that city in volunteerism. The Minds on Fire model is shaped by the successes and learnings taken from that pilot, in combination with a deep understanding of the Los Angeles education landscape and challenges specific to our school system.





In the NYC Civic Corps program, a threemember team of VISTA Volunteers engaged 197 student and teacherleaders  and 4,721 students across 58 schools in the development and implementation of service and service learning opportunities. 


","MOF is in the process of developing partnerships with schools and community agencies. The most critical partnerships will be with the individual teachers and school leaders in MOF schools. We will also work with the education management organizations that have oversight for likely MOF schools along with leaders of the LAUSD. Other partnerships will be based on the needs of the specific communities in which students are implementing their projects. We will develop new partnerships and collaborations with community agencies, businesses and local government as defined by project needs. MOF is also engaging with foundations to build a sustainable future for the organization.  ","Minds on Fire will use a rigorous evaluation tool to identify and measure the impact of Minds on Fire on participating students. Key to our approach will be comparing data for participating students against nonparticipating students from the same school and schools with similar characteristics where Minds on Fire is not in place.





The evaluation will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to provide a full picture of impact on student and community.





Attendance â€“ Use school attendance data to track (1) all student attendance levels and (2) change in number of students who miss 20 or more days of school in a year  





Behavior disruptions â€“ Use school level data to measure (1) number of behavior infractions and (2) change in number of students with 2 or more infractions





Classroom grades â€“ Use District data and teacherdata and to (1) track number of classes failed by participating students, (2) compare student grades in classes and individual class units using MOF approach with nonparticipating students. 





CST scores â€“ Use District data to evaluate impact on CST scores in relevant content areas. 





Student hope, engagement and college aspiration  Use a modified version the Gallup Student Poll tool to track studentâ€™s feelings before and after participating in MOF. Gallup polling has found a strong correlation between the factors of student hopefulness, engagement and wellbeing to college success. Hope in particular is shown to be a stronger predictor than GPA or test scores (1).  





Teacher satisfaction â€“ Develop a teacher poll in collaboration with participating schools to measure teachersâ€™ feelings about value and impact of program.





School and Teacher Quality â€“ Utilize LAUSD data as available for school and teacher contributions to Academic Growth over Time.


 


Connectedness â€“ Measure (1) participation in quarterly teacher/community â€˜link and learnâ€™ events, (2) student use of MOF blog to share ideas and (3) participation in yearend celebration event. 





Community Impact â€“ Track number of students who complete community projects, specific impact to the community of projects.





Persistence through high school â€“ Use district data to follow studentsâ€™ progression through high school. Increased number of atrisk students persisting through high school and graduating on time. 3,000 students dropped out of LAUSD schools in the year between the end of 8th grade and the end of 9th grade in 2012.

","Over time, Minds on Fire will build a corps of young leaders with the skills, confidence and commitment to effectively address challenges in their communities. They will enter high school prepared to graduate on time, with aspirations for college, career and civic life. 





And while the mission of Minds on Fire is to decrease the dropout rate for Los Angelesâ€™s most atrisk middle school students, this project will have additional benefits spanning student achievement, youth development, teacher quality and communitywide engagement. 





Minds on Fire will start by working with 300 students across six schools. If that rate continues through 2050 (a conservative estimate), over 11,000 students will have participated. 





Because Minds on Fire looks at the Early Warning Indicators to identify students most at risk of dropping out, we will help students who would otherwise have dropped out succeed in school. They will develop the skills necessary for a successful postsecondary experience and in the workforce, namely: time management, collaboration, creative thinking, research and the academic skills that form the basis for these projects. 





28,000 students drop out of school in LA County each year. 12,500 dropped out of LAUSD schools in 2011(1).  If only 1,000 more students made it to graduation, there would still be a significant impact on the economy: They would likely (2):


â€¢	Earn as much as $15 million in additional earnings in an average year;


â€¢	Spend an additional $900,000 each year purchasing vehicles    


â€¢	Spend up to $45 million more on homes than they would likely spend without a diploma; and


â€¢	Support as many as 130 new jobs in the region


â€¢	Increase the gross regional product by up to $21 million, and pour as much as an additional $1.8 million annually into state and local coffers, all through their increased spending and investments.


 


Improving graduation rates has a positive impact on community life. That, combined with the specifically communityproblemsolving focus of this initiative would lead to an improvement in Los Angeles residentsâ€™ life expectancy, health status, and voting rates while also reducing the crime rate and the associated costs to incarcerate criminals (3).  





Young people across the country have already demonstrated their power to make change. Imagine if LA had thousands more young people exploring their own ideas for change â€“ the potential is impossible to calculate, and a very real possibility.

","An education system that significantly enhances human development is one that provides all children with not only a path to college, but also with the knowledge, skills and experiences to build fulfilling lives, however the individual defines that term. And it is a system that inspires confidence in all families and teachers who are part of it, in which the zip code in which one lives has no bearing on the quality of education one has access to.   





In this future, schools will have earned the public support they need to function at the highest possible level â€“  so teachers, community members, parents and students together can foster an excitement for learning."
3102176,2013176,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LendingCircles.html,Building on LAs Social Capital , Income & Employment,"<p>In Los Angeles, tens of thousands of lowincome residents live on the margins of Californiaâ€™s economy. They have no bank accounts, credit scores or any hope of getting conventional loans to buy cars, start businesses, or apply for citizenship. Even renting an apartment may be out of reach.</p>





<p>By working with two Los Angelesbased organizations, we propose propose to bring Lending Circles for Citizenship and the Security Deposit Loan Program for the first time to Southern California.</p>





<p>Mission Asset Fund (MAF), a nonprofit organization, provides a way out of the financial shadows by capitalizing on the hidden strengths of people living on the financial fringes: networks of friendships and commitments to helping one another. In a timehonored practice of cultures throughout the world, lowincome people come together to provide each other with support simply by lending and borrowing money from each other. Through its Lending Circles Program, MAF formalizes these social loans and provides financial education to participants. It reports loan repayments to credit bureaus, building credit files that improve participantsâ€™ financial standing. Many members establish credit scores for the first time, while others rebuild damaged scores. Each year, 12 million Americans who turn to payday lenders for small, shortterm loans each year end up paying $7.5 billion in fees and charges (The Pew Center).  With a good credit score, participants are able to rent homes and apartments, access lowcost loans and avoid predatory lenders.</p>





<p>In just five years, MAFâ€™s social lending models have helped 1,700 people in six U.S. states, with annual loan capital skyrocketing from $15,000 to $660,230. Under this proposal, MAF will bring two new programs to Los Angeles to help lowincome residents open the doors to citizenship and stable housing.</p> 





<p>WHY CITIZENSHIP?  Citizenship is an asset that provides individuals the ability to earn more money, lower rates of poverty, and increase financial stability. Yet, in California alone, hundreds of thousands of people eligible for U.S. citizenship are deterred by the $680 fee required to submit the N400 naturalization application. In 2011, MAF piloted the Lending Circles for Citizenship program with three Bay Area organizations. The program has already yielded successful results, with 39 citizenship checks submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and 14 citizenship applications approved.</p>





<p>WHY HOUSING? Securing a first apartment and coming up with a rent deposit often keeps homeless and foster youth hopping from couch to couch or sleeping on the streets. In response, MAF launched the Security Deposit Loan (SDL) program in 2012 to help ease their transition into the mainstream financial system. This innovative approach helps young people overcome their challenges by providing the means to pay for a security deposit on their first apartment through a creditbuilding loan.</p>





<p>TWO PROGRAMS, ONE CITY: MAF will expand these two models (Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security Deposit Loans) to Los Angeles, helping struggling people attain assets like citizenship and the ability to secure stable housing. Expansion will occur over one year by partnering with two community partners that serve economically excluded populations. MAF will help 50 people gain citizenship status through social loans, while another 50 people will use rent deposit loans to secure stable housing for their families. Participants will increase their credit scores and overall financial health because transactions will be reported to main credit bureaus.</p>





<p>Lending Circles for Citizenship will bring groups of people eligible for U.S. citizenship together to lend and borrow money to finance $510 to pay for their citizenship application fees. After they successfully work with legal services agencies to complete citizenship classes, each participant will receive a 25% match incentive ($170). All loans are secure, provided at 0% interest with $0 fees.</p> 





<p>The Security Deposit Loan project will transform security deposits into a responsible financial product and a savings and creditbuilding opportunity for disadvantaged young people who struggle to obtain stable housing. In partnership with agencies providing transitional housing, young people will sign promissory notes and program agreements for security deposit vouchers accepted by these landlords. MAF will collect monthly payments from participants, and reports payment activity to credit bureaus.  By the end of their graduation from transitional housing, participants will have saved enough for a security deposit on their next apartment, and they will have spent two years establishing positive credit histories and credit scores â€“ assets they will need to get a new apartment.</p> ","<p>MAFâ€™s Lending Circles program has received widespread national attention for its success in helping low income families gain access to capital, build financial capability, and increase access to lowcost loans for education, homes, and small business startup. To date, over 1,700 participants have made $1.7 million in social loans, resulting in a 99% repayment rate and under 1% in defaults. Because these loans have zero interest and zero fees, participants have saved an estimated $350,000. Average credit scores were raised by 49 points, often the difference between subprime and prime credit.</p>





<p>MAF was honored to receive the 2012 Bank of America Neighborhood Builders Award, 2012 Latino Leaders Maestro Award, 2012 Ashoka Fellowship, and 2013 James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award. Last year, our Executive Director Jose Quinonez was also appointed Chair of the Consumer Advisory Board for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>","<p>Pilipino Workerâ€™s Center was formed in LA in 1997 to meet the immediate needs of low to moderateincome workers & advocate for longterm change. They have partnered with MAF since 2011. Grant funding will expand our partnership to include Lending Circles for Citizenship.</p>


<p>Since 1985, New Economics for Women has reduced poverty by creating & building wealth opportunities for families & neighborhoods. MAF proposes to pursue a new partnership with NEW to help 50 formerly homeless single mothers (ages 16 to 24) in a transitional housing program enroll in the SDL program. Another partner, Citibank, has the largest financial services network in the world, with 16,000 offices in 140 countries around the globe and provides access.</p>","<p>Over a oneyear period, MAF will support two LAbased community organizations to successfully implement the Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security Deposit Loan models. Through the project, a total of 100 participants will be served, including 50 who will enroll in Lending Circles for Citizenship and 50 who will enroll in the Security Deposit Loan program. Process objectives will include:</p>


<p>â€¢ Supplying technical assistance, training, program development, and a packaged curriculum (including howtokits, model program agreements, promissory notes, selection criteria, etc.) to the two selected organizations.</p>


<p>â€¢ Engaging a total of 100 people in the Los Angeles area over the oneyear grant cycle.</p>





<p>As a result of these activities, the project will achieve the following indicators:</p>


<p>â€¢ 100 participants will be enrolled.</p>


<p>â€¢ Lending Circles for Citizenship participants will achieve $51,000 in social loan volume (savings for citizenship).</p>


<p>â€¢ SDL participants will achieve an estimated in loan volume of $37,500 (based on an average security deposit of $750).</p>


<p>â€¢ Citizenship participants will receive a 25% match totaling $8,500.


<p>â€¢ 100% of participants will be banked and on the road to financial mainstream.</p>


<p>â€¢ Participants will establish a credit score, or will build thin credit files into thick ones.</p>





<p>To evaluate the impact of these efforts, MAF will collect data related to: 1) the number of participants enrolled in Lending Circles for Citizenship and the SDL; 2) the percentage of individuals with bank accounts; 3) repayment rates; 4) savings accumulated toward citizenship and apartment security deposits; and 5) the number of successful citizenship applicants and apartment leases secured. Depending on the needs and interest of partner organizations, data may be also be gathered and analyzed to assess increases in individual credit scores, improvements in participant financial capability, and changes in participantsâ€™ ability to access and utilize credit as a tool to further their goals. All information will be tracked using our proprietary Salesforce.com platform.</p>","<p>The driving force for creating the Lending Circles for Citizenship model is to simultaneously provide immigrants with tools for financial integration while enhancing the capacity of immigrant services organizations to support this process. Based on the success of the pilot, MAF is confident that the model has the potential for expansion among additional communitybased partners in Los Angeles. Upon the passage of Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR), social lending can serve as a model for helping undocumented immigrants collectively pool their money to pay for any penalty needed to adjust their status.</p> 





<p>With respect to its impact in Los Angeles, the Lending Circles for Citizenship model will increase civic participation among the regionâ€™s legal permanent resident population. Going beyond theoretical classroom knowledge, immigrants will have the opportunity to achieve reallife, tangible, and measurable outcomes, such as opening bank accounts at mainstream financial institutions, saving and applying for citizenship, and increasing credit scores. Moreover, the program will increase the capacity of Los Angeles nonprofit organizations to provide a responsible, trustworthy, and socially conscious financial product that improves financial outcomes for their clients.</p> 





<p>Similar to Lending Circles for Citizenship, the benefits of the Security Deposit Loan program also have a tremendous impact on the ability of participants to achieve their goals. Through receiving an affordable loan repayable over two years, renting an apartment becomes accessible to participants. In addition to decreasing housing instability and homelessness, the programâ€™s financial and social benefits on the Los Angeles population include:</p> 





<p>1.	Renting a first apartment will become accessible to people who currently lack savings.


2.	The loan will be paid back over two years, making monthly payments affordable.


3.	The process will provide a safe lending experience that models and encourages responsible financial behavior and success.


4.	The loan will improve credit scores and develop a pot of savings for future rent deposits.</p>","<p>By the year 2050, MAF envisions a world in which all people have access to fair and responsible lowcost credit and high quality financial products and services. In this future world, predatory lenders and fringe financial establishments have been decimated or no longer exist because improved options widely exist for lowerincome and economically disadvantaged populations. Success also means that people will learn to save and keep money in their pocket as a strategy for preventing financial calamity when unexpected emergencies and life occurrences occur. A large part of this vision means that MAF must ensure people have the opportunity to qualify for prime rates and quality financial products, resources that will help them build assets and invest in their futures through things like citizenship, homeownership, and their childrenâ€™s education.</p>"
3102177,2013177,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/mloveizm.html,MLoveizm Supports Empowers and Inspires Los Angeles Artists,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"South Central Los Angeles, known for itâ€™s notorious mentions in rap songs, seedy motels and abandoned houses, gang wars and riots, has a population of sickness and disease, violence, drug and human trafficking and it all starts with a corrupted mindset.  MLoveizm stands as a beacon of light to reach those who feel suppressed, stifled and limited in their community through the medium of art.  Art transcends demographics through a deep seeded sense of relatability in life experiences, thought processes that strikes a nerve to take action.   Our first big goal is to facilitate a creative environment where Artists can learn through internships, business development/entrepreneurship, workshops, artist showcases, and jobs through future publications like MLoveizm magazine, upcoming book projects, film documentaries, art inspiration field trips and more for local Artists as well as those who travel to South Central to grow and learn.  The jobs would be mainly artistic such as filming, photographing, editing, lighting, writing, painting, fabricating, designing, styling, researching and more.  We would also like to facilitate business minded individuals that understand and appreciate the arts as the oil to our engine and further teach in our workshops as well. We take a deep interest in character building emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually.  Our hopes is to meet the Artist where they are at in their life and cultivate the greatness within through collaboration, education, practical skill and business building.  We want the Artist to exude confidence just as much as their work does. From starting off as Artists, growing as entrepreneurs and innovators we know what it is like to gain ground on making dreams become reality and bringing up as many Artists and art supporters as possible in the process. 


","From working, guiding, promoting, encouraging and teaching artists, we have seen them go on to attain more jobs as entrepreneurs, build their own brands, manage their creative and business time, and develop confidence in heart and mind.  We have impacted Artists in knowledge, perspective, understanding and wisdom in their personal life as well as provoked them to dig deeper and see meaning in art as well as create depth in their own work.  We are pleased to see our imprint on individuals as they go on to transform the world in positive sustainable ways.","MLoveizm is ran by the founders/Artists Melissa LeslieQuinones and Daniel Quinones.  Currently we work with Alleyne Connect, Arianna Sikorski and two interns.  We hope to open the opportunities with funding.


","We recently have other likeminded individuals that are catching the vision and supporting the heartbeat.  We currently are working on demographic and impact spreads from past events and online analytics. We have rose from 3 people showing up to our Art Day events in 2010 to around 1530 currently and growing. We are now streamlining Art Day to once a month and Workshops starting this April bimonthly.  We hope to have at least 15 or more enroll per Workshop and to grow from there.   Currently we have 2 interns working twice a week with more inquiries to volunteer. We hope to have 5 or more for parttime positions during business hours. We also hope to give jobs for booking/scheduling and logistics, event planners, business writers, public relations, filming, editing, photographing, journalism, animators, illustrators, nutritionists and botanists. We have already witnessed the benefits artists are experiencing from MLoveizm's TV interviews opening doors for Artists to use them as a media resume.  We have also seen interns create their own businesses and branding to further their dreams.  We have spoken with Artists who say their confidence has increased and others say they feel like it's a family.  On countless occasions, those who come in our doors are immediately inspired and feel like creating even if they're not artists themselves. Collectively we have over 25,000 followers on social sites alone and have seen our MLoveizm page reach from 2,300 to over 9,100 in the past 2 months. Our reach is core to LA but easily pours over into a worldwide interest with a growing curiosity in Brazil, United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy and more.  Although some would say South Central is hopeless, we see something else here, we see the potential. Our core team has shown great personal, technical and business growth just by our meetings alone. 


","MLoveizm Magazine facilitates opportunity to build character, expand thought processes, develop business mindsets and think on a deeper level of production in all areas of art to create movement through value and purpose. We focus on the end goal in order to navigate through the lasting importance of their mission by asking â€œWill it help others?â€ We do this by connecting, collaborating, encouraging, and taking practical steps forward in personal and business identity, social networking and creating opportunities to become involved in group projects and production that not only create training but jobs and outreach to places beyond South Centralâ€™s four walls.  We believe art can create revolutions, change minds, touch hearts and provoke action.  MLoveizm hopes to cultivate Artists that create art that will do just that.  The ripple effect will be endless and to everyoneâ€™s benefit not only in LA but everywhere. We hope it starts in LA.


","In 2050 there will be more opportunities for artists in South Central to be encouraged by the satisfaction of working in the arts and doing what they love.  This will place confidence in the Artist and their families..It will also nurture them to be able to teach others skills and knowledge to create a ripple effect with art that can change the landscape not only in public venues but in and around homes and most importantly in the hearts of our Los Angeles tribe.  There will be more opportunities for individuals to experience art and the benefits it creates by those it touches to think differently, speak accordingly and act in faith of future change.  We hope to have attained a large building where everything we do can be pushed to greater levels.  The building would facilitate art shows, workshops, art days, film productions, film screenings, offices and our own MLoveLife cafÃ© where we would also make healthy juices, smoothies and more.  The cafÃ© would also serve as a place to learn about health in body, mind and spirit.  By then we hope to have had at least 18 books published, at least 72 magazines published, several documentaries created, 9 world tours, MLoveizm hubs in several major art cities and secure 1020 jobs in each hub for artists and business professionals.  We also hope the numbers for interns and volunteers to increase as well!  We are currently in the process of gaining our 501c as well!"
3102178,2013178,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/StudentEcoRiders.html,Student Eco Riders, Environmental Quality,"Wouldnâ€™t it be great if your college student ID was also your transit pass? It is if your student ID is from Santa Monica College and you get to ride â€œAny Line, Any Timeâ€ on the Big Blue Bus. Itâ€™s a triple win â€“ for students, transit agencies and colleges.  Students get to ride â€œAny Line, Any Timeâ€ for a nominal fee each semester, the transit agency has more riders, and the college doesnâ€™t have to build so much parking. Whether or not youâ€™re a student you benefit from less traffic in the neighborhoods surrounding colleges and less air pollution in the LA Basin. With less driving, lower greenhouse gases and less emissions, the environment and our health are the really big winners. Thatâ€™s why we call it â€œStudent Eco Riders.â€ 





Hereâ€™s how it works in Santa Monica. Fourteen dollars of the student body fee each Santa Monica College student pays go towards â€œpurchasingâ€ the transit passes each semester. Santa Monica College also kicks in some money, too.  The Big Blue Bus gets additional revenues and additional riders allowing them to increase bus service.  The student ID is a smart card that is programed to work on the Big Blue Bus.





Students at 10 other Southland colleges also ride free on any line at any time  CSU Long Beach, UC Riverside, Chaffey College, Crafton Hills College, San Bernardino Valley College, Rio Hondo College, Riverside City College, California Baptist University, La Sierra University and Mt. San Jacinto College. Itâ€™s time to get more colleges and more students on transit!





Under the banner of Student Eco Riders, Move LA wants to bring together other transit agencies, colleges and student governments to get them all jazzed up about the possibilities and particulars of getting college students unlimited access to transit. Weâ€™ll convene key players to talk about what has worked and what could be better using the experience in Santa Monica with the Big Blue Bus, in Long Beach with Long Beach Transit, in Riverside with the Riverside Transit Agency and in San Bernardino with Omnitrans. Weâ€™ll find the right people at the colleges, transit agencies and student governments who want to make this happen and bring them together to push forward on new agreements covering many more students.  





Student Eco Riders hits several bottom lines for the LA weâ€™d all like to see in 2050. Fewer people driving means cleaner air, which we need way more of in smoggy Los Angeles  for the environment and for our health. Getting by with one less car has a huge positive impact on your pocketbook to the tune of $8,000/year per car â€“ a major income boost for most people. And thereâ€™s nothing like a transit system that everyone uses to increase the social connectedness in a place.  What are we waiting for: Vote for Move LAâ€™s Student Eco Riders!


","Move LA built the powerful businesslaborenvironmental coalition that worked with LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and LA Metro to get the Measure R halfcent sales tax for transportation on the ballot in 2008 and ensure its passage. Because of Measure R Los Angeles has embarked on this countryâ€™s most ambitious transit expansion â€” a virtual doubling of the size of LA Countyâ€™s light rail, subway and bus way transit system from 120 miles and 103 stations to 236 miles and 200 stations. 





Former Santa Monica Mayor Denny Zane recognized the opportunity created by the commitment of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, then in his first term, to building a transit system. In January 2008, with the help of the Annenberg Foundation, Zane convened a â€œtransportation conversationâ€ with major stakeholders, including business, labor, and environmental leaders, agency leadership, elected officials, a pollster and a political consultant. It was decided on that fateful day to mount a campaign to get a county sales tax measure to build out a robust transit system on the ballot that November.





Mayor Villaraigosa has proved an energetic and skillful champion, and this coalition succeeded in passing the 30year Measure R sales tax to provide $25 billion for public transit â€” even as the Great Recession came howling down upon the nation. The Mayor, LA Metro and the Move LA coalition worked with the Obama Administration, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congress to secure funding and to create an ambitious new lowinterest loan program, that is the largest transportation infrastructure financing fund in the history of the U.S. Department of Transportation. 





Measure R construction is in full swing: Last year LA Metro opened the Expo Line to Culver City and the Orange Line extension to Chatsworth, construction began on Expo to Santa Monica and continued on the Foothill Extension of the Gold Line to Azusa. Utilities are being relocated so construction can begin on the Westside Subway and the Regional Connector, and Metro is showing off station designs for the Green Line extension to LAX and options for the Sepulveda corridor. Buoyed by this momentum this businesslaborenvironmental coalition went back to voters in November 2012 to extend Measure R and enable Metro to use the longer revenue stream to secure financing and accelerate construction â€” at a time when interest rates and construction costs are at historic lows. Measure J won an overwhelming 66.1% of the vote, proving voters enthusiastically support this transit revolution, but failed to pass because of a â€˜technicalityâ€™ â€” only in California do such measures require 2/3 voter approval to become law.





One clear measure of Move LAâ€™s success is that the Measure R campaign secured $25 billion for transit capital and operations, an investment expected to result in 400,000 good jobs and a major boost to the local and regional economy. 


","Move LAâ€™s forte is getting key people into the room together to see and seize the opportunities for addressing big problems. Thatâ€™s what we did in 2008 when we convened representatives from labor, business, and environmental groups to get Measure R on the ballot which has proven to be a game changer for transit in Los Angeles County. With Student Eco Riders we will reach out to municipal bus agencies and LA Metro, and to student governments and administrations at universities and community colleges.  The focus would be on the larger community colleges and universities and the municipal bus lines, including Metro,  that serve those campuses.","Student Eco Riders will be a success when by the end of the year at least four colleges and transit agencies are working together to set up pilot projects, with a plan for establishing a transit pass program for students. ","Transit is expanding in LA County thanks to voterapproved Measure R. Weâ€™ll get seven new light rail, subway and bus rapid transit lines over the next 30 years â€“ or possibly sooner if our efforts to accelerate the construction are successful.  Building ridership for the bigger and better transit is key to getting the environmental benefits weâ€™re after. 





Santa Monica Collegeâ€™s efforts are producing concrete results. A traffic study from 2010 found that whopping 40% of Santa Monica College's 34,000 students and 1,800 staff used the bus to get to campus in the morning. Thatâ€™s huge when you consider that in LA County less than 7% of people use transit to get to work now. In 2009, LA Community College District offered a deeply discounted transit pass to students ($15 for 6 months) and students took nearly six million transit trips that year and reduced VMT (vehicle miles traveled) by 42 million miles and CO2 emissions by 36 tons. Thatâ€™s the kind of impact we need to address climate change. In San Bernardino County, Omnitrans estimates that student ridership has risen from less than 5% to over 20% following a pilot program with free transit passes.





College students are the ideal group to win over to transit for several reasons. First, they are a significant part of the population, in fact, over the next decade about 10% of LA County residents will be enrolled in community colleges alone. And students are more mobile, more open to trying new things, more environmentally conscious, and more creative when it comes to stretching their limited budgets. Learning to take transit, or experimenting with living â€œcarlightâ€ makes a lot more sense to college students than it does to the general public.


","Transportation may not be a key indicator for LA 2050, but how we get around certainly impacts many other key indicators including the environment, health, social connectedness, income and employment and access to opportunity.  





Today less than a quarter of the people working in New York City drive to work alone, over half take the subway or bus.  Success in 2050 would be for three quarters of Angelenos to arrive at work by transit, walking, bicycling or some way other than driving alone. Santa Monica Collegeâ€™s experience with â€œAny Line, Any Timeâ€ translating into to 40% of students and staff arriving on campus by transit shows us that this is possible. Since currently 70% drive alone in Los Angeles, dropping that to 25% would represent a dramatic lowering of the number of miles traveled in vehicles chalked up. Less driving means less air pollution and, consequentially, fewer children with asthma â€“ a significant health impact.  Driving less also usually means more walking, which is critical in combatting our sedentary lifestyles, expanding waistlines and declining life expectancy â€“ yet another health impact. 





There are other very personal benefits of having transit that works, like relieving the burden on family budgets that are already strained by high gasoline prices, car repairs, insurance and all the costs of owning a car. On average it costs about $8,000/year to own a car. Freeing up that kind of  money in a working familyâ€™s budget could bring other things within reach â€“ buying health insurance, getting dental work done, getting child care, hiring a tutor, giving up a second job, going back to school, taking art classes or enjoying more cultural events.  





Less driving also means fewer greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.  LA Community College Districtâ€™s experience of just 6 million transit trips resulting in 42 million fewer miles driven and 36 fewer tons of carbon dioxide emissions shows that creating and promoting high quality transit can have an impact. 





Additionally, if fewer people are driving then we donâ€™t need so many parking places. Parking structures are expensive to build and take up valuable space on campus or in the heart of the city â€“ space that could be used for classrooms, ball fields, student housing, or a variety of places that are more fun to hang out in than parking lots. 





Finally, getting more people on transit can increase our social connectedness. Weâ€™re more likely to see our neighbors as we walk to and from our transit stop. Also being around people from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities while on transit can lessen the fear of others and help us connect to the diversity of Los Angeles County.

3102179,2013179,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MuirRanch.html,Kids who sling kale eat kale: Launch 5 School Garden CSAs in LAs Food Deserts, Education,"<p>Let us give kids jobs this summer growing and selling vegetables at 5 sites throughout Los Angeles. Let us finance their wouldbe produce empires with a replicable model that gives their nonprofit partners or even ""just classroom teachers"" the means to enable young eaters to engage in the business of #food.</p>





<p>We can expand our current program model of urban school garden and rural farm partnership and create Muir Ranch Community Supported Agriculture satellites (CSA) that insert really amazing food into high need communities at the same time provide opportunities for nonprofits with the energy and vision to be social entrepreneurs. </p>





<p>We work with farmers and their California abundance to provide really awesome food from the Santa Monica and Hollywood Farmers Markets. </p>





<p>WHO WE ARE IS MUIR RANCH.</p>





<p>We are a growing teen jobs program that looks like a 2 acre school farm, CSA vegetable social enterprise and catering start up. We have nearly 200 customers, 50 of whom are low income and fully subsidized via a Pasadena Children's Health Foundation grant, that receive the same weekly veg. box as our retail clients. </p>





<p>Our model gives our students at Muir High School the opportunity to run a business. We spend little time as ""nutrition educators"" preaching about the value of kale, kohlrabi and persimmons. But if the kids want to be successful business people they have to know their ""product,"" so they eat it. No drama. No fuss. If you want to work here, eat kale. Michelle Obama would be so proud.</p>





<p>We started our program, not unlike Steve Jobs and that other Steve in a garage, with a vision and just ourselves as customers. Last year one teacher, then a neighbor and then a parent signed up. We had 20 customers our first month. With just under 200 customers currently we spend $6,000 a month on our produce, money for farmers, and we gross $1215,000 per month from our client base. Everyone eats. Everyone. And our $30 weekly box is 50% taxdeductible. </p>





<p>Our vegetable subscription box is a better choice for our students, 90% of whom are on ""free and reduced"" school lunches and food stamps, SNAP. According to the Social Justice Learning Institute, LA families only spend 12% of their federal benefit on fresh fruits and vegetables, i.e. healthy food. Unacceptable. Horrible. And if you are Dr. Jonathon Fielding of LA County Health you can predict the billion dollar health economic impacts of diet on LA in 2050. Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, let alone the selfesteem and physical suffering associated with junk food, fast food and all things ""flaming hot.""</p>





<p>Couple that with the teen unemployment rate in NW Pasadena, Boyle Hts, Crenshaw, Sylmar and Inglewood you can paint a bleak picture. While we are a teaching program with atrisk, low income and other challenged youth and it is about process, we do, however, PRODUCE. As my students say, ""it's expensive being a teenager, Mr. Mud."" A simple paycheck is a game changer for my kids, 90% of whom who have never received one before. The simple dignity of having a phone is something that motivates my kids like no other. </p>





<p>We deliver our CSA to the City of Pasadena Health Dept, City Hall and the school district headquarters. We host open houses on Mondays for our school site pick up. Just having the students meet the customers, take checks, and provide customer service is a game changer. And the clients? They get kale. </p>","My students have iPods and don't wear county ankle bracelets any more. 





Alondra, Jacqui, Perla and Lali, all 1518 yearold students, help manage a 6figure start up: schedule, distribution and payroll.





They steal all the customers champagne grapes during the season. The business part of me cringes. The teacher says, ""go ahead, eat them. they're good for you and the customers don't know they were in the CSA anyway.""





My kids know how to grow a ""green zebra"" tomato.





We won this year's ""Green Curriculum"" award from the Green School Summit. We don't have an actual curriculum. We do have an actual business. As an employer what matters to you???





Not a single case of foodborn illness to date. Knock wood. Clean hands.





We haven't missed a single CSA distribution since launch. Consistency.





50 Lowincome families receive free CSA boxes thanks to the Pasadena Children's Health Foundation. The wait list for other familes is 23 times this.





We have been approved by the USDA for SNAP electronic payments.





We host the LA County Master Gardeners, the largest food justice group in Los Angeles, as of this year. The LA County Master Food Preservers are not far behind.





Amongst Whole Foods' Whole Kids Foundation's 2,000 plus school garden grantees our grant was 5 times the average amount and the only one given in the country as a social enterprise business. The kids are invited to Austin, Texas in 2014 for the national corporate meeting.





We've brought on chef Ernie Miller of the Hollywood Farmers' Market to teach in our semiendowed ""Julia Child Culinary Chair"" as the kids learn to cook chard, kale, lentils and shiso. Yes, shiso.

Within a year we will have obvious successful models and ones that need improvement amongst our 5 new partner sites. IF the satellites can build customers and secure additional funding they will grow. Their financials will paint a picture of the economics. How many jobs? How many customers? Is it sustainable?








Health.





What is the cost of ""being healthy."" What is the cost of not? We can call on our Health Dept partners to measure in avery ""epidemiological"" way the effects of the CSA on the students, staff, and community. 








Beauty.





Kale or asphalt?





","Provide lowincome teens jobs, work experience, socent exposure and fresh, organic veg.

","Currently, there are 5,000 acres of asphalt in LA Unified School District campuses. If we are do be more sustainable, half of that amount could be fruit trees with their shade and apples or gardens with kale. 





The students we teach now will be in their midfifties by then. If they develop an awareness of the natural world and the importance of diet we'll only be in a better world for it. "
3102180,2013180,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MUSEK.html,Empowering students thru arts and education, Education,"â€‹M.U.S.E.K will be used as a curriculum for our students.M.U.S.E.K, which stands for Motivating Underprivileged Students thru Empowerment and Knowledge is a program designed to support students, to help them go to college, particularly those from high needs population, to reach their fullest potential. It also serves to level the playing field for minority and lowincome students, as well as students who may be the first in their families to potentially attend college. TheM.U.S.E.K program serves to support its students by teaching and reinforcing study and organizational skills, encouraging students to take more rigorous and challenging classes, providing college and career counseling; and ultimately preparing them for success at fouryear colleges. M.U.S.E.K  isnot a remedial education program; instead it is a college preparatory  program designed to provide whatever support may be lacking for students who possess academic potential, but who may not be aware of the power that education holds.





NEED STATEMENT


  In todayâ€™s society it is becoming increasingly important for people to successfully complete higher education to be successful in their careers.  However, not all students are being provided the same opportunities in regards to their college preparation.  Research has shown this, as McClafferty, Torres, and Mitchell (2000) state: â€œUrban schools tend to be larger, with fewer resources, and located in areas of higher poverty rates.  The student populations in urban schools are also more likely to be comprised of people of color or of students who have difficulty speaking English.  In addition, children in urban areas are more often exposed to conditions that endanger their health and wellbeing, such as limited access to medical care and increased exposure to violence and crimeâ€ (p.3).  Therefore, it is more difficult for teachers in urban schools to prepare their students for college level courses and the rigor that they entail.


  Furthermore, when students in urban areas are not provided with the resources they need, they often do not meet the A to G requirements, the courses a student needs to have taken to apply for Universities.  To take it a step further students sadly arenâ€™t even thinking about college because they are unaware of its accessibility to them. This failure by teachers and staff to deliver this information to students coupled with a lack of resources is a major problem that students at urban schools face.  As most of the students come from home environments that do not value education, many students are not enthusiastic about attending school, and often do not see value in doing school work.  So, it is important for teachers to reach out and understand their students and the community which they come from.  To do this teachers need to find out all the information they can about students backgrounds as well as getting involved in their lives outside of school and getting parents involved. If students are in a cohesive and safe educational environment which provides them with resources and knowledge of opportunities, students will be more likely to take them and hopefully feel more confident in themselves.  Confidence will allow them to take risks and strive for higher goals, like going to college. The mission of this program is to address the unique needs of the educationally disadvantaged. We whole heartedly believe that every youth, if provided an opportunity at home and school, has the potential tosucceed. These opportunities include access to a quality education, counseling services to youth and the parents about higher education.


  MUSEK will serve those studentsâ€™ grades 9 through 12 who come from one or more of the following high risks groups: Expelled or suspended from home district, Wards of the court or dependents of the court, Pregnant and/or parenting, Recovered Dropouts, Habitually truant or habitually insubordinate and disorderly whose attendance at the school is directed by a school attendance review board or probation officer, Retained more than once in kindergarten through grade eight.


","The program is fairly new and underfunded. However, all students who have been enrolled in  the program for the 20122013 cycle have been accepted to a 4 year university.  These students come from diverse backgrounds. Some students were significantly performing academically below grade level, but were able to thrive while in the program. All of the students are firstgeneration college students, so to watch the students overcome personal obstacles to accomplish academic goals is rewarding. 





This program has shown that it can help students improve their grades by empowering with tools that inspire critical thinking, focus, and organization. Implementing this curriculum has definitely motivated my students to pursue higher education. Not only are they thinking about college but they now understand the skills they must develop to get into college and to succeed in college.








","Due to an ongoing partnership with Soledad Enrichment Action Charter School, it will be relatively simpe to build a clientele base. The school lacks  any programs that promote college education and/or encourages students to race to the top. The school has 17 separate locations totaling 1500 students. 


","Evaluation of the M.U.S.E.K. program will occur through multiple methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial education component a pre and post test will be administered to each participant before and after the program. This evaluative tool will measure learned content from topics discussed from objective 1. In addition to the pre and post test a journal writing prompt will be administer at the last session for participants to reflect about the process of their individual journey. The second method of evaluation will be for objective 2. Students will be given pre and post SAT diagnostic test to chart and assess progress throughout the duration of the program. The final method of evaluation will be for objective 3. Students will be given a pre and post survey assessing their specific interests in music. This will pose as a segue activity that assists students in developing initial ideas for their project. Students will be given pre and post assessments on their knowledge of fundamental music theory, music history and music production. Students will also be given an assessment every Friday to track their progress weekly.","The main goal of the program is to prepare students for a postsecondary degree and ensure that they enroll and graduate from a higher institution of learning. This goal will be accomplished through intense academic preparation and promotion of empowerment.  A supplemental goal of the program is to engage students in a project based learning environment centered on learning communities. Forming learning communities will help students develop interpersonal communication skills. It will afford students the ability to lead as well as work cooperatively in a productive manner with their peers. Project base learning breeds empowerment through ownership. Students are more likely to be engaged when their objectives are organic. The responsibility to ascertain knowledge is transferred from teacher to student placing the teacher in the role of mediator. This act in and of its self whether or notrecognized by the host is psychologically empowering.


OBJECTIVE 1: CONCEPTUALIZE THE ROLE OF COLLEGE


Demystifying higher learning and the negative perceptions associated with being an at risk student applying for college. An extensive foundational (preparation) curriculum has been designed to strengthen studentsâ€™ preparedness and awareness about college. 


ACTIVITIES:  learning modalitiies assessment; highly effective teen workshop 


OBJECTIVE 2: INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT PORTFOLIOS


Focused instruction for SAT testing tailored to meet studentsâ€™individual needs. Instructors use test proven material and address studentsâ€™ learning styles.


ACTIVITIES: SAT workshop including practice tests; Best Practices workshop


OBJECTIVE 3: STRUCTURING CURRCIULUM THAT EMPOWER STUDENTS


Program includes music service learning opportunities that promotes responsibility and empowers adolescents to impact their community. Participants will be given the opportunity to complete an original composition which demonstrates an application of the knowledge attained over the course of the program. The composition will be performed by the student. If students choose not to perform their project must be described extensively in narrative format using the language of music theory, music history, and music productionThe goal of the project is to inspire creativity and empower students.


ACTIVITIES: Music lessons and recording/producing workshop.


OUTCOMES: Students will be accepted to a four year university. ","The methodologies of this program will be adopted county wide. This will create a sense of familiarity within the curriculum that will be beneficial to teachers and students in that the students have a unified set of tools that they use on a daily basis. As I previously mentioned





there are many underperforming students throughout Los Angeles county and the prerequisites. The program needs to be available to a larger percentage of the students in order to be effective.This program has yielded improvements in student performance in the classroom while simultaneously motivating and preparing students for a future in higher education. It has also increased  awareness of the opportunity for students go to college which will ultimately lead to


students becoming eligible to attend college. A county wide employment of this program will not only create a sense of community, but a network for students to utilize in the future."
3102181,2013181,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/GreenKidsLA2050.html,Pavement to Parks, Environmental Quality,"<p>The Idea:</p>


<p>By December 31st, 2013:</p>


<p>â€¢	Transform 10 public paved places (corners of libraries, Boys and Girls Clubs, schools, etc.) to 10 native plant gardens.</p>


<p>â€¢	Give 3 nature programs at each of the 10 new gardens, including citizen science programs like Lost Lizards of Los Angeles.</p>


<p>â€¢	Employ 15 L.A. youth (5 college and 10 high school students) to develop gardens and lead programs. Youth will be mentored by National Park Service rangers.</p>


<p>â€¢	Provide 20 field trips to national parks or other local open space areas for the local community.</p>


<p>â€¢	Provide two overnight, transformative field trips to a national park for the 15 youth interns.</p>


How it impacts the indicator:</p>


<p>â€¢	Adds up to 10 acres of green space and up to 5000 native plants to lowincome, park poor communities in L.A.</p>


<p>â€¢	Creates oxygen. Estimated amount of oxygen produced by plants in gardens = estimated number of leaves per plant (estimate 100) x .005 liters of oxygen per hour/per leaf x 8 hours of sunlight per day x 365 days per year x 25000 plants = 3.64 million liters of oxygen produced per year.</p>


<p>â€¢	Increases biodiversity in the urban landscape.  Species richness of 10 to 30 species per garden.</p>


<p>â€¢	Interactive nature programs for 500 kids. At least one program will be sciencebased and will be a longterm environmental monitoring citizen science project.</p>


<p>â€¢	Develops 20 young environmental leaders. Under mentorship of park rangers and scientists, 20 youth from the community will participate in a continuum of learning and leadership.</p>


<p>â€¢	Addresses nature deficit disorder for 500 kids. Problems caused by nature deficit disorder include fear of and lack of respect for nature, more time with â€œsafeâ€ indoor activities like computer games, structured sports activities rather than imaginative play  all potentially contributing to ADD, depression, child obesity, lower grades, etc.</p>


The Method:</p>


<p>â€¢	Identify target neighborhoods lacking in green space, based on research by City Project and LA2050. Use one month to identify target projects using a threepronged approach: 1) Use Google Earth imagery and other web resources to identify public areas used by kids that have pavement that could convert to garden space.  Meet with these potential places to discuss gardens.  2) Put project request opportunities out to the community via newsletters and the internet asking for project ideas.  3) Meet with community leaders to solicit possible projects.</p>


<p>â€¢	Select projects and have team of site owners (library, school staff, Boys and Girls Clubs) and NPS staff and student interns identify best location for a garden, select species, and layout garden plan (12 months).</p>


<p>â€¢	Have NPS mentors and student interns meet with facility staff and kids to develop program ideas and begin program planning.</p>


<p>â€¢	NPS will utilize plants grown in our native plant nursery.  Other additions such as reading benches, low water using fountains, edible plants, bird boxes, owl boxes, bat boxes, etc. can be added as requested.</p>


<p>â€¢	Install native gardens and initiate garden care with students (1 month).</p>


<p>â€¢	Develop and deliver programs at gardens (35 months).</p>


<p>â€¢	Deliver field trips for garden communities.  Two field trips per garden for a total of 20 field trips.  Field trips will be from L.A. to Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.</p>


<p>â€¢	Take student interns on two longer, indepth, leadershipbuilding field trips, one backpacking trip in the Sierra and one kayaking trip at Channel Islands National Park.</p>


Ripples in the Pond:</p>


<p>â€¢	The more educated you are, the more money you make.  Nature programming and citizen science are exciting ways to engage kids in science and education in general and keep them motivated and wanting to learn.</p>


<p>â€¢	Your chance of becoming a scientist is higher if you decide by age 10 that you might want to be a scientist.  Increasing the diversity of scientists in L.A. and the world as a whole is an ancillary goal of our program.</p>


<p>â€¢	If you want to be math literate as an adult (able to calculate a tip on a restaurant bill, able to see that you receive correct change, etc.) you need to have basic counting and number line skills in place by first grade!  Observing, counting, and measuring nature is an excellent way to start and reinforce this learning.</p>





<p>This is our vision for a green Los Angeles in 2050: green, growing, vibrant, and joyful.  Wonâ€™t you join us?</p>","The staff and volunteers of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area have each year:





â€¢	Reached over 8000 kids with naturebased education programming.


â€¢	Planted 5 acres of native habitat. 


â€¢	Grown 15,000 native plants.


â€¢	Planted 10,000 native with kids.


â€¢	Employed over 20 scientists to conduct scientific research on plants, animals, water quality, air quality and more.  This research includes four active citizen science programs (Whatâ€™s Invasive, California phenology project, crayfish removal).


","We admire the work of the many L.A.based groups currently working to green Los Angeles.  Depending on the specific project areas and program details that we develop with our partner communities, we anticipate opportunities to work with some of these excellent groups.  We already have established working relationships with the following groups that may partner with us on specific garden projects and/or programming under this umbrella project:


â€¢	Los Angeles County Natural History Museum


â€¢	California State Parks


â€¢	Northeast Trees


â€¢	Los Angeles Conservation Corps


â€¢	Los Angeles Unified School District


â€¢	Outward Bound Adventures


 ","â€¢	Number of gardens installed.  Goal=10.


â€¢	Number of acres of garden.   Goal= 3 but could be up to 10 depending on projects.


â€¢	Number of student employees.  Goal= 5.


â€¢	Number of student interns.  Goal= 10.


â€¢	Number of programs delivered.  Goal= 30.


â€¢	Number of students served.  Goal= 500.


â€¢	Estimate of oxygen produced.  Goal= over 3 million liters of oxygen per year.  We will estimate this based on counting leaves and number of plants per garden.


â€¢	Biodiversity increased. Species richness of at least 1030 species per garden (including plants, insects, and other animals).


â€¢	Specific learning objectives will also be developed for each program delivered.  These learning objectives will be evaluated based on participant and community feedback.


","â€¢	Adds up to 10 acres of green space and up to 5000 native plants to lowincome, park poor communities in L.A. 


â€¢	Creates oxygen. Estimated amount of oxygen produced 3.65 million liters of oxygen per year.


â€¢	Increases biodiversity in the urban landscape.  Species richness of 10 to 30 species per garden.


â€¢	Interactive nature programs for 500 kids. At least one program will be sciencebased and will be a longterm environmental monitoring citizen science project.  


â€¢	Develops 20 young environmental leaders. Under mentorship of park rangers and scientists, 20 youth from the community will participate in a continuum of learning and leadership. 


â€¢	Addresses nature deficit disorder for 500 kids. Problems caused by nature deficit disorder include fear of and lack of respect for nature, more time with â€œsafeâ€ indoor activities like computer games, structured sports activities rather than imaginative play  all potentially contributing to ADD, depression, child obesity, lower grades, etc.


â€¢	Increase scientific literacy and educational opportunities for 500 children.  Potentially increase the likelihood of their completing high school, having greater economic outcomes and greater community engagement.


â€¢	Building Community Relationships: This project will enable NPS to strengthen community relationships within Los Angeles and help spread the word on native gardens.  We hope to build upon this project and continue to create more gardens in additional communities once this project is over.


Seeds: The students who will lead this program are future community leaders for Los Angeles.  The students who attend these programs and build their science literacy, ecological literacy, and community connections are also future leaders of Los Angeles.


â€¢	Seeds: These gardens will serve as seeds of community change.  We can make more gardens.  This idea can spread.


â€¢	Seeds: If we build it, they will come.  If we make space in the city for nature, nature will thrive.  


â€¢	Seeds: These plants will literally make seeds.  These seeds can be given away to families, used to guerilla garden medians and neighborhoods, and used to start new gardens. ","â€¢	All children live within Â¼ mile of a park or other green space.


â€¢	Los Angeles is permeable to biodiversity â€“ native plants, insects, birds, and other animals have habitat within the city and are found within the city limits.


â€¢	Air quality is improved to fewer than 20 smog days per year.


â€¢	High school graduation rates are improved.


â€¢	All children have equal access to green space, clean air, clean water, and nature regardless of race, ethnicity, or economic status.

3102182,2013182,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Nativ.html,NativLA: Discover the city you thought you knew , Environmental Quality,"NativLA is a geolocation mobile app that will provide a YELPlike experience for users eager to explore our cityâ€™s wild side. Utilizing photography and video to unveil and document experiences with urban nature, users can share as well as search for experience by region, using categories such as â€œwildlifeâ€, â€œseasonalâ€ and â€œkidfriendlyâ€ as filters.  As a social network, a placebased educational tool and an urban nature guide, NativLA will inspire environmental stewardship and foster a citywide understanding of how nature sustains life. Los Angeles is the place without a sense of place, famous for sprawl and overdevelopment, and defined by its carclogged freeways.  It might seem inhospitable to efforts to connect with nature and community.  But this city is rich in nature's amenities â€” the ocean, mountains, diverse habitats and ecosystems, with a Mediterranean climate.  The City of Los Angeles has 15,710 acres of parkland, including 4,217 acres in Griffith Park, the largest municipal park in the United States.  L.A. has nine lakes and an urban forest of one million trees. Approximately 70 community gardens are growing in Los Angeles County, serving 3,900 families and dozens of commercial urban farms are taking root within city limits. There are three core modes to the NativLA app: Spottings, Nativ Ambassadors and Location Based Field Guilds. Spottings are experiences with nature that can be shared and accessed by everyone.  Snap a photograph or shoot video of a nature activity or wildlife sighting, select the appropriate category, confirm your location, add some descriptive tags or comments and submit it.   In Upper Fryman Canyon, off Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills, a mother and her two sons record a chorus of frogs in the rainswelled stream beneath a Eucalyptus grove.  A torrent of comments follows, which identify the creatures as Southern Mountain YellowLegged Frogs, and claiming that February and March are the best viewing months.  Further east in Hollywoodâ€™s Bronson Park, a guide from Urban Outdoor Skills photographs lush swaths of California sagebrush, mugwort and bay leaves, includes tips on how to gather and preserve them and provides a link to the organization.  In Culver City, a father uploads video of his daughter â€œforagingâ€ for guavas in the trees lining the Ralphs parking lot and, like a true Nativ, cautions her to pick only as much as she can carry.  Nativ Ambassadors are urban farmers, homesteaders and environmental groups such as Los Feliz Eco Village and The Institute for Urban Ecology, who are willing to open their operations to Angelenosatlarge for the purpose of exploration and education.  For example, an urban commercial farm in West LA, called Wybrandt Farm, uploads pictures of their 3,000 square foot vegetable garden, posts information about tours and provides a link to local farmerâ€™s markets where they sell their produce.  In Koreatown, The Los Angeles EcoVillage, designed to demonstrate lower environmental impact and higher quality of living in an urban environment, uploads video of their greywater and solar panel systems with a link to tours (lunch optional) and garden hours.  The Locationbased Field Guide is an opportunity to see what kind of eco adventures are occurring near you and learn more about them. Search through a map view, list view or grid view of recent Spottings and Ambassador posts all based on your location.  You may also search through personalized Field Guides, rated by popularity, in which individuals or organizations have mapped out tours through specific neighborhoods or highlighted â€œbest ofâ€ destinations.  To aid in your search, you can filter by categories to find what you are most interested in.  Categories include: Wildlife, Urban Farming, Foraging, Eco Adventures (adventures in sustainable alternative living i.e. art and design), Farmersâ€™ Markets, Hikes & Walks, Kidfriendly and Seasonal. NativLA Field Trips: Los Angeles has experienced severe cuts in supplemental learning excursions from elementary through high school. Schools used to be able to take children on three district approved field trips per class, per year. Now budget cuts have forced the school to cut out field trips completely. Even the lure of free admission to a venue or experience isnâ€™t enough â€“ teachers have no way of providing transportation since the schools have to pay for the buses. NativLA Field Trips, a component of the LocationBased Field Guild, are built right into the application and web presence, and will allow teachers throughout Los Angeles to access information about free and accessible outings. Teachers will find many activities they can walk to right from school and there will be public transportation routes to NativLA Field Trips taking place across the city. According to the Center for Eco Literacy, placebased learning encourages students to experience the natural world and better understand the places where we live, work and learn. ","Though NativLA does not yet exist, it will coalesce my years of experience with nature and the environment.  While earning a BA in Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I created the show Habitat for UNCCH Cable TV on the abundance of nature found on campus.  I spent summers interning at 60 Minutes, The New York Times and studying with the Wildlands Studies Program through San Francisco State University.  My first job out of college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS affiliate WRALTV in Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed me my first job reporting, at NBC affiliate KIEMTV in Eureka, CA.  As morning and then evening anchor, I wrote, produced and filmed dozens of stories on the local environment, including a threepart special on Coho salmon and their plight, and stories on the headwaters of the old growth coastal redwoods in Humboldt County. After moving to Los Angeles, I wrote and produced nature documentaries for television, including Earthâ€™s Fury, Storm Warning and The Top 10 Environmental Disasters.  When I chose to leave the workforce and start a family, I created my own company called Dutch Touch Art designing and commissioning a series of handpainted oils for the design industry, based on the Netherlandâ€™s Golden Age and their iconic depictions of nature in the wild.  Currently, I am Chair of a nonprofit organization called Friends of Wonderland, which raises over $450K annually for Wonderland Elementary School in Laurel Canyon.  We provide the enrichment programs that Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) no longer funds, including PE, library, music and art.  We also ask, where field trips are concerned, that the parents carpool and pay for all admission fees. ","Partnering with mobile app company Inside.com, NativLAâ€™s unique interface for both mobile and tablet users will be easy to touch, navigate and share.  Core modes such as Spottings and the Locationbased Field Guide will be easy to see and access.  The focus will be on images, icons to represent actions and clean, crisp typography.  There will be easy access to search and sharing features making for a great user experience.

","Success will be measured in three phases: Now, Middle Future and Future





Right now we have a lot of ground to cover, 4,084 square miles to be exact.  This first phase of the project will serve as a proof of concept.  Success will mean a fully developed mobile application and web presence, with an enticing brand and clear message for the citizens of Los Angeles to engage, be informed and interact with their urban nature.  





Right now students all over this city are trapped in classrooms without any field trips on the school calendar. A test run of NativLA Field Trips needs to be activated as part of this initial phase.  By focusing on elementary schools in a test district such as South LA, we will populate the map with nature and wildlife destinations, as well as have Nativ Ambassadors ready to open their urban operations to educate and inspire.   Additionally we will provide the sample online materials that will allow teachers and students to delve deeper into each destination. 





The middle future is to determine the business model that will sustain the project.  Forprofit methods include approaching investors, integrated advertising and charging for each app download.  Another approach will be taking the proof of concept to an existing mobile app company like YELP and pitching the concept as their nonprofit entity.  Nativ could be â€œpowered by Yelpâ€ or something similar. 





In the future, NativLA will serve as a proving ground for an approach to urban nature that will be duplicated in every metropolitan city throughout the United States and the world.   And in combining a full featured webpresence with the mobile app, every user, regardless of their socioeconomic standing, will have complete access to all Nativ has to offer citizenscientists around the globe. 


","According to the LA2050 report, the environment where people live, work and play is a key component of quality of life.  But in the City of L.A., only 8% of the land surface is public parks and only 29% of L.A. residents live within a quartermile of a public park, leaving more than 600,000 children without access.





While the city strives to create more equitable greenspaces, NativLAâ€™s mission will be to connect all Angelenos to urban nature opportunities in every neighborhood in the city, inspiring environmental stewardship and fostering a citywide understanding of how nature sustains life. 





According The Center for Eco Literacy, nature is our teacher, sustainability is a community practice, and sustainable living is rooted in a deep knowledge of place.  





â€œWhen people acquire a deep knowledge of a particular place, they care about what happens to the landscape, creatures, and people in it. When they understand its ecology and diversity, the web of relationships it supports, and the rhythm of its cycles, they develop appreciation and a sense of kinship with their surroundings. Places known deeply are deeply loved, and wellloved places have the best chance to be protected and preserved for future generations.â€ â€“ Center for Eco Literacy


","Every community throughout Los Angeles will have a myriad of userprovided spottings and guides encouraging interaction with our cityâ€™s immense biodiversity.   Placebased learning in the form of Nativ Field Trips will be an integrated part of LAUSD curriculum.





Todayâ€™s Elementary school children raised with NativLA will be fluent in their cityâ€™s diverse natural habitat.  Inspired by community farming, foraging and urban homesteading, this generation will have long benefited from placebased learning and will be a living example of a true Nativ: one who advances environmental stewardship and civic engagement, and who understands there is a unique opportunity to connect with the city every time you walk out your front door. 





Much as YELP provides us with the ability to make spontaneous and often adventurous choices regarding our next meal, allowing us to delve deeper into the various cultures of our cities, Nativ will create stewards of our cityâ€™s natural diversity.  Nativs will shape their days around experiencing urban nature and caring about what happens to the creatures, landscape and people in it. 





â€œWhen they understand its ecology and diversity, the web of relationships it supports, and the rhythm of its cycles, they develop appreciation and a sense of kinship with their surroundings.

3102183,2013183,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/urbansafari.html,NHM Urban Safari, Environmental Quality,"NHM will engage the residents of Los Angeles in an extensive program to discover and document the urban wildlife of the L. A. Basin â€“ our local biodiversity. The environmental challenges facing Los Angeles demand innovative solutions that take into account the complex relationship between us and local plants and wildlife â€“ the relationships that form our rich and diverse urban ecosystem. Los Angeles is actually an extremely biodiverse city. Neither scientists nor the public understand the full breadth of that biodiversity. If we, as a city, can understand the scope of the natural world that surrounds us, we will have an essential part of the toolkit to develop our city thoughtfully.





Los Angeles is in the heart of North Americaâ€™s only biodiversity hotspot (the California Floristic Province). More than 10 million people live here, along with more species of birds than are found in any other county in the U.S.  However, our knowledge of the identities and distributions of smaller species that live here is astonishingly poor. While we know that there are many native, nonnative and invasive species here, there has never been a comprehensive survey of urban biodiversity in L.A. â€“ or any other major metropolis in the world. 





Why is urban biodiversity important? Biodiversity is the sum of all biological diversity living, from ecosystems to genes, representing the ultimate â€œsurvival manual,â€ documenting unbroken lines of evolutionary success from the origin of life on our planet through all previous mass extinctions. To understand how to manage these ecosystems, we need to know who is here so that we can decide together which species to encourage, which to discourage, and how to do so. As the worldâ€™s population becomes more urbanized, our discoveries in Los Angeles can benefit the entire planet.





NHMâ€™s public research projects will empower Angelenos to influence the future of our landscapes, plants and wildlife. We are using the evolving model of doityourself science â€“ generally known as citizen science â€“ to engage the eyes, ears and cameras of Angelenos in the mapping and stewardship of L.Aâ€™s wildlife, the kind that lives all around us but we seldom notice. Angelenos of all ages contribute to this scientific inventory through a variety of mechanisms, from submitting photos to hosting sampling sites in their backyards. Together, our scientists and the public will work together to build placebased strategies for biodiversity conservation that are timely, rooted in local culture and cuttingedge.





NHM has been leading individual citizen science projects for decades. In 1994 we launched the California Parrot Project which tracked feral parrot populations in Southern California. Since then NHM has initiated the LA spider and butterfly surveys, and a ladybug census for the city. We are greatly expanding our urban biodiversity programs to include a regionwide biodiversity map, a number of specific studies, and a threeyear scientific sampling survey of insects and other invertebrates called BioSCAN. NHM is preparing to build on its extensive previous investment in citizen science projects and scale up with a wideranging public information and education campaign that will spur Los Angeles residents to even greater involvement with our urban ecosystems.





Our newest initiative, ZomBee Watch, calls on volunteers to help NHM scientists monitor how parasitic flies lay their eggs in honeybees, causing them to abandon their hives, like zombies, in aimless night flights before dying. Understanding this phenomenon could help explain Colony Collapse Disorder (a syndrome in which worker bees quit their hives) that is threatening the worldâ€™s bee population and the future of our food supply. 





BioSCAN will create a transect survey of the insect populations of Los Angeles. Insects are the largest animal component of biological diversity. They are critical to our economic system. Sampling sites include sites from the urban core into the wild hills, from backyards, parks and schoolyards to industrial sites. Microclimate stations will measure variables like temperature and moisture, data which will be useful to make comparisons about how everyday things like porch lights impact our local wildlife. We fully expect to discover and describe hundreds of species during the course of this study â€“ right here in Los Angeles.





To conduct and facilitate this work we have built a dedicated team of scientists and educators. We are now building an innovative new website called Nature at NHM. Nature at NHM will provide uptotheminute results and information about biodiversity in Los Angeles, connect Angelenos with projects they can participate in, and invite submissions to our BioMap that will provide a longterm view of the flora and fauna of this city as experienced by its residents. This science is critical to our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world, and the spaces we have built to study it are unprecedented.


","NHM is currently in the process of the most dramatic changes in its 100year history. The guiding vision for the $135 million NHM Next Campaign is to bring the Museumâ€™s most important collections and ambitious discoveries out of our science labs to create new visitor experiences that explore the â€œbig pictureâ€ of life on our planet and the interrelatedness of our natural and cultural worlds. We are only four months away from completion of this historic transformation. NHM Next is changing the way we can educate our visitor base. Each year, 200,000 visitors from local schools visit the Museum â€“ more than a quarter of all the students in LAUSD â€“ free of charge. NHM has the most diverse, broadest visitor base of any comparable museum in the Western U.S.


	





Among the seven major exhibitions that comprise NHM Next are the NHM Nature Gardens and Nature Lab. These exhibits form an expansive indooroutdoor interface with the urban wildlife of Los Angeles, a site where visitors and researchers can study biodiversity and environmental change as it happens. Visitors will be able to observe and take part in the scientific process, and to learn valuable lessons about our environment. The Nature Lab will be the Museumâ€™s center for Citizen Science. It is a hub of nature investigation and scientific research outfitted with interactive media and tactile â€œhandsonâ€ experiences to connect the Museumâ€™s exhibits and collections indoors to the â€œraw materialâ€ visitors encounter outdoors. The exhibit will invite visitors to experience the cityâ€™s rich biodiversity and give them a way to contribute to real, ongoing study of our urban ecosystem. 








In addition to the massive physical accomplishments at the Museum, NHM has a team of dozens of researchers, in fields ranging from archaeology to entomology. These worldclass researchers are contributing to academic and scientific discourse every day. NHM researchers are frequently published in the highest echelon of scientific journals. Some recent, notable accomplishments from the Museumâ€™s research and collections department include Project 23, a massive, historic discovery of thousands of Iceage fossils operating in the public eye in Rancho La Brea, in the heart of MidCity Los Angeles; an NSFfunded biodiversity inventory in Costa Rica led by NHM Entomologist Dr. Brian Brown; and the â€œPregnant Plesiosaurâ€ displayed in NHMâ€™s new Dinosaur Hall â€“ NHM paleontologists discovered a perfectly preserved plesiosaur (a 72 million yearold marine reptile) with a fetus inside, that has yielded tremendous scientific knowledge about live birth in these ancient reptiles.








With NHM Next we are setting a new example of how a museum can be a part of the life of a great 21st century city. We will serve as a nature, science and culture destination in the heard of Los Angeles County. It is a transformation unprecedented in our history and designed to set the course for the next hundred years.


","NHM will draw upon many of its existing partnerships to implement our Citizen Science program. USC will base nationallyfunded research projects on the specimens and observations we generate. The California Academy of Sciences will work with NHM to create a statewide citizen science network. The California Science Center will share participant submitted data collected in the Science Centerâ€™s Ecosystems exhibit, and will be a leading member of the regional consortium for citizen science. The Childrenâ€™s Nature Institute will host youth walks in the Nature Gardens and the organization Tree People will lead workshops that will teach visitors how to interact with and understand nature and wildlife that they encounter. ","NHM is seeking to measure the health of our environment by identifying the distribution of species in the Los Angeles area. This information is the basis for broader ecosystem management strategies â€“ informing the development of future parks and open spaces and instilling a sense of environmental responsibility towards our environment. NHM will publish the inventory of species that are discovered and described in peerreviewed scientific journals â€“ providing a clear, tangible research result. We are confident that we will collect and identify many hundreds of species of insects and invertebrates during the study, including dozens of entirely new species never recorded anywhere else. In total, we expect to accumulate at least 60,000 â€œlotsâ€ (small groups of similar specimens) in our permanent collection that can be used by scientists around the world for further research. 





The Museum also will track a host of public learning and participation outcomes as well as formal education initiatives within LAUSD to ensure the projectâ€™s longterm impact. By involving everyday Angelenos in the process of scientific discovery, we will increase scientific literacy among students and adults alike, and increase a sense of stewardship among the residents of this worldclass city and biological hotspot. This is particularly important as we increase by 100,000 the number of schoolchildren we expect to visit annually. NHM has begun implementing tools that will help track success as the project evolves â€“ including baseline surveys that measure interest and knowledge about nature.





We expect that participants will gain: 





1)  A greater interest in science and the environment. By participating in projects in their schoolyards, backyards, parks and open spaces, schoolchildren and citizens of all ages will understand the relevance of science and nature in their lives. 





2) An increase in scientific skills related to the project(s) they are working on. 





3) Deeper knowledge of science and the environment that will contribute to a change in attitude regarding the value of science to our community and larger society. 





4) New, healthier behaviors, especially more time spent outdoors, and engagement in their own communities. Participants will make changes to their own habitats by making their yards more wildlife friendly, by becoming more aware of the impacts of their own habits, and by becoming more involved in local politics. 








NHM will grow existing relationships with LAUSD schools. We are experienced at working with teachers to develop standardscompliant educational materials and curricula. We will target biodiversity and ecosystem awareness, directly affecting not only environmental quality metrics, but education goals as well (a critical area of concern in the LA2050 report). We expect that within the next few years, we will have reached twothirds of LAUSD.


","The pleasure that comes from seeing a hummingbird, hearing a songbird, catching site of a beautiful butterfly, or spying a lizard are well known to rural and suburban dwellers. These experiences are available even in the heart of L.A, where thoughtfully planted pocket parks can quickly attract a rich array of wildlife. Individuals, city planners, school builders and even factories can, with little investment, create biodiverse locations anywhere. This project will make that knowhow widely available. NHM will invite and teach Angelenos to see wildlife and understand what attracts it. By engaging everyone in studying this wildlife, and by making the results of our research widely and easily accessible, we will empower everyone to understand that thoughtful planting, even of a single tree, can make all the difference. 








We now know that we will spend the next century adapting to a changing climate. How we do this in cities is critically important: most people today live in cities. Quality of life depends on environmental quality, which depends not only on chemical and physical parameters, but on ecosystem health. To manage ecosystem health, we must know the players on the stage. We need to know the species that make up our regional biodiversity. Angelenos adapting to a changing climate depend on that knowledge. 








Studies like LA2050 have established that a lack of green space is a detriment to many urban environments. With NHMâ€™s Citizen Science programs, we can document the existing wildlife corridors in our city and provide planners, park designers and community members vital information that can help inform park construction, development and community programming well into the future. NHMâ€™s Citizen Science program elevates open spaces and parks from recreational areas to legitimate biological habitats where ongoing study of our natural world can take place.








We reclaimed 3Â½ acres of parking lot to create a giant living laboratory and field site for the study of local wildlife in our South Los Angeles front yard. Visitors step off the Expo Line train into an oasis of L.A. nature and biodiversity in the heart of the city. Our Nature Gardens have been designed by renowned landscape architect Mia Lehrer, and seeded with dozens of plants and landscape features native to the area. It is growing into a habitat representative of wild Los Angeles. Accompanying the Nature Gardens is the 6,000 sq. ft. Nature Lab where visitors can both report and study L.A. wildlife and its distribution in their neighborhoods and across the city. 


","The vision of the Natural History Museum is that by 2050 all levels of decision makers in Los Angeles will incorporate biodiversity considerations into their development plans.  We will choose street trees and park plants partly for their biodiversity habitat value. We will consider wildlife corridor value on new transportation rightofways, and do away with toxic lawn chemicals, replacing them with plants that attract beneficial bugs that help keep plants healthy. We will be a city committed to developing in a way that is always aware of the biodiversity that surrounds us. Eventually, we want tourists to visit Los Angeles not only for Disneyland and Hollywood, but to see and experience a worldclass, cosmopolitan city that treasures and protects its biodiversity. Places like NHMâ€™s Nature Gardens, the Los Angeles River, and Griffith Park will become destinations for understanding and viewing the way that largescale human development and wildlife can coexist. 








It is critical that Angelenos as a whole be engaged in the process of understanding our local biodiversity. NHM will lead the way in modifying urban development to take better advantage of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This has to happen as a partnership between research professionals, environmentallyaware citizens, and governmental policy makers. Engaging the public in the discovery of our biodiversity will clear a path to creating an environmentallyaware social matrix.








This biological inventory of L.A. nature, undertaken by NHM in concert with our local community, will change the way we live â€“ creating a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the oftenoverlooked nature of L.A. The plants we put in our gardens, the light bulbs we use in our outdoor fixtures, the permeability of our driveways, the distance we live from a park â€“ residents will come to understand that all of these choices affect the health of our urban ecosystem, and in turn, the global ecosystem. 








NHM will help Los Angeles become a beacon city for the management of biodiversity, food supply and air and water quality in the face of global warming and other environmental challenges. With our Citizen Science projects, we hope to systematically train our visitors to observe and understand the wildlife that exists in every part of our environment. By tuning in to these everyday observations, in our own neighborhoods and favorite places, our citizens will learn to see environmental change as it is happening and to make small changes to create the city we want â€“ the future we want.

Neighborhood Youth Association (NYA) believes that education has the power to transform lives, families and communities; that when we invest in educating our youth, we are investing in a better future for all of us.   NYA is building that better future, one life at a time.  





One in four LAUSD students will not graduate from high school; only 48% score as proficient in English on standardized tests; and only 46% score as proficient in math.  At NYA, 80% of NYA students significantly improve their math and English skills each year and 100% of high school seniors graduate on time and go on to college! Most are the first in their families to go to college.  





NYAâ€™s Personal Best program picks up where schools leave off, providing low income and atrisk youth with rigorous, individualized academic and social support during the afterschool hours.  Beyond high school, NYA provides a range of support services designed to ensure that disadvantaged and first generation college students complete their degrees.  Youth can start with NYA as early as first grade and continue all the way through college.





Of the nearly 200 young people currently served by NYA, 99% are Latino, 1% are African American, 92% do not speak English at home, 98% are being raised by a parent or parents who did not attend college, and all are low income.  Despite these challenges, NYAâ€™s students and alumni remain committed to their education. Some travel as many as three hours each way by bus to attend a university.  These young people know that they are building a better future for themselves and for their families. 





â€œI have to set the example and by going to college I can show my siblings that it is possible to accomplish their goals if they strive towards them and put in the effort.â€ â€“ NYA high school senior 





NYA has developed, tested and tracked a highly successful proprietary curriculum.  NYAâ€™s Personal Best curriculum stresses the development of strong math and English skills, STEM literacy, college planning and preparation, critical thinking, and leadership.  Each student undergoes an extensive academic and social assessment.   Targeted interventions such as oneonone tutoring or counseling are integrated into each studentâ€™s â€œafterschool dayâ€ along with activities such as projectbased learning, group activities, competitions, peer mentoring and learning games.  Studentsâ€™ progress toward academic goals is evaluated as often as every week and adjustments are made as needed to ensure that each student receives the support they need to achieve success. 





â€œWhether it may be academically or personally, NYA is a place where knowledge is cultivated and encouraged to flourish.  Being a part of the program has been very impactful to me, and I will take everything I learned at NYA with me, because it has shaped me into a better personâ€. â€“ NYA high school senior","In June of 2012 for the fifth year in a row, 100% of NYAâ€™s seniors graduated high school on time and went on to college!  Most are among the first in their families to attend college!  In addition to California State Universities and Universities of California campuses, NYA Alumni currently attend Macalester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Mount Holyoke, and many other prestigious colleges in California and throughout the country. Three of NYAâ€™s students have been recognized by the Gates Millennium Scholarship Program, including one winner and two finalists.  





Each year, NYA awards college scholarship funds of between $500 to $2,500 to its best performing students and Alumni based on their academic achievements, participation in extracurricular activities, communication skills and demonstrated ability to overcome personal challenges.  At the most recent annual Scholarship and Community Service Awards Dinner in March of 2013, NYA awarded scholarships to 23 students â€“ more than in any other year!  Over the last thirty years, NYA has awarded over 175 college scholarships to its students.  





Additionally, as many as half of NYAâ€™s alumni who remain in the Los Angeles area after high school, return to the program as volunteers.  Alumni volunteers set an example for younger students and help guide the way for the next generation of youth to graduate from high school, succeed in college and transition into meaningful careers. 


","NYA augments both program delivery and staff training through key partnerships with schools, businesses and other nonprofit organizations as well as participation in professional associations. Some of these community partners include the City Scholars Foundation, Jumpstart, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the Mar Vista Farmers Market, Pepperdine Business School, Revolution Prep, St. John's Child and Family Development Center, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Southern California (USC) and Westside Children's Center. These are in addition to NYAâ€™s partnerships with affordable housing developers (Century Housing and Meta Housing Corporation). ","Please explain how you will evaluate your project.  How will you measure success? 


NYA will evaluate the success of its program on students with the metrics below:  


Over 80% of NYA students in grades 112 will demonstrate improved math and/or English skills;


100% of NYAâ€™s high school seniors will graduate from high school on time;


100% of NYAâ€™s high school graduates will pursue postsecondary education at a fouryear university. 


Over 95% of NYAâ€™s college students will make significant progress toward achievement of a baccalaureate degree.  





NYA will measure the success of its expansion by the number of affordable housing sites at which the program is established. NYA will establish two additional sites in 2013 and three more in 2014.    


","â€œMy dream is to contribute to the work NYA does and pave a way for underprivileged students to go to collegeâ€¦.â€ Carol, NYA Alumna & Sophomore, Macalaster College





Youth who do not complete high school will earn less over their course of their lives; are more dependent upon welfare programs; experience higher risk of serious illness and increased rates of drug use and violent crime.  When a young person drops out of school, the long term negative effects are borne not just by the student but by the entire community.  





The strength and success of NYAâ€™s Personal Best program has been proven.  Los Angelesâ€™ high dropout rate demonstrates the massive need for this level of individualized academic support.  NYAâ€™s Mar Vista/Venice program facility can only accommodate 100 students, yet there are thousands of youth throughout Los Angeles who need the Personal Best program.  To expand studentsâ€™ access to this support, NYA entered into an innovative partnership with affordable housing developers, who are required to provide specific services on site for their residents.  Through this partnership, NYA has established three satellite program sites on the campuses of affordable housing developments in some of Los Angeles poorest and most underserved neighborhoods in Downtown, MidCity and South Los Angeles.  In March of 2013, NYA awarded its first college scholarships to satellite site students. Now entering year four of this pilot partnership, NYA has proven the replicability of the program and is ready to expand even further and help more youth in more neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles. 





Working with current affordable housing partners, NYA has identified over 350 affordable housing developments targeting over 20,000 low and moderate income families throughout the greater Los Angeles Area. In 2013, NYA will bring the program to two new satellite sites and three more in 2014.  Each year, NYA will continue to add more satellite sites throughout Los Angeles. In this way, NYA will continue to expand, helping hundreds and eventually thousands of youth make their college dreams come true. 


","NYA envisions a future in which every young person has access to the individualized academic support they need to succeed in school, from elementary school through high school and beyond.  Success in 2050 would mean that every student, regardless of their socioeconomic status, their neighborhood or their parentsâ€™ highest level of schooling, finishes high school and is able to complete a baccalaureate degree. 





Education is the surest pathway out of poverty.  With increased academic achievement comes increased employability as well as increased income and financial stability.   These positive impacts will ripple out from the individual to the community, making Los Angeles a healthier and more prosperous place for everyone.

3102185,2013185,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Project10.html,Project 10: Tithing Urban Harvests Growing Community Food Security, Environmental Quality,"<p>Project 10 is a cooperative effort among two faithbased networks in Los Angeles designed to leverage our shared values of justice, charity, and community and tap the potential of faithbased institutions in the urban sustainability movement. Through Project 10, we envision that faithbased institutions convert 10% of their unused land into urban orchards, producing large amounts of healthy, sustainably grown food and and creating community hubs for engagement and education around local food issues. Project 10 will work with these institutions to develop urban orchards on their properties and cultivate an interfaith network that capitalizes on the values, resources, and infrastructure of the faith community.</p>


<p>In L.A.â€™s growing urban sustainability movement that includes nonprofit, governmental, and private partners and focuses on a diverse set of issues, we believe that faithbased institutions are a vital but untapped ally. Among the large geographic, economic, social, and racial differences in this region, faithbased institutions serve as anchors in every community. According to the American Community Survey in 2007, there were more than 6,000 faithbased congregations in Los Angeles County, representing a membership of 2.3 million people (about a quarter of the population).(1)</p>                                                                                                               


<p>The collaboration of Netiya and Seeds of Hope through Project 10 draws on this untapped power of faithbased institutions to focus on urban greening and local food systems through developing urban orchards on our landholdings. As faithbased networks, Netiya and Seeds of Hope currently engage and mobilize our constituencies around food justice. As a combined network of close to 250 institutions, we are able to access land, money, and volunteers from institutions that have established organizational structures in place. Project 10 will offer institutions with deeply rooted and, in many cases, shared ethics, an opportunity to become powerfully aligned with one another and with partners across other sectors to move elements of entrenched food systems into new configurations.</p>


<p>Project 10 is based on a very simple idea rooted in most major religions: tithing harvests. Tithing is the act of donating 10% of oneâ€™s resources to address the needs of the underserved within and around our communities.  Currently, 10% of Angelenos are food insecure. Consider what it will look like when 10% of LAâ€™s religious institutions convert 10% of their unused institutional land into productive orchards and donate at least 90% of the crop to help feed insecure Angelenos.  By 2050, Project 10 will have provided over 23 million servings of fresh fruits and nuts to our neighbors in need, as part of a larger movement to address food insecurity in the region. By 2050, this project will have contributed approximately 50 acres of new open space to our communities that will have removed more than 4,500 tons of CO2 from our atmosphere, conserved 2.3 billion gallons of water through reduced irrigation, and prevented 185 million gallons of storm water from running off into our oceans.</p>


<p>To demonstrate the viability of our 2050 vision, in 2013 Netiya and Seeds of Hope will collaborate in using Goldhirsh grant funds to:</p>


<p>1) Develop three pilot orchard projects at three faithbased institutions representing geographic, religious, socioeconomic, and landuse diversity.</p>


<p>2) Initiate largescale interfaith awarenessbuilding efforts through institutional engagement, including:</p>


<p>2a) Convene a oneday, interfaith food awareness conference targeted toward religious and lay leaders across institutions, building upon the Seeds of Hope conference planned for May 2013. This will target the more than 200 institutions of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles and Netiyaâ€™s 32member network.</p>


<p>2b) Build out an â€œInterfaith Councilâ€ that will meet regularly to collaborate and support ongoing food production efforts, building upon Netiyaâ€™s successful model Council.</p>


<p>3) Develop and distribute an â€œInterfaith Resource Guideâ€ to help institutions plant and maintain orchards on their properties and contribute the produce to community food pantries.</p>


<p>4) Engage congregants in building awareness around local food and hunger issues through education and outreach programs.</p>


<p></p>


<p>(1) Not all congregations have access to land, as many share facilities. For the purposes of this project we estimate that 5,000 institutions exist in Los Angeles County.</p>","Netiya is an interfaith network that advances urban agriculture through 32 faithbased institutions in Los Angeles. Netiya cultivates gardens to tithe nutritious food and build community food security, and organizes community to seed a more just and resilient local food system. Netiya's objectives are to address food insecurity proactively, and to organize around the ethics of our institutionalscale food choices.





<p>Netiya's Just Gardens program converts unused land at our institutions, and teaches how to grow and tithe nutritious food sustainably. Netiya then trains these communities to sustain Just Gardens from seeding through tithing. Since March 2011, Netiya has installed eight sustainable Just Gardens & runs over 40 community events a year in LA. Netiya will complete two new Just Garden installs in 2013.





<p>Netiya's Just Foods program teaches our institutions to make informed and ethical food choices about procuring food, and distributing leftover or communitygrown food. We strive to forge alliances to source food from LA's local farms with intent to place purchasing power from our 32institution network behind our local farms. Just Foods has launched the Netiya Council to enhance collaboration between our network institutions. It functions to collaboratively produce campaigns, events and educational materials.





<p>Seeds of Hope is a network of more than 200 institutions within the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles committed to the physical and spiritual wellness of individuals and communities. The Diocese currently has more than 30 community gardens, school gardens, and small farms producing fresh produce for distribution to food insecure individuals and families through its more than 40 food pantries and 50 feeding programs.





<p>Seeds of Hope combines and coordinates these efforts in a way that leverages their collective strengths. Individuals and institutions can access books and a website of resources to guide participants on these topics as well, each prepared by network participants on topics of community gardens, edible landscaping, and urban farming and can take advantage of more that 30 training opportunities in the Diocese each year around specific topics from soil preparation to pruning and harvesting.





<p>Seeds of Hope Executive Director Tim Alderson was the founding chairman of the California School Garden Network, which provides the structural model for Project 10. CSGN was created as a network of more than 40 organizations from the public and private sectors, who, despite their disparate and sometimes conflicting agendas, all shared a common interest in instructional school gardens. CSGN works to coordinate the efforts of these various organization in support of school gardens throughout California. The network has funded over 4,000 school gardens, developed extensive training for educators, and created lesson plans aligned to the state standards for teaching all core subjects, K through 12,  in a garden setting.","Identified partners include the Prince of Peace Episcopal Church and the West Valley Food Pantry, which will pilot a new orchard and the direct orchardtopantry model. Potential partners may come from the public or private sector; corporations, academia, water agencies, food and environmental nonprofits, and workforce development agencies. We would specifically expect to engage UC Master Gardeners, Food Forward, Tree People, the Million Trees Initiative, the Yale Urban Resources Initiative, and food pantries. We will bring in community organizations and youth groups to help start up and manage the orchards in their local neighborhoods, potentially establishing a new community hub in areas with limited access to fresh food and open space.","<p>Number of institutions.</p>


<p>Our goal is to have 500 faithbased institutions participating by 2050 with an average of ten trees planted at each property.</p>


<p>Number of faith traditions.</p>


<p>Our goal is to have all major faith traditions in the county represented by 2050. Our first three pilot projects in 2013 will involve Jewish, Muslim, & Christian congregations.</p>


<p>Geographic distribution.</p>


<p>Our goal is to have a positive impact on the health of individuals & the environment throughout every region in the county. We will quantify the geographic distribution of our orchards with particular interest in areas of greater food insecurity & environmental stresses.</p>


<p>Demographic diversity.</p>


<p>We aim to involve Angelenos of every cultural, ethnic, & socioeconomic background. We will quantify success by comparing our participants with the overall diversity of LA.


<p>Acreage converted.</p>


<p>Each orchard will be measured & added to the total to identify whether we will meet or exceed our goal of converting 50 acres to open space.</p>


<p>Trees planted.</p>


<p>Our goal is to plant 5,000 fruit & nut trees by 2050. Trees planted will be inventoried using GPS coordinates & tracked carefully for their positive impacts on the environment & food production.</p>


<p>Servings of fruit grown & distributed.</p>


<p>We project that each tree planted will produce approximately 125 servings of fruit or nuts each year for a potential total of more than 23 million servings. We will carefully quantify each harvest to measure our success.</p>


<p>People served.</p>


<p>Produce from our orchards will be distributed to neighbors in need through our volunteer network, & local food pantries. The amount of fruit or nuts distributed to each recipient will be recorded to track how many people are served.</p>


<p>Pollutants removed from the air.</p>


<p>Each tree has the potential to remove approximately 50 pounds per year of CO2 from the atmosphere. This could amount to over 4,500 tons of CO2 removed from our air by 2050. In partnership with the Urban Resources Initiative at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, using their technology we will precisely measure the amount of pollutants each tree removes from the surrounding air.</p>


<p>Water saved.</p>


<p>Before converting a property to orchard production, we will record the water consumption for its prior use. After conversion, water usage will be documented to determine water savings.</p>


<p>Volunteers participating.</p>


<p>Community involvement is a key determiner of the sustainability. We will quantify the number of congregations & participants over time & the average length of personal engagement. We will also look for indicators to predict a personâ€™s willingness or resistance to participation & motivators for longterm involvement.</p>


<p>Additional, somewhat less quantifiable impacts such as stormwater runoff & decreases in temperature will also be observed.</p>","<p>Project 10 recognizes its place in a much larger urban sustainability movement in Los Angeles that is providing environmental, economic, and social benefits to Angelenos. Project 10 is part of the much larger urban greening, local food production, and food justice movements.  By engaging powerful faithbased allies across the city in planting urban orchards, Project 10 will amplify the benefits of tree planting for food, creating positive effects that will last for decades.</p>





<p>Converting the unused land from faithbased institutions into productive green space will increase urban green areas and bring about related environmental benefits. These include temperature reduction, energy conservation, a reduction in the number of smog and red alert days, improved water quality, and sequestering of greenhouse gases. In particular, there is an acute awareness of the need for more green space in lowincome urban environments. In this way, Project 10â€™s approach can have a particularly strong effect on the health of these communities, as religious institutions are very strong players and can become a starting point for cultivating new and improving access to green spaces.</p>





<p>Project 10â€™s other benefits result from shifting towards local sustainable food systems, as a response to food safety and food access issues, as well as national epidemics of hunger and obesity.  The focus on planting urban orchards is intentional, as we assert that urban orchards can have a much more significant effect on the longterm food system than annual vegetable gardens. Once established and producing, orchards can produce food for decades, and, in the case of nut trees, can produce healthy food with high caloric value. Orchards are also significantly easier to maintain once established, need far less material (compost, mulch, plastic irrigation supplies), water, and labor than annual gardens, and many orchards will just produce food even if they are left alone for years. And Project 10 is designed to take advantage of existing gleaning networks in Los Angeles that already work on private and public orchards to provide food to local pantries.</p>





<p>By 2050 we will:


Create 50 acres of new urban green space


Improve community health, particularly among the â€œfood insecureâ€ by adding over 23 million servings of fresh fruits and nuts to local food pantries.


Remove 4,500 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere


Reduce storm water runoff by 185 million gallons


Conserve 2.3 billion gallons of water (by converting turf and ornamentals to trees)


Improve LAâ€™s water quality by capturing and slowing water at our institutions so it percolates into underground aquifers.


Improve the quality of life in our communities by improving food access in and around our geographicallydiverse congregations, decreasing air pollution, noise, temperatures, and increasing property values.


Help reduce medical costs associated with obesity, diabetes, and smogrelated diseases.</p>","<p>LA in 2050, after running Project 10 for several decades, will boast perhaps one of the countryâ€™s first integrated local food systems that tangibly reduces hunger in the city. Urban orchards flourish in institutions and the backyards of individuals and 90% of their harvest is donated back to the community through local food pantries. Interfaith Youth Corps serve as orchardists and take on other roles in support of institutions establishing Project 10 throughout LA county.</p>  





<p>Success in the year 2050 is when 10% of the faithbased institutions in Los Angeles have dedicated 10% of their unused land towards cultivating urban orchards that help filter and clean the air, improve the soilâ€™s water retention, decrease polluted runoff from entering the ocean, and provide verdant patches of paradise throughout the city for all people to enjoy.  If successful, faithbased institutions will play their part by producing food, providing green space and galvanizing communities to actively take a role in transforming the current food system. There is active, engaged volunteership within faithbased institutions around transforming the food system. This will involve establishing and building up strong links between faithbased institutions to produce food, mobilize communities, and constitute/sustain/organize our networks. The faithbased institutions have solidified partnerships across the corporate and nonprofit sectors, (including Master Gardeners, MG Orchard Team, other gleaning institutions, tree planting organizations, pantries, food justice organizations, workforce development, and local government collaborators) to advance this vision.</p>"
3102186,2013186,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/nftela.html,Innovation Saturday for Los Angeles Youth, Income & Employment,"Together with our partners, NFTE Greater Los Angeles proposes to address youth unemployment in the African American and Latino communities, by creating a youth entrepreneurship and innovation conference for 300 youth, to be held at USC in partnership with USC Marshallâ€™s Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The event will reach underserved Los Angeles teens with the goal of promoting youth entrepreneurship in the face of high unemployment rates for African American and Latino youth in lowincome neighborhoods. 


The conference will be held on Innovation Saturday in Fall 2013 in tandem with NFTEâ€™s World Series of Innovation, a competition designed to challenge teens to solve realworld business problems posed by companies like CocaCola, Microsoft, JC Penney, Sean John, and others. Students who attend the conference will participate in sessions led by diverse LA entrepreneurs who will share the entrepreneurial lessons they have learned. Youth will also work with a team of established entrepreneurs and their fellow teens to launch a project to submit to the World Series of Innovation. Featured conference speakers will include young African American and Latino entrepreneurs and innovators in Los Angeles, introducing underserved LA youth to the growing community of diverse innovators in Los Angeles shaping the business climate in LA.  





The stories shared by entrepreneurs at this event will be documented on video, and shared with the broader Los Angeles community through a webbased library of entrepreneurial stories, in the model of Ted talks, thus affecting the wider LA community of youth seeking economic opportunities. 





This project can impact the income and employment outlook for these youth by introducing them to an alternative vision for generating income to support their life goals, inspiring them with the stories of entrepreneurs who reflect their communities, and sharing resources that can assist them on an entrepreneurial path.


","â€¢	NFTE Greater LA celebrated our 5th Anniversary in 2012.  Since our launch, we have trained over 6,000 of our cityâ€™s hardesttoreach students in our rigorous entrepreneurship curriculum.  By the end of this school year, we will have reached a cumulative total of 7,800 local youth. (April 2012)





â€¢	Out of over 20,000 NFTE students across the country, NFTE Greater LA students have won our National Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge three out of the past 4 years, winning both First and Second Place in 2011:


o	First Place: Kalief Rollins â€œPhree Kountry Clothingâ€ (2009)


o	First Place: Hayley Hoverter â€œSweet (dis)SOLVEâ€ (2011)


o	Second Place: Shomari Patterson â€œShamazzleâ€™s Dazzlesâ€ (2011)


o	First Place: Vincent Quigg â€œTech Worldâ€ (2012)





â€¢	Our Advisory Board Chair Jeff Green was honored with NFTEâ€™s Lowell B. Mason Volunteer of the Year Award for exemplary service. (April 2012)





â€¢	During 2012, NFTE Greater LA embarked on a Strategic Planning process for FY13FY15 which included an assessment of our current situation, outreach to our communities for feedback, and the creation of strategic priorities as we move forward. This process culminated in a Strategic Planning Retreat, where participants weighed in on our initiatives and engaged in creating our case for support and picture of success.  We look forward to utilizing this grander vision as a guide to building a more impactful organization in the years to come.  In November, we were awarded a Strategic Scorecard Grant from the Taproot Foundation to better enable us to track our success. (2012)





â€¢	Due to an anchor gift from one of our funders, we were able to expand our program enrollment and build capacity by growing our NFTE Greater LA Team to 4 fulltime staff, and 4 consultants, as well as embark on a research project to assess our impact on LA youth. (October 2012)


","Our strategic partner, USCâ€™s Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, as well as The American Dream Revised, will work with us on this project. Should we receive funding, we will seek support from Young Presidentsâ€™ Organization (YPO), Entrepreneursâ€™ Organization (EO), USC Society & Business Lab, UCLA Andersonâ€™s Price Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, the LA Chamber of Commerce, LAâ€™s AfricanAmerican Chamber, LA Hispanic Chamber, Amplify, IdeaLab, The Hub LA and NAWBOLA to actualize our project.","In order to measure the value of our conference for the youth involved, we will collect preand postsurvey data, gathering feedback on what they learned from the conference and how useful they found it in informing them about entrepreneurship opportunities that are available to them. We will seek feedback from our conference presenters, as well as our partners, in order to document successes and gather feedback for future improvements. We will be able to monitor the use of our video library and encourage our community of supporters to promote the resource among their networks. ","There is an exciting groundswell of entrepreneurship and innovation in Los Angeles that must be extended to our cityâ€™s low income youth. Youth in Los Angeles who live in underresourced neighborhoods suffer at the crossroads of two major crises affecting our city: the education crisis and the economic crisis. These crises disproportionately affect our city's AfricanAmerican and Latino communities, who bear the burden of struggling schools and a depressed local economy, where better paying employment is difficult to find. When a segment of our population is cut off from full participation in the economy, the broader community suffers.





A youth innovation conference specifically targeting our lowincome youth works at the intersection of these crises to provide a fresh outlook for youth confronted by their communityâ€™s challenges. By directing resources and opportunities toward these underserved youth, our goal is to educate and motivate students to adopt an entrepreneurial vision for their own future. This conference will introduce students to  the skills necessary for entrepreneurship (project planning, future forecasting, opportunity recognition, financial planning, public speaking, negotiating), and our digital library of resources will serve as a lasting source of information to enable our youth  to think beyond their environment and to pursue opportunities that help them realize their full potential.


","In 2050, our vision is that selfemployment for youth in lowincome communities exists as a recognized and viable alternative to seeking a traditional job, and youth unemployment rates have declined significantly. Meaningful educational tools, seed funding, mentorship and role models are readily available to youth in lowincome communities who wish to pursue an entrepreneurial path."
3102187,2013187,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LACivicLab.html,LA Civic Engagement Lab, Social Connectedness,"<p>The National Day of Civic Hacking (NDCH) is a national event, sponsored by the White House, taking place in over 50 cities across the country on June 1st and 2nd. It gives citizens an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our society. We plan to kick off the National Day of Hacking with an event focused not on coding, but rather on developing ideas and prototypes to make government transparency efforts lead to better civic engagement. Community ideas and prototypes could range from things as simple as better signage for navigating City Hall and government offices, to developing a system that alerts the public when particular issues of personal concern appear before City Council. </p>








<p>This event is a creative, productive, and exciting way for Los Angelenos to volunteer while promoting civic and social engagement. Our target audience for NDCH is local government officials in cities throughout Los Angeles County, community leaders, citizen hacktivists, designers, and ordinary residents interested in finding ways to make local governmental transparency meaningful and engaging for the people of Los Angeles.</p>








<p>Over the three months following the NDCH, CA Civic Innovation (CCIP) staff will lead small workshops at which community members and local government staffers will more fully develop and vet prototypes in preparation for their use within government. The CCIP will work with local governments to implement the concepts, whether they be process improvements, technologies, or policies aimed at improving civic engagement through transparency. </p>








<p>Phase 1: National Day of Civic Hacking Event  LA Civic Lab launch (June 1, 2013)</p>


<p>The event will bring together participants from various sectors to collaborate on idea generation and prototyping civic tools to make government more transparent and engaging. Civic tools can range from policy improvements aimed at making information more engaging, to participatory projects like participatory budgeting, and could also include technology to easily enable collaborative writing of rules, policies, or guides. We expect that a variety of ideas and prototypes will surface that reflect the needs and desires of the community, and these tools will not be limited to only technology solutions.</p>








<p>Phase 2: Prototyping Workshops (June  August 2013)</p>


<p>Three to five small workshops will be held in Los Angeles to fully develop ideas and prototypes generated during the NDCH event. The workshops will be small scale, handson, two or three hour sessions.  Teams or individuals that developed prototypes will receive and provide feedback, mentoring, and any additional support they might need. The goal is to ensure that the prototypes meet the needs of the community and can be supported by local governments. Prototypes resulting from the NDCH could include draft amendments to local policies, or a new SMS tool to connect neighbors and send alerts. Because of the short time frame, we do not expect fully functional, featurerich tools to emerge from this process, but we will aim for prototypes that can be tested by local governments and residents.</p>








<p>Phase 3: Implement in Los Angeles County (September  November 2013)</p>


<p>CCIP will select two or three cities within Los Angeles County to implement the community prototypes. To ensure the projects represent community needs, the CCIP hopes to work closely with community members, organizations like Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE) and the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, and the local government prior, during and post implementation.</p>








<p>Phase 4: Best Practices Reporting (December 2013)</p>


<p>This initiative will stimulate new collaboration by community stakeholders in the exploration and adoption of new civic tools, so documenting the best practices and other learnings from the process is of value to the region internally and externally. The projectâ€™s best practices will also be shared through the CCIPâ€™s network of local governments and community organizations throughout California, and through existing networks of local government professional associations, in hopes that the model can be adapted to other communities. The visually engaging report will be released at the conclusion of the project. </p>








<p>Social connectedness is a determinant of a community's quality of life, and bringing people together to share ideas, ask questions, and cocreate has the potential to establish long lasting relationships beyond the initial gathering. By creating a space where local government staff and the community can interact and collaborate, the NDCH event will lead to stronger networks between residents and government, resulting in longerterm civic and social engagement.</p>","<p>The CCIP aims to diffuse innovation in California local governments through researching and recommending organizational and emerging practices that enable the creation and adoption of innovative policies, technology, and programs that deepen community engagement and accelerate civic innovation. Our research and practical exploration aim to breakdown barriers to innovation within municipalities, allowing for deeper relationships between residents and government.</p>





<p>CCIP launched in April 2012, and in our first year we have assembled a team of staff, interns, advisors, and partners that are dedicated to supporting CCIP in achieving longterm sustainability and changing the way California local governments work in order to be more responsive to their residents, enhancing social connectedness..</p>





<p>Major project accomplishments include:</p>





<p> In 2012, Vallejo, California launched the first citywide participatory budgeting process in the United States. The City of Vallejo will invite residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue. Through a yearlong PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens.  CCIP serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>





<p> In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of methodologies  from conversations with experts on networks and city administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California. Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>","<p>The CCIP will leverage partnerships with local community groups for outreach and participation in the National Day of Hacking event. As a grantee of the James Irvine Foundation, we will reach out to other grantees in the Los Angeles area to ensure we are inclusive in outreach and partnerships. In addition, we will seek input and participation from municipalities within Los Angeles County and anchor organizations like the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment.</p>





<p>In addition, the New America Foundation has an existing partnership with Zocalo Public Square, a notforprofit daily Ideas Exchange that blends live events and humanities journalism, based in Santa Monica, CA.</p>","<p>The ultimate outcome of the Civic Lab will be an increase in civic participation in communities throughout Los Angeles and attendant improvements in the ability of residents to impact local decisionmaking.  This will be realized through a number of intermediate outcomes that comprise an increase in capacity and connections among stakeholders throughout Los Angeles. </p>


 


<p>The specific intermediate outcomes that we expect from the Civic Lab that will foster participation and better decisionmaking are:</p>





<p> Increased avenues for participation through new user friendly tools and government processes that dovetail with those tools</p>


<p> Greater amount of knowledge and skills regarding the use and value of tools and processes for civic innovation among both residents and local leaders</p>


<p> Enhanced crosssector relationships among stakeholders working to improve civic life in Los Angeles communities</p>


<p> A new template for collaborative, regional civic innovation through the this project model</p>





<p>Key Metrics:


National Day of Civic Hacking Event</p>


<p> Reach: At least 100 participants, including local government employees, community members, community leaders, businesses</p>


<p> Engagement: Small working groups will form around topics/ ideas. These groups will persist beyond the initial event and work together in the subsequent workshops.</p>


<p> Policy/Influence: Commitment from two local governments to adopt a solution designed during the event.</p>





<p>Prototyping Workshops</p>


<p> Reach: Three to five workshops within the county that provide space, mentoring, and feedback for teams continuing to prototype solutions</p>


<p> Engagement: At least 20 community members and other stakeholders engaged in the workshops over the course of three months</p>


<p> Policy/ Influence: Five new community projects resulting from the workshops. Not all of these will be implemented within local government; some will remain community driven projects.</p>





<p>Community Engagement Prototypes</p>


<p> Reach: Two projects will be tested in cities within Los Angeles County.</p>


<p> Engagement: The collaborative nature of the projects will ensure the prototypes tested by cities reflect community engagement needs and fit within governmentâ€™s scope.</p>


<p> Policy/ Influence: Prototypes will test various models of government transparency leading to engagement. Ultimately the tools should lead to widespread adoption of more transparency and engagement programs in cities.</p>





<p>Best Practices and Lessons Learned</p>


<p> Reach: Provide report on best practices and lessons learned.</p>


<p> Engagement: Use developing best practices and continually refine them.</p>


<p> Policy/ Influence: Share best practices with all interested stakeholders through website and CCIP network of local governments, and partnerships with organizations like Department of Neighborhood Empowerment or SCOPE.</p>","Our overarching goal is to use this integrated ideation, prototype and deployment process to significantly change citizen interactions with each other and government in ways that deepen people's connection to and investment in Los Angeles communities.





Over 500 volunteer hours will be dedicated to the NDCH, through participation in the day long event. This project will give those who might not traditionally volunteer an opportunity to use their skills as community organizers, designers, developers, or subject matter experts, to contribute to improving the future of Los Angeles.  By partnering with local community organizations, we also hope to attract populations who are distrustful of Los Angelesâ€™ government, or who have had no previous exposure to the inner workings of local government.  These might include undocumented immigrants, formerly incarcerated people, youth, lowincome people, nonnative English speakers, and minorities.  Engaging these communities in the process of government, providing them with contacts at City Hall, and ensuring that government services are directed toward these groups is vitally important for a city that continues to struggle with enormous racial and economic divides, and in which many residents harbor deep resentment toward local government agencies.





In addition to volunteering, the participants will leave the event with new connections and relationships with other community members, and those connections will be nurtured through the prototyping workshops, where teams that formed during the NDCH will continue to meet, collaborate, and create together. The ideas discussed and prototyped during from the NDCH will be geared toward social connectedness, producing greater involvement in the community by residents.  This, in turn, will lead to community input at City Hall that is more representative than what is typically received, resulting in solutions that respond more directly to community needs.  But we also expect that relationships formed during the process of Civic Lab will be valuable to participants as they seek to establish networks that can later assist in everything from public safety to childcare to finding a job.  By bringing diverse groups of people together, the Civic Lab will create bonds that strengthen neighborhoods and promote the health and wellbeing of its residents.


 


Additionally, the CCIP aims to have a longerterm impact beyond the region, both in California and nationally, by creating a documented set of practices that other regions can use to come together across cities and sectors in an effort to foster more engaged communities.  This will establish Los Angeles as a leader in the space of civic innovation, instilling pride in residents and the local governments that serve them, and encouraging further collaboration between the two.","<p>At the CCIP we believe that increased civic participation results in more resilient communities that provide a better quality of life for residents. As Los Angelenos grow stronger networks within their communities and city, they will be better equipped to respond to disasters, demand responsive governments, and develop leaders for the future. The CCIP aims to make change throughout California, and the Los Angeles region is a significant stakeholder in our progress.</p>





<p>By 2050 the prototypes developed by the community, through this project, and tested in the cities will be replaced, but we can hope that the new connections and relationships, and even the new skills and experience, developed through the National Day of Civic Hacking event and prototyping workshops will last beyond five years and shape the way people interact with one another and government well into the future. </p>"

The project will model a 21st century classroom through transforming a neglected library at Locke High School into an Innovation Space while developing the HackerSpace in a Box â€˜Creativity Generatorâ€™ to foster studentsâ€™ exploration, critical thinking, and collaborative problem solving.</p><p>""What will public education in Los Angeles look like in 2050?â€  If the current system remains as resistant to meaningful reform as it has for the past half century, then 50% of our cityâ€™s ninth graders will fail to graduate with a worthwhile diploma and face a lifetime of limited opportunities. For anybody who cares about the future of the city, the question should be twofold â€œWhat do we want Los Angeles to look like in 2050? How do we need public education to transform to get us there?â€</p><p>Public education must accept that a model developed to meet the needs of a nineteenth century manufacturingbased economy is no longer viable in the 21st century. It must evolve to meet the needs of an economy shifting to creativity and invention in almost every field, from medicine and manufacturing to agriculture and politics. Public education is doing little to prepare students for such an environment.</p><p>The Salamander Project addresses two challenges to such an evolution. Firstly it considers the future of the school library. The school library has declined in importance and its relevance called into question. Many new schools are built without libraries. Many existing libraries are unused anachronisms: forgotten and neglected spaces filled with outdated books. The Salamander Project will redefine the purpose of such â€˜dead spaceâ€™ and adapt it to the evolving needs of schools, students, and teachers. </p><p>Secondly, the project explores how to inject, or seed, creativity in the classroom through the development of â€˜Creativity Generatorsâ€™ such as HackerSpace in a Box. The last few years have seen an explosion in the digital education marketplace. Hundreds of companies are developing innovative new classroom applications of technology. However, the industry is still in its early stages, with little appreciation for the challenges of wide scale adoption. Many teachers, even forward thinking earlyadopters, struggle to understand how such innovations can be realistically incorporated into their schools. The Salamander Project will provide teachers with the opportunity to explore and pilot a new education toolâ€” HackerSpace in a Boxâ€” that inspires creative thinking processes within a collaborative, projectbased learning environment that will model a realistic vision of a 21st century education.</p><p>The project comprises two distinct phases:</p>





<p>PHASE 1


Through a weeklong series of innovation workshops, two groups comprising visionary thoughtleaders in the education and design fields will address two key questions: 1) How to build the ultimate â€œcreativity generatorâ€ and â€˜seedâ€™ creativity within the learning environment; and 2) How to create a physical space that encourages collaboration and creative problem solving.</p>





<p>No Right Brain Left Behind will, along with their partners, Sparkling Science, will further develop an innovative digital learning tool and creativity generator called HackerSpace in a Box. Currently, HackerSpace is comprised of an Arduinobased circuit board called the Makey Makey, electroconductive paint, and copper tape. This open source creativity kit enables students to create customized computer interfaces from elements in their surroundings by connecting electroconductive objects and surfaces to the circuit board. Currently, HackerSpace requires facilitated workshops with teachers and students before it can be implemented in the classroom. In order to increase adoptability, No Right Brain Left Behind will redesign the experience to enable ease of use for teachers as well as students, and start developing a comprehensive curriculum. Meanwhile, a group led by The Third Teacher+, an educational design agency, will consider the conversion of the school library at Green Dotâ€™s Locke High School into an Innovation Space and produce a comprehensive design brief.</p>





<p>PHASE TWO


From June to August, the design brief will be developed into an interior design for the remodeling of the library into an Innovation Space. Concurrently, No Right Brain Left Behind will develop the next generation HackerSpace in a Box and associated curricula and lesson plans. Remodeling will take place in July. Teachers will be trained in the Innovation Space in August. From September to December, Green Dot will pilot the nextgeneration HackerSpace in a Box within the Innovation Space throughout the semester. Education specialists from UCLAâ€™s Graduate School of Education and USCâ€™s Rossier School of Education will observe lessons and provide feedback. </p>","<p>Over the past 12 years, Green Dot has grown from a single 9th grade class of 140 students in Inglewood to serve 10,300 atrisk students in 18 schools across Los Angeles, half of them turnarounds of LAUSDâ€™s lowestperforming schools. 90% of students graduate with 76% going on to attend college. Green Dotâ€™s dramatic expansion has been fueled by a commitment to â€˜doing what it takesâ€™ to break down the barriers that prevent students from thriving. Our first five schools were located throughout Los Angeles, with an emphasis on diverse neighborhoods that were underserved by traditional public schools. In 2012, those schools scored an average 764 on the Academic Performance Index (API), Californiaâ€™s primary measure of accountability; higher than both district and state averages. The schools are among the highest performing â€˜minorityâ€™ schools in California.</p>





<p>In 2008, in collaboration with teachers and the community, Green Dot won control of Alain Leroy Locke High School, one of the lowestachieving schools in the nation. Four years into the transformation, the Locke schools scored over 600 API compared to a pretransformation score of 511. In 2010, Green Dot launched a new strategy to address the chronic attainment levels of incoming 9th graders through the opening of highquality middle schools, two the result of a takeover of Henry Clay Middle School, ranked as the worst middle school in California. Concurrently, LAUSD invited us to take over David Starr Jordan High School, located in the heart of the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts. Early indicators suggest that students at these schools are already experiencing significant gains under the Green Dot model. </p>





<p>Joining Green Dot, No Right Brain Left Behind brings expertise in designcentered problem solving. NRBLB started a movement in 2011 that highlighted the widescale concerns for the countryâ€™s creativity crisis and the desire to find solutions. During a seven day innovation challenge, NRBLB asked the best in the creative industries to develop â€˜creativity generatorsâ€™ to be used in the classroom. Renowned innovators and experts including Sir Ken Robinson, Yves Behar, Daniel Pink, Deepak Chopra, and Scott Belsky joined the cause.  Over 150 worldclass companies such as Frog Design, BBDO, Wolff Olins, and Saatchi&Saatchi developed over 300 concepts. The winning concept received incompany funding to bring their concept to action. </p>





<p>NRBLB has been awarded accolades by Core77Design and The SwedishAmerican Chamber of Commerce; presented at events such as TEDx, Art Directors Club, and LiveWire; and been featured in FastCompany, GOOD Magazine, Core77, BrainPickings, Design Mind, and Art Rebels. To date, NRBLB has built a strong coalition of companies, design schools, education networks, and creative professionals able to develop scalable, lowcost, and adoptable innovation tools that enhance creativity inside and outside of classrooms. </p>





","Green Dot Public Schools and No Right Brain Left Behind will be joined by a variety of design and education partners in the development and implementation of The Salamander Project. The following companies have so far been approached to be involved: The Third Teacher+ studio of Cannon Design, an educational design consultancy within the global architecture firm, Cannon Design; GameDesk, a research and educational game developer; Sparkling Science, a Swedish educational product developer; MinecraftEdu, the educational version of the popular worldbuilding game.


","<p>The Salamander Project will be evaluated by Green Dotâ€™s experienced Knowledge Management Team through a variety of physical documentation alongside quantitative and qualitative data at each phase of development. </p>





<p>Phase 1: Design


Phase 1 will be assessed through the quality of completed documentation. Working groups will develop 1) A working prototype of the nextgeneration HackerSpace in a Box, and 2) A comprehensive design brief for transforming the Locke High School library space into a 21st century innovation hub.</p>





<p>Phase 2: Implementation 


Phase 2 will be assessed through the ability to construct the Innovation Space to specifications, on time, and within budget and the quality and adoptability of the HackerSpace in a Box curricula and lesson plans. We have set a goal of 20 teachers to take part in initial training and 500 students to enroll in the semesterlong project. </p>





<p>Phase 3: Outcomes


Student outcomes will be evaluated through the use of the Torrance Test for Creative Thinking, one of the mostrespected assessments in the field of divergent and critical thinking skills. Students will take the test at the start of the semester to establish benchmarks and at the end to gauge growth. Additionally, Green Dot will gauge teacher engagement and measure participating student progress through analysis of student test scores in California Standards Tests (CSTs) to assess more general academic growth. </p>





<p>Beyond quantitative test score data, qualitative assessments will include teacher and student surveys and indepth interviews. Questions will focus on perceptions of improved engagement with curriculum, creativity, participation, test scores, and understanding of subject matter.</p>  





<p>Phase 4: Documentation


Green Dot and No Right Brain Left Behind, together with our collaborators, will document the process through film and interviews with designers and participants. Progress towards the larger goal of inspiring and motivating broader change at the city level will be evaluated through the number of visitors and observers to the Innovation Space and requests for the development blueprint to create Innovation Spaces at other locations.</p>


","The Salamander Project will excite, inspire and motivate students, parents, and school operators to rethink the future of Los Angeles and its public education system and kickstart a meaningful, bipartisan, reformfocused dialogue.





At the end of the grant period, The Salamander Project will have built a fully functioning Innovation Space at the Locke campus and conducted â€˜creativity generationâ€™ activities with 500 students. Beyond the grant period, No Right Brain Left Behind will continue to work with Green Dot to further develop the HackerSpace in a Box while building an online community with content, lesson plans, and inspiration where teachers using similar devices and DIY learning can upload their findings and classroom experiments. Green Dot will partner with other product developers in the creation and piloting of new digital learning tools, curricula, and lesson plans while providing a demonstration site for others in the education community to glimpse the possibilities of the future of public education in L.A.





Just a month ago, the Los Angeles School Board elections inspired only 6% voter participation across Los Angeles, despite general awareness that our public schools are in crisis. Voter participation in the communities most dramatically impacted by poor political decisionmaking is even lower and illustrates a resignation to the idea that the status quo is unalterable. More than ever, the cityâ€™s communities require inspiration and motivation to believe that something better is possible. Already, Green Dot invests significant resources in educating and training the adult communities in which we work to equip them with the tools necessary to become empowered and authentic agents of change. The Innovation Space will allow parents to access â€˜Creativity Generatorsâ€™ themselves and connect with other communities just as their children connect with students from around the world. The Salamander Project will show parents that a successful, positive, and thriving public education is a very real possibility and in doing so, inspire greater optimism and civic engagement.   





Beyond our own students and their families, the Innovation Space will host visits and demonstrations for other school leaders interested in developing similar spaces of their own. The project will result in an affordable â€˜blueprintâ€™ of how to replicate the Innovation Space at other schools across the city. It is our hope that a network of such Spaces would connect students, teachers, and communities from across Los Angeles and contribute to widescale collaboration and understanding. In providing a working model of a truly 21st century learning environment, we hope to excite, inspire and motivate others to rethink the future of Los Angeles and its public education system and kickstart a meaningful, bipartisan, reformfocused dialogue. 


","<p>Professionals agree on the core skills required to thrive in the emerging fields that will define the 21st century: collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. But the current model of public education was never designed to address the ambiguities and nuances of such skills. Rather, it has relied on the conveying of concrete facts with little room for personalization or individual expression. </p>  





<p>But children are born curious; creativity comes naturally. Unfortunately, for many children, the effect of public schools is quite opposite, described frequently by kids as young as six as â€˜like being in a cageâ€™. Though trial and error are necessary prerequisites for inquiryâ€”scientific and otherwiseâ€”questioning and â€˜permission to failâ€™ are frequently banished from the classroom. Testing with computerized grading canâ€™t distinguish between a probing response and the â€˜rightâ€™ answer. To hear young people tell it, our nationâ€™s public schools are making war on imagination and creativity. </p>





<p>We envision a public education system of 2050 that doesnâ€™t simply pay lip service to collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity as isolated subjects, but embeds them within the core instructional and operational framework of the school. We envision a public education system that from Kindergarten through college, personalizes the learning experience of every child, allowing each to discover and pursue their passion in partnership with likeminded peers. We envision the classroom transformed into a collaborative studio environment that facilitates dialogue between students, teachers, mentors, and advisors from across the world. We envision the teacher as an expert facilitator and curator, selecting and synthesizing an online world of content for their studentsâ€™ consideration and guiding studentsâ€™ critical assessment and understanding. We envision the school as the physical hub of the community, bringing people together and nurturing empowered citizenry even as it operates within a globally connected network of students and teachers.</p>





<p>In 1999, Green Dotâ€™s founders looked at a map of Los Angeles and tried to identify the schools with the basic technology required in the new century: green dots indicated those that were prepared; red dots indicated those that werenâ€™t. The map was overwhelmingly red. Our mission is as simple now as it was over a decade ago: to turn red dots into green dots. The Salamander Project is a natural extension of that mission, seeding a vision of a 21st century education and facilitating its growth throughout the Green Dot network of schools and beyond throughout the district.</p>

3102189,2013189,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/oasisusa.html,Making LA TraffickFree: ending trafficking 1 COMMUNITY at a time, Social Connectedness,"We want to see human trafficking end in Los Angeles and throughout the United States. We believe it is possible to end human trafficking 1 COMMUNITY at a time using a multisectored approach that mobilizes and empowers individuals from within the community to address vulnerabilities for trafficking in their own local area.  Oasis has developed the TraffickFree Community (TFC) model to mobilize and equip citizens to lead local, grassroots action by working with 8 key stakeholders with the collective power to end slavery.  To initiate this kind of change in LA, Oasis would like to start 10 new TFCs by the end of 2013. 





Human Trafficking is a global problem with a local face that will only be effectively addressed as local communities take responsibility for responding to specific issues in their area.  Oasis was founded in the 1980s in London with a vision for community transformation; itâ€™s now grown to 10 countries across the world, each fighting human trafficking by empowering local communities.  In the US, the secret to success is the TFC model of local ownership by citizen leaders who leverage their social capital for cooperative change that benefits the whole community. Oasis provides the necessary training and support to build skills and opportunities that foster mutual trust and constructive social interaction. 





Oasis has identified 8 key community stakeholders that could potentially engage with the life of someone who has been trafficked â€“ schools, local business, consumers, media, faith communities/NGOs, first responders, law enforcement and local legislatures.  When working together, using their collective power for the benefit of the vulnerable and marginalized, these stakeholders strengthen the community to function as a whole â€“ a place where everyone is included, making a contribution and reaching their ultimate potential.  Communities should be healthy, inclusive, integrated, empowering and supportive, where every citizen can experience wholeness and fullness of life.  Trafficking is not able to exist or flourish here. 





The uniqueness of the TFC model is its ability to replicate antitrafficking campaigns and activities in a variety of contexts, regardless of social, racial, ethnic, socioeconomic or other demographic factors.  Each TFC looks different because each community is different.  Therefore, it is essential that local citizen leaders from within the community drive the vision, strategy and activities of a TFC.  TFCs are catalysts that motivate, encourage and lead by example, united by a common ideology that trafficking has no place in our communities â€“ in LA or globally. 





10 new TFCs will be strategically established throughout LA using the following criteria: 


â€¢	proximity to known trafficking routes; 


â€¢	committed and engaged citizen leaders; 


â€¢	existing antitrafficking networks and momentum.  


In addition to receiving training on the global and local dynamics of trafficking, new TFC participants will be trained in research design to discover the vulnerabilities and issues specific to their community.  They will learn how to engage the 8 stakeholders, first focusing on existing networks and those that influence the most significant vulnerabilities in their communities.  Empowered with information and strategies for engaging the resources and networks necessary for bringing about change, Oasis will continue to develop, resource and support these citizen leaders to act  creating stronger more connected communities.  Additionally, these new TFCs will have the opportunity to engage and learn from one another and existing TFCs  sharing best practices, team and community building techniques, advocacy tools, challenges and stories. 





Furthermore, Oasis will equip these civic leaders to be creative catalysts empowered to educate, organize, train and lead others.  In addition to creating 10 new TFCs, Oasis will sponsor and facilitate no less than 10 additional community engagement events.  These events will provide models for awareness and outreach events, while resourcing new TFCs with a solid foundation on which they can build their networks and implement strategies specific to the needs of their communities. Such events could include general human trafficking awareness and education for Angelinos, specialized stakeholder trainings, leadership and community building workshops, and strategic listening groups between stakeholders (e.g. police and youth; police and first responders; teachers, parents and students; businesses and consumers).. 





Effective collaboration and partnership between and amongst TFCs requires efficient and user friendly communication tools and platforms.  Part of this project will invest in communication tools, training curriculum, campaign promotional materials, marketing and/or other resources for training and supporting TFCs as they work to educate, engage and unite their community in the fight against slavery.","After several years of testing and developing the model, there are now 14 TFCs in various stages of development in California, Colorado, Ohio and Florida.  Through training and support provided by Oasis, TFCs:





â€¢	Participated as a leading member of the Raise the Bar! campaign on a multiyear national campaign to petition Hershey to use fair trade chocolate; in late 2012 Hershey announced specific plans to head in that direction;


â€¢	Provide ongoing support and assistance to a young woman trafficked into the USA who then identified herself as a victim to a local LA TFC;


â€¢	Resourced the FBI, local law enforcement and direct service providers with more than 60 freedom bags for trafficking victims rescued in a LA sting operation this year; more than 100 freedom bags have been provided in the last year;


â€¢	Worked with the LA Metro AntiTraffickingTask Force to implement a citywide antitrafficking bus bench campaign in 2012;


â€¢	Provided education and awareness to over 1200 new activists in 201112;


â€¢	Mentor survivors of trafficking in partnership with direct service providers, while also providing ESL, cooking and baking classes;


â€¢	Created an antitrafficking awareness campaign with funding from the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refuge and Resettlement that reached over 8,000 people facetoface with awareness information; we worked with Chinese media outlets to publish ten newspaper articles, televise multiple interviews, produce a public service announcement aired on three different Chinese channels, and carry out a public awareness campaign using the LA metro transport system;


â€¢	Share valuable information and research gathered on trafficking hotspots and vulnerabilities with local officials, most recently a local LA County mayor who was unaware of the issues facing his community;


â€¢	Served as a subgrantee in partnership with the Coalition Against Slavery and Trafficking on a Department of Justice grant; through more than 60 outreach and training events, Oasis provided training to more than 5,000 individuals in the LA area;   


â€¢	Celebrated several years of grass roots community organizing and advocacy in partnership with Fair Trade Town USA in seeing Pasadena declared the second Fair Trade Town in California;  


â€¢	Partnered with Pasadena Unified School District enabling more than 250 high school students to receive antitrafficking awareness and education through its â€˜Summer Skillzâ€™ program; this curriculum, currently being adapted for use by public schools in Florida, can also be adapted for younger students and is available upon request.","While drawing on the knowledge, resources, networks and tools of the Oasis global family and the 14 TFCs already in development around the U.S., this project will primarily capitalize on our local partnerships. The new TFCs will greatly benefit from our networks and resources as a founding member of the L.A. AntiTrafficking Task Force, and our close relationships with two leading LA NGOs  the Coalition Against Slavery and Trafficking and Saving Innocence.  These partners, including local and federal law enforcement, city/county agencies, political officials, NGOs, and direct service providers can contribute their expertise and field experience through training, networking, workshop participation and citywide event promotion. ","Indicators for the success of our project will be: 


â€¢	Individuals are aware of vulnerabilities in their communities and actively engaged in prevention


â€¢	Participation and inclusion from diverse representatives within the community


â€¢	Ownership and leadership of the community process and engagement


â€¢	Stakeholder engagement around antitrafficking strategies and interventions


â€¢	Investment in new and ongoing resources and networks. 





We will quantify these indicators biannually by measuring the following items, using a newly developed opensource database program now available for all Oasis countries:


o	Do the TFCs meet together consistently with representation and participation from diverse populations within the city? 


o	Have the TFCs undertaken the research and discovery process to identify the particular vulnerabilities for trafficking in their community?


o	Based upon the research and discovery process, has the TFC identified one or two key stakeholders with whom to deepen their engagement?


o	How many community stakeholder meetings take place between two or more stakeholders?


o	How many community engagement events (awareness/outreach, workshops, listening groups, campaigns, etc.) have been hosted and facilitated by the TFCs?


o	Do the cityâ€™s residents know where and how to access resources and tools related to trafficking, including the toll free hotline number?


o	Are more citizens of LA able to identify the risks and definition of human trafficking?


o	Are TFCs able to refer and support survivors in restoration and community? 


o	Are stakeholders implementing strategies designed to mitigate the vulnerabilities of trafficking, raise awareness on trafficking issues and promote and make resources available to resources?


o	Are the TFC leaders participating in ongoing leadership development training and activities offered through Oasis?


o	Have police, prosecutors, judges and first responders been trained in fighting/identifying trafficking and its victims? 


o	Have resources been identified that can provide for the physical, psychological, spiritual and social recovery of victims, such as housing and counseling, in a language victims understand?


","LA will benefit from the trust, mutual support and unity established as all of its citizens are invited to participate in the creation of 10 new TFCs.  These TFCs will bring citizens from diverse racial, ethnic, language, socioeconomic and educational groups to learn from one another and then develop and lead coordinated and comprehensive strategies that will strengthen the city. Empowered with the knowledge and skills they receive from Oasis USA and its partners, LAâ€™s citizens will be equipped to leverage their resources and networks to engage key stakeholders to use their collective power to build and shape LA. Moreover, building the capacity of LAâ€™s citizens through participating in TFCs can be further utilized in grass roots efforts focused on other key areas of community development. 





TFCs will host and facilitate numerous trainings, awareness and outreach events, listening groups, workshops, and other community engagement strategies, while also developing and sharing prevention and education campaigns and tools for various sectors of the LA community.  These resources will inform and educate a significant number of LAâ€™s citizens on the dangers of trafficking and enable them to identify the warning signs of trafficking.  For example, as a result of TFC community engagement strategies, local law enforcement officials will better understand and implement the laws and practices regarding how to serve trafficking victims, identify perpetrators, and manage trafficking investigations. These strategies will also ensure victims of trafficking know what resources are available to them and how to access such resources. As trust and cooperation are built between law enforcement and the citizens of LA, there will be a greater flow and exchange of information and transparency between these two groups regarding victim resources, perpetrator profiles, trafficking routes and hotspots.  Greater community awareness, as well as the trust established and mutual support built through shared learning, communication and strengthened relationships will promote safer and healthier choices.  When local individuals are empowered with knowledge and resources, recognizing they are not isolated from their peers and community structures but rather connected to supportive and caring networks, it becomes much more difficult for traffickers to operate there.  Even more, traffickers will recognize that it is simply not profitable for them to do business within LA.





Trust, communication, mutuality and connectedness can be extended to each of the eight stakeholders critical to affecting change for those experiencing isolation and at risk for trafficking within the city of LA.  We envision the citizens of LA developing creative solutions that combat trafficking, reduce the demand for slaves, educate and protect those are at risk, and restore those who have been victimized with the full support and resources of this community.","In 2050, the citizens of LA will enjoy trusting, mutually supportive, constructive and nurturing relationships with those in their families, workplaces, neighborhoods and throughout the city.  These relationships and connections provide emotional support, while also supporting overall health and wellbeing. Research has shown that higher levels of perceived social connectedness are associated with lower blood pressure, better immune responses, and lower levels of stress hormones  all of which contribute to the prevention of chronic disease. 





After working as catalysts for change  raising awareness, mobilizing their social capital, intervening and ensuring restoration  Los Angeles is now a safer, healthier and inclusive society where people are connected, informed and supported.  Most of all, communities are free of trafficking.  Their grassroots action, combined with the collect power of stakeholder action, has ensured LA enjoys:


â€¢	the most informed, educated and resourced residents on trafficking issues;


â€¢	the most coordinated and cohesive intervention and restoration services;


â€¢	comprehensive laws and ordinances enforced throughout the city;


â€¢	being the first major US city to end human trafficking. 





A few examples of change brought about by the coordinated and cohesive interventions of the stakeholders would include:


o	Comprehensive antitrafficking campaigns and programming within LA schools that empower parents, teachers, administratora, and students to define human trafficking and its risks, confidently identify and work with the relevant authorities in situations where trafficking is happening, or may be occurring, and know where and how to access resources;


o	Law enforcement and first responders are trusted resources able to identify and respond to trafficking appropriately, compassionately and with the full support of the justice system;


o	Local legislatures have examined their laws relating to trafficking, closed the loopholes that once allow trafficking to persist, and demonstrate their commitment to justice through the allocation of resources and services to victims and tough criminal and financial penalties for perpetrators;


o	Local businesses are trained on trafficking and employment regulations, able to map their supply chains, stock a full range of fair trade, slave free products; 


o	Consumers have wide access to and take advantage of fair trade, slave free products in all parts of the city; 


o	The media uses its voice to promote justice, ensuring a platform for the positive, civic engagement of LA citizens around issues of trafficking, while also committing to ending their  participation in the solicitation of human beings;


o	Faith communities are a place of inclusion and reintegration where faith is demonstrated while caring, nurturing and supporting those who were marginalized and excluded â€“ they serve as linkages to information and resources for housing, employment, social support, and spiritual well being."
3102190,2013190,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/onedayinlosangeles.html,One Day in Los Angeles, Social Connectedness,"<p>One Day in Los Angeles is a communitybased, oneday filmmaking event in which participants across L.A. will document the challenges and hopes of our local communities. Participants will film during a 24hour period with the goal of raising the level of community engagement in L.A., and inspiring action towards a better city by 2050. The resulting media will be made available to the public through a geotagged archive and video map of Los Angeles.</p>


<p>In a region divided by mountains, freeways, economic barriers, and municipal boundaries, many of us identify more strongly with our own neighborhoods than with sprawling and fragmented L.A. County. This relationship can manifest as a deep sense of neighborhood pride, but can also take the form of ostracism along poverty lines and language barriers. One Day in Los Angeles will tell stories of the neighborhoods that make up our region, and in doing so expose the challenges and human potential of a large and diverse community.</p>


<p>The 24hour mediacreation event will take place across Los Angeles County, and will feature filmmakers, local charities, city policymakers, community organizations, and student groups filming stories emblematic of the particular struggles and hopes of their communities. In the process, we will create a video dialogue crossing the cultural and economic barriers that inhibit social connectedness, and inspire volunteerism towards enhancing human development in Los Angeles by the year 2050.</p>


<p>The event will be organized by One Day on Earth, an L.A.based nonprofit organization with experience coordinating causebased media creation events on a global scale. The project will culminate with the release of a geotagged video archive featuring all media captured during the event. The technology platform will be based on software developed by One Day on Earth for our annual global collaboration: https://vimeo.com/18910284</p>


<p>One Day in Los Angeles participants are welcome to film any subject matter. The only parameters are, a) all filming takes place within Los Angeles County, b) all filming takes place during the oneday event, and c) the motivation behind filming is for L.A. to become an even better place to live by the year 2050. </p>


<p>To ensure diverse participation, the One Day in Los Angeles staff will reach out to local schools, charities, policymakers, and inspired citizens to join the projectâ€™s social networking platform, www.onedayonearth.org. Onedayonearth.org currently hosts a community of over 35,000 participants representing every country in the world, with over 1200 in L.A. County alone. All prospective participants will be given access to the educational toolkit which was developed to train students of all ages in the use of digital filmmaking technologies </p>(http://www.onedayonearth.org/page/education1.) The toolkit is currently in use in over 70 countries around the world, and has been invaluable to empowering highlevel participation from individuals with access only to camera phones or consumergrade video cameras.


<p>Beyond educational support, project producers will reach out to prominent issuebased filmmakers within the region to serve as localized producers, ensuring that there is comprehensive coverage across all regions of the city, and across all key indicators set forth by the LA 2050 initiative.</p>


<p>One Day in Los Angeles will impact the Social Connectedness indicator by providing an opportunity for regionwide social engagement; generating media that will inspire volunteerism; creating accessible media through the interactive online video archive; and forming a framework for local filmmakers to collectively produce an inclusive view of the current state of human development in Los Angeles.  </p>


<p>While One Day in Los Angeles primarily affects the Social Connectedness indicator, we believe that this is not an insular category. By creating a dialogue between Angelinos communities, the projectâ€™s residual effects could potentially cover all indicators listed by this initiative. A socially connected L.A. will allow citizens to collaborate on shaping their own future and engaging in activities that will most impact the regionâ€™s improvement. </p>


<p>To inspire specifically directed participation we will put forth the following call to action: </p>


<p>If you had one day to document what Los Angeles needs to change by 2050, what would you show us? Tell the story. Take action. Be heard. </p>","<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONE DAY ON EARTH SOCIAL NETWORK:


In early 2010, One Day on Earth launched an online socialnetworking platform to organize an international community of filmmakers. The site (www.onedayonearth.org) currently hosts over 35,000 members representing every country of the world, and over 1,200 in Los Angeles County alone. Through the One Day on Earth platform participants collaborate on an annual film, as described below.</p>





<p>GLOBAL FILMING EVENTS:

","If awarded the LA 2050 Challenge Grant, One Day in Los Angeles will meet the following core criteria of a successful project:





â€“ All areas of Los Angeles are documented by participating filmmakers.





â€“ Over 300 participants take part in the One Day in Los Angeles filming event.





â€“ One Day in Los Angeles engages partnerships with no less than 5 local charities to participate in the filming event and works with those organizations to create media around the key hindrances to human development as put forth by LA 2050.





 No less than 10 educational institutions participate in the filming event. 





â€“ One Day in Los Angeles releases a geotagged video archive of all content produced by the filmmaking community.








Beyond these benchmarks of a successful project, One Day in Los Angeles will seek additional partnerships in funding and working towards the following goals:





 A public screening in Los Angeles that showcases the films produced during the oneday filming event.





â€“ Corporate sponsorship for the One Day in Los Angeles event to provide additional resources to participants, expand the scope of the project, and work towards a fully edited One Day in Los Angeles film.





 Broadcast opportunities for a One Day in Los Angeles film or series through traditional channels, including distribution opportunities through the educational market.


","One Day in Los Angeles will benefit L.A. by providing a participatory, causebased media creation event related to civic and social engagement. The event will produce residual benefits across many fields, as local filmmakers will be asked to document hindrances to human development across greater Los Angeles. The archive will provide access to firsthand experiences, giving a firsthand view of the issues that face Los Angeles and, ultimately, an opportunity to create more informed solutions. 





The undeniable power of seeing the diversity of the Los Angeles experience through a single day enriches the perspective of who we are, interconnecting both our joys and struggles.  





One Day on Earth has over 100 nonprofit partners. Our staff will engage partner organizations as well as build new relationships with local nonprofits specifically for this initiative. By working with local community organizers our producers will draw attention to real frontline issues. One Day in Los Angeles will present an opportunity for local nonprofits to generate media to communicate their mission and to rally support for their cause.





In addition to nonprofit outreach, our staff will focus efforts on inspiring students and educators to participate. Preparing young people to effectively communicate through digital media is a critical tool in expanding civic and social engagement. As with previous One Day on Earth initiatives, One Day in Los Angeles will inspire volunteerism around the issues that matter most to Los Angeles.





With the filming event yielding hundreds of hours of media, the geotagged archive will be searchable by location, keyword, and subject matter. This robust video resource will be a useful tool for local policymakers, community organizers, and educators to reference and support greater insight into both highpriority local issues and cultural diversity. 


","<p>One Day in Los Angeles looks forward to a city in 2050 that has overcome civic apathy and social division by engaging the skills of the worldâ€™s most talented digital media community. Los Angeles trails the national average in volunteerism, voting rates, newspaper readership, and civic engagement. We are a city that remains deeply divided along racial and economic lines. </p>





<p>Our vision of L.A. in 2050 is a city that expands its amazing ability to captivate and move audiences through media, and focuses that ability to educate and expose topics that are critical to the sustainability of our city, and beyond. The vision is of a city where the mediamakers have inspired widespread volunteerism, advocacy, and interconnectedness.</p>





<p>We are looking forward to deploying the One Day on Earth platform as part of our shared vision. Our filming event and resulting archive will seed a dialogue to help develop a clear path towards a more united L.A. in 2050. By using the great strength of our mediamaking community, we can help turn the corner on our long struggle with disconnectedness. Los Angeles can bring down the barriers of economic disparity and cultural exclusion. By 2050 we can see a Los Angeles with a united identity â€“ a connected city. </p>"
3102191,2013191,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/smallbizmicroloans.html,Building Strong Small Businesses through Microlending, Income & Employment,"<p>Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future.  Nearly half of LAâ€™s households do not earn enough to meet basic expenses.  The region lacks adequate wellpaying jobs in growth sectors; this lack of opportunity is compounded for lowincome and minority households by the poor education system.  For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability.  Small business ownership creates opportunities for families living in poverty to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities.  Research has shown that if one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy.  Yet only 50% of small businesses survive, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and poor/insufficient credit.</p>





<p>Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs.  As Californiaâ€™s largest nonprofit microlender, Opportunity Fund provides loans of $2,500 to $100,000 at affordable, fixed interest rates to small business owners with small capital needs and imperfect credit.  We offer a fast, streamlined application process; flexible underwriting criteria and collateral requirements; and clientdriven business advising designed to meet the needs of lowincome entrepreneurs. Our relationshipbased lending model removes barriers to credit that many of our borrowers face when declined by banks, including limited credit history, low net worth, inadequate time in business, lack of collateral, and small financing needs. </p>





<p>As part of our commitment to serving the unique needs of lowincome entrepreneurs, Opportunity Fund offers EasyPayâ€”an innovative automated loan repayment system that allows borrowers to repay loans through a small, fixed percentage of daily credit/debit card sales.  Instead of making monthly payments by check, EasyPay borrowers can base their loan repayment on their actual credit/debit card revenue by â€œsplittingâ€ a fixed percentage of each card transaction toward loan payments.  Opportunity Fund reports these repayments to the credit bureaus, so that borrowers are able to build credit over time.  In practice, the automatic split means that during busy days (i.e. weekends for a restaurant), the business repays more, whereas during slow days (i.e. weekday for a clothing retailer), the business repays less.  It also means that businesses with seasonal sales cycles have a repayment schedule that effectively matches their revenue cycles.  EasyPay provides a convenient way to meet the capital needs of small businesses and help borrowers build credit.  </p>





<p>Opportunity Fundâ€™s microlending program serves entrepreneurs like David, who recently sent his fourth son to college with help from Opportunity Fund (and our EasyPay loan).  David is proprietor of Mirnaâ€™s Market, a swap meet stall in South Los Angeles that features religious and party supplies targeting the cityâ€™s immigrant community.  As a small business owner, David was able to keep his sons close by as they grew upâ€”helping them do their homework in the store or teaching them to work the cash register.  By providing access to affordable and convenient capital to purchase inventory and stock his shelves through EasyPay, Opportunity Fund has helped David keep his business strong and set aside savings to pay for his sonsâ€™ education.</p>","Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in California can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs.  Since 1995, we have originated over 3,200 loans, totaling $35 million, to disadvantaged microentrepreneurs in Californiaâ€™s largest urban centers.  As noted above, our borrowers have an 85% business survival rate, and each Opportunity Fund loan creates or maintains an average of 2.5 jobs.  Additionally, Opportunity Fundâ€™s loans result in a â€œripple effectâ€ of new revenues, wages, and taxesâ€”every $1 we lend generates nearly $2 in new annual economic activity.  





In 2011, Opportunity Fund successfully launched the pilot of our EasyPay loan product.  EasyPay builds on our successful microlending results, taking this proven strategy one step further by leveraging technology to expand the pool of potential microloan borrowers, simplify the repayment process, and help entrepreneurs improve business performance.  





Since its inception, Opportunity Fund has grown from a local, multibank consortium serving Silicon Valley to a nationallyrecognized microfinance institution.  In the process, the organizationâ€™s leadership has seized on opportunities to introduce innovative strategies to expand our impact on underbanked communities in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles.  Opportunity Fund has successfully adapted to the shifting economic landscape by developing new products, implementing new outreach initiatives, and nurturing new partnerships that enable clients to build assets despite changing market conditions.  At the same time, Opportunity Fund has followed a smooth growth curve from a staff of five people to more than 50 in four locations.  





Opportunity Fund is seen as a thought leader in microfinance, with a track record of community impact and a reputation for innovation in developing new microfinance strategies that promote economic opportunity and meet clientsâ€™ needs.  As Californiaâ€™s largest nonprofit microlender, Opportunity Fund is the only organization providing affordable, appropriate credit to LAâ€™s lowincome small businesses at any scaleâ€”we originated more than 300 microloans in the County in 2012 (and 1,002 microloans statewide).  





Opportunity Fund has always been distinguished among economic development organizations for our commitment to reaching the hardesttoreach clients and achieving deep impact.  Our inventive approach to community development has garnered a variety of awards, including selection twice for the prestigious Skoll Foundation Award for Innovation, Bank of Americaâ€™s Neighborhood Excellence Award, and the Small Business Administrationâ€™s Financial Services Advocate of the Year award for our microenterprise work.  


","â€¢ Industry outreach:  We target industries with high numbers of disadvantaged small business owners who lack access to financing and support, such as trucking, landscaping, and mobile food.  


â€¢ Banks:  We have built a network of bank representatives to facilitate referrals of clients who have been declined for a loan.  


â€¢ Businesses:  We also leverage relationships with business services providers to raise awareness and generate referrals, including tax advisors, CPAs, and equipment vendors (manufacturers of food trucks, dry cleaning equipment, etc.).  


â€¢Community partners:  We have referral relationships with organizations that serve local lowincome and disadvantaged communities, such as Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation","Opportunity Fund uses a variety of performance indicators to measure the success of our microloans and our small business clients. In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, as well as client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales, and number of employees.  





Over time, we measure the impact of our loans by tracking changes in borrower household income; growth of business sales and income; job creation; and business survival rates.  We also gather data related to client satisfaction and confidence in running their business as a result of Opportunity Fundâ€™s microlending and advising services.  This data is collected using MicroTest, a performance evaluation tool developed by the Aspen Institute and used by the nationâ€™s leading microenterprise organizations.  Data on these outcomes is measured starting two years after the loan is made, and is collected through phone surveys and tax returns.  





As noted above, Opportunity Fund seeks to invest $2.3 million in 350 small businesses in LAâ€™s underserved urban communities in the coming year.  Based on previous results (as measured through MicroTest surveys), we project that these investments will generate positive outcomes for our borrowers, including the creation/retention of 2.5 jobs per loan on average, a 20+% increase in business revenue, and an 85%+ business survival rate.  





In addition to outcome and impact evaluation, Opportunity Fund uses internal measures to gauge our program effectiveness. We track staff time, marketing expenses, operating costs, loan capital, fundraising capacity, and donated services required to operate the program.  We measure all phases of the loan pipelineâ€”from inquiry through application to loan approval, decline, or withdrawalâ€”and track the number of inquiries by source, conversion rate, and outcome to determine which sales channels are most effective. As a lender, Opportunity Fund closely monitors our outstanding loan portfolio as an indicator of program performance, and periodically reviews our underwriting guidelines if necessary. This data enables continuous improvement to the programâ€™s efficiency and impact, and ultimately enables Opportunity Fund to serve more clientsâ€”and with greater impactâ€”in the future.


","<p>Opportunity Fund is pioneering a new approach to small business support that combines a missiondriven strategy and commitment to impact measurement with the market knowledge, efficiency, and reach needed to make a sustained difference in the lives and livelihoods of Los Angelesâ€™ small business owners.  By deploying capital to lowincome, underserved small business owners, our microlending program helps drive small business growth and job creation in the communities that need it most.</p>





<p>Opportunity Fundâ€™s borrowers have an 85% business survival rate; each loan we originate creates or sustains 2.5 jobs on average.  The financing and support we provide our small businesses helps them increase business revenues by an average of 20%.</p>





<p>The mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown.  As a nonprofit, mission driven, financial institution, Opportunity Fund targets entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream.  In LA, our borrowers are 98% minority, with an average median household income of less than $24,000.</p>





<p>Opportunity Fund made our first microloan in LA in 2010.  Through LA2050, we seek to scale our microlending program in the regionâ€™s underserved communities to support more than 350 small business owners each year in LA County (and 650 in the Greater Los Angeles region).  This loan volume represents a big step toward our vision of a truly inclusive financial system in which every small business owner has access to affordable capital to build a vibrant enterprise, increase household income, create jobs, and support a family and a future.  It means that in the coming year, Opportunity Fund will:</p>


 Invest $2.3 million in small businesses in undercapitalized neighborhoods in LA


 Create or retain more than 850 jobs, primarily in minorityowned and womenowned businesses


 Generate $4 million in new annual economic activity in LA through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.</p>





<p>Natasha is the Cofounder and CEO of CoolHaus ice cream, a gourmet ice cream business that started out as one food truck in Los Angeles and now features 10 trucks and 55 employees in 4 cities, as well as a storefront in Culver City and distribution through Whole Foods Markets.  When Natasha wanted to purchase a second truck and start expanding her business, she could not qualify for conventional financing.  CoolHaus was less than two years old, and was not yet profitable.  In addition, Natasha was still paying off student loans, and her credit score reflected this debt.  Instead, Natasha came to OF for a $25,000 loan to help the business expand. As Natasha describes, â€œThe loan from Opportunity Fund was the catalyst at a key moment in our growth!â€  CoolHaus has since received two more OF loans to support national expansion.</p>","Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs.  While we have no illusions that our microloans can eradicate income inequality, we believe that strong investment in the regionâ€™s small business community can drive economic growth and create jobs that offer a living wage.  Many of LAâ€™s most economically distressed neighborhoods are also hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity.  By providing access to capital and support for these small businesses, Opportunity Fund can help them grow and thriveâ€”offering a path to financial stability and economic mobility.  





We know that every loan we make creates and sustains more than two jobs, and that every $1 we invest results in a multiplier effect that generates almost $2 in new economic activity.  By seeking to scale microlending in Los Angeles, Opportunity Fund is positioned to help thousands and thousands of small business owners access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050â€”supporting job creation at significant scale while spurring economic growth in communities that need it most.

3102192,2013192,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/neighbor.html,Neighbor to Neighbor: Connecting Los Angeles Through Storytelling, Social Connectedness,"One of the best ways to connect people is through storytelling. In September of 2013, we will launch a 24hour collaborative filmmaking project that connects diverse populations and neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The theme of the project is â€œlocal heroesâ€ and each team will discover, document, and share inspiring stories of the community. 15 filmmaking teams will be assembled that consist of three novice filmmakers from underserved communities, three professional filmmakers (mentors), and six to ten volunteers. Each team will be diverse in age, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Moreover, each project will take place in a different neighborhood, with the goal of occupying as many unique areas of Los Angeles as possible. Prior to shooting the film, the team will work with communitybased organizations to discover stories of local heroes and to build support for the project. The teams will have a month to develop relationships, but only one day to actually shoot and edit the film. At the end of the 24hour period, the films will be screened first to the community, then as a complete program at a special event, and finally theyâ€™ll live online and will be pushed out via a social networking campaign. Prizes will be given to the most impactful film, greatest number of volunteers engaged, and best team cooperation. ","Founded by UCLA students in 1982, Outfest is the leading organization that promotes equality by creating, sharing, and protecting LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) stories on the screen. Outfest builds community by connecting diverse populations to discover, discuss, and celebrate stories of LGBT lives. Over the past three decades, Outfest has showcased thousands of films from around the world to audiences of nearly a million, educated and mentored hundreds of emerging filmmakers, and protected more than 20,000 LGBT films and videos. In addition, Outfest produces one of the largest film festivals in Southern California, the only LGBT people of color film festival, three filmmaking programs using mentors, and we have over 400 volunteers who participate in our programs. ","Outfest has over 80 community partners that we work with through our film festivals that include The Wall La Memorias Project, Jovenes Inc., Satrang, AIDS Project Los Angeles, Childrenâ€™s Hospital Los Angeles, GayStraight Alliance Network (GSA Network), Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, The Trevor Project, The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, and The Community Rights Campaign. We will work with many of these organizations, specifically those who are neighborhood and/or community specific. In addition, we will engage neighborhood councils, such as the Historic Highland Park Neighborhood Council, who has been a key collaborator in a recent neighborhood based Outfest program. ","In the short term, we will measure success by the number of volunteers who participate, the number of films that are completed, how well the teams work together, and how many community members were engaged to complete the projects. In the long term, weâ€™ll look at how many of the participants in the project continued in volunteer service at Outfest or another nonprofit organization, how many people got more engaged in their neighborhood or community, how many underserved people became engaged in filmmaking or storytelling as a result of this project, and how many people used the skills they learned in the project to get work. Ideally, this project will continue annually and will build stronger and deeper relationships within neighborhoods every year. ","By organizing diverse teams to tell a story about a local hero in 15 different neighborhoods across Los Angeles. This project will: 


1. Engage at least 300 volunteers. 


2. Build community among people of diverse backgrounds. 


3. Deepen connection to neighborhoods by highlighting local heroes. 


4. Provide basic training to at least 45 novice filmmakers who can transport their skills into the job force. ","In 2050, Los Angeles neighborhoods will have actively engaged residents, who not only know their neighbors, but they know their neighborâ€™s histories and stories, as well as their local heroes. Community members will understand the issues that affect their neighborhoods, collaborate in uplifting the Los Angeles region, and participate in local government. The result of this connection and involvement is that all neighborhoods will have affordable housing, jobs within a 30minute commute, and access to parks, arts, and culture. 





Our project, Neighbor to Neighbor: Connecting Los Angeles Through Storytelling, contributes to this picture of success by connecting people to each other through communitybased collaborative storytelling and volunteerism. By working on a project together people will get to know each other, develop common bonds, become involved in their community and invested in making Los Angeles a better place to live for everyone.

3102193,2013193,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Passion.html,A Passion at Risk, Education,"``A Passion at Risk,'' will be a 40minute short film about teachers from throughout Los Angeles County and their opinions about the future of education reform. Since ``A Nation at Risk,'' was released 30 years, schoolteachers in Los Angeles have been working in a constant state of reform. Some who started out in their early 20s and are now approaching retirement have spent their whole careers in a sector in a constant cycle of reinvention. In this film, teachers will tell their stories about which reforms have worked and which reforms have fallen short and why. Los Angeles still has a persistent achievement gap, many failing schools and a dropout crisis. Most reforms that have not succeeded through the years have failed due to ineffective implementation. In looking back, we will find great ideas that worked and not so great ideas that led to ridiculous situations. Teachers consistently say they are left out of the conversations about reform and are just given marching orders from administrators who may be unaware of the challenges they face in their classrooms. ``A Passion at Risk,'' will give Los Angeles teachers a voice and give them the opportunity to share their visions for a more collaborative future. There will be one teacher for each grade from K12 and they will be chosen from traditional public schools, charter schools, private and parochial schools. We will not find out until the end what ``type'' of school it is where they are teaching. They will range in age from new teachers to teachers will vast experience. There will be teachers who are union activists and others who do not belong to a union at all. The film is titled, ``A Passion at Risk,'' because so many teachers are leaving the profession despite their passion for teaching. 


Los Angeles is already seeing teachers come together to talk about how they can have a stronger voice in policies that impact their classroom. This film is meant to serve as an inspiration to that movement and to emphasize the importance of involving teachers in the discussion about how to dramatically improve our schools in the next 37 years. ","Pacesetter Productions is a new name for a consulting business Lee Condon has run from 2005 to the present. During that time, our project teams have produced more than 30 videos honoring teachers, principals and schools that have won awards from the California Charter Schools Association. Please see examples here: 


http://www.leecondon.com/videoproduction.html


In addition, Lee Condon served as the producer of the California Charter Schools Conference from 2007 to 2012, creating extensive programming for teachers, including a Teacher Expo. The event grew from 1,600 to 3,300 attendees in this time period. Our teams have also produced promotions and videos to support the growth of the charter school movement. Please see details here. 


http://www.leecondon.com/portfolio.html


Lee Condon, the director and producer of the film, was a founding staff member at the California Charter Schools Association and served as chief of staff to LAUSD School Board President Caprice Young. 


Before becoming involved in education reform, Lee Condon worked as a journalist for 11 years. Selected writing is linked below: 


http://www.leecondon.com/writing.html","Brian Appel, Bad Appel Production. Brian Appel and I have worked on several film projects together. Brian will serve as the editor for the project. ","The project is meant to inspire school districts to more fully involve teachers in their efforts to improve our schools. In addition, the film will inspire teachers to demand a more active role in how reform will be implemented in their classrooms. The project will be successful if education reform organizations embrace its message and host screenings that will start conversations among local teachers. In addition, we will use the website to promote and distribute the film online. ","The education community in Los Angeles is outrageously fractured. Despite many attempts to improve education in Los Angeles, we still have persistently failing schools throughout the county. Many times we look for a one size fits all solution and instead of empowering teachers, we are imposing strict rules and regulations that may or may not benefit their work with their students. Currently in LAUSD, we are about to implement a new teacher evaluation system that will likely fail to because of opposition from teachers and a lack of a clear plan from administrators. This film will highlight the need for teachers to have a voice in the changes they will be asked to implement in their classrooms. ","In 2050, education in Los Angeles would be built to serve the needs of its students. Instead of sticking with systems just because that is always the way things have been done, our communities will have freedom and flexibility to create education programs that inspire our students to excellence. We will come up with funding structures that are consistent so that our schools are not left in a constant cycle of crisis. We will provide teachers with higher salaries and provide incentives to keep our best teachers in the classroom. "
3102194,2013194,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/pacoimabeautiful.html,Van Nuys Blvd. Green Project, Environmental Quality,"Van Nuys Boulevard is often referred to as the central artery of Pacoima. For the LA 2050 Challenge, Pacoima Beautiful would like to reinvigorate the 1.6 mile stretch of Van Nuys Blvd. between Laurel Canyon Blvd. and Glenoaks Blvd. There are over 60 small businesses on that portion of Van Nuys Blvd. These businesses range from independently owned and operated grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, cell phone stores, flower shops, and many others. Many of these businesses are surviving on a monthtomonth basis. They cover their payroll, and operating costs (rent, and utilities) without being able to invest in business improvements, much less streetscape improvements. 





If granted $100,000 Pacoima Beautiful would like to reward business owners in a manner that promotes environmental stewardship and saves them money. The funds from the LA 2050 Challenge would allow us to award 40 businesses, each with $1,000 in goods and services paid by Pacoima Beautiful to make environmentally friendly improvements to their business. The remaining funds would be used to make streetscape improvements to the 1.6 mile stretch of Van Nuys Blvd. and cover program costs. Making these green improvements will begin a shift in the way our business community thinks about environmental responsibility.





Examples of eligible improvements are (but not limited to): Implementing the use of recycling bins, zero to low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paint, energy efficient lighting, energy efficient windows, drought tolerant/native landscaping, green roofs, air conditioning system improvements, etc. 





Eligibility for the $1,000 (in goods and services) would be determined through an application process. Working in conjunction with groups such as the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce and the Valley Economic Development Center we would look into 1) Which environmental impact would the applicants improvement minimize? 2) How long has the business been in operation? 3) How will the business owner(s) maintain/sustain the improvement? We will also evaluate our award recipientâ€™s awareness of environmental hazards and green business practices starting at the application process. This initial evaluation will be used as a baseline to gauge need for improvements and knowledge of environmentally safe practices.





Awards would be given out from September 2013 through October 2013. Streetscape improvements would be completed no later than the end of April of 2014. 





In regards to the Environmental Quality indicator, our efforts would result in improved environmental quality due to creating a business culture that is less harmful to the environment, and more welcoming due to improved streetscapes. We also look forward to providing an increased sense of support for our business community and increased civic pride. In our community our people are our strength. Within our business community, business owners are very dedicated to creating jobs, and serving the needs of their customers. At Pacoima Beautiful we would like to include businesses into our culture of environmental justice and provide them with education and support to pass on to their employees and customers. 





At Pacoima Beautiful we create awareness in our community through engagement in our various free programs. To sustain the enthusiasm for maintaining improved streetscapes and business practices we welcome all members of the business community to learn how city planning and civic engagement can benefit them through our 12week Peopleâ€™s Planning School. The curriculum focuses on city planning, public participation, environmental stewardship, advocacy, and leadership development which will help us achieve our vision of a better L.A. in 2050.


","From 1997 to 2005, between 20 and 30 residents a year participated in six month trainings to learn how to inspect their neighborhoods, document environmental health hazards and how to support their neighbors in reducing and preventing those hazards. Residents learned to identify environmental hazards and access resources to address those hazards, how to increase awareness of environmental health issues and become advocates for change. From 2006 through the present, our Community and Environmental Planning work has focused on community wide environmental issues and to date program staff has engaged hundreds of residents in workshops and presentations in order to identify and prioritize environmental concerns.  Most recently this has included advocacy to reduce the impacts of diesel pollution and to promote policies to transform Environmental Justice communities, such as our landmark Clean Up, Green Up campaign working with organizations throughout the city to reduce, mitigate, and revitalize communities like Pacoima.  


Weâ€™re proud members of the Donâ€™t Waste LA Coalition to create a more efficient waste and recycling industry in Los Angeles and ensure Clean Air, Good Jobs, and Recycling for All, and the RePower LA Coalition to lead LA into an energy efficient future with a plan to save money on energy bills, reduce dependency on dirty coal, and create local, careerpath jobs.  Through these coalition efforts, we are working to improve the quality of our local jobs and environment, while limiting the concentration of environmental harms and increasing the availability of environmental benefits.  We also partner with UCLA Community Research In Cancer (CORICA)  the aim of the CORICA Network is to build communityuniversity partnerships to conduct cancer prevention and control research in underserved communities in Los Angeles and surrounding areas. It aims to conduct research that will help eliminate socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in cancer.  We also have a long history of partnership with the US Environmental Protection Agency. 


Our adult membership meet every month (on the fourth Thursday,68pm) to participate in advocacy, hone their public speaking skills, engage in environmental education, spread the word to their neighbors, and plan projects.


Since 2002, our Safer Homes for a Healthy Community program has provide Pacoima families with information and support to reduce lead, asthma triggers, and home health hazards, including through Integrated Pest Management trainings.  Since 2004 the Promotoras (community health workers) have reached hundreds of residents per year through presentations at schools, churches, fairs and other venues.  The Safer Homes Program has been recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a model program to prevent the impact of toxins.


Revitalization  Increasing Environmental Benefits and Promoting Alternatives


In 2008, Pacoima Beautiful was awarded a PLACE grant (Policies for Livable, Active Communities and Environments) from the LA County Department of Public Health, the only organization with an LA citybased project to receive such a grant.  Through this grant, we worked with youth, community residents and experts to create a Vision Plan to revitalize the Pacoima Wash,a tributary of the LA River.  The Wash holds amazing potential as an open space amenity for our community and we are continuing to work to realize our Vision with funds from Urban Greening and other sources.


Pacoima Beautiful held over 20 community meetings to get input on the project with different community organizations including: parent centers, neighborhood councils, homeowner associations, and youth groups.


â€¢	Held 2 large community events including a Pacoima Wash Mobile Charette where the community walked along the Pacoima Wash and gave input which over 100 people attended.


â€¢	Successfully included our vision plan for revitalizing the Sylmar portion of the Pacoima Wash into the Pacoima Community Plan.


â€¢	Received Urban Greening Grant to create a plan for implementing vegetated bioswales along streets in Pacoima which will capture and treat storm water runoff before it enters the wash.


â€¢	Cosmetic improvements to a pedestrian bridge over the Pacoima Wash used by over 200 students.


â€¢	Plan to develop a 2 acre vacant lot adjacent to the wash which is currently blight into a new pocket park.





 As part of this work, we also serve on the Disadvantaged Community (DAC) committee of the Greater Los Angeles County Integrated Regional Water Management group (GLACIRWM).  Integrated Regional Water Management is a statewide effort to promote more efficient water resource management and planning by encouraging regionâ€wide collaboration.


In spring of 2010, we were awarded a RENEW grant (Renew Environments for Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness), also from the LA County Department of Public Health.  This grant is part of the Center for Disease Controlâ€™s Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative.  Through this grant, we worked to create a vision for Complete Streets based on community and expert input, and worked with our public partner, CRA/LA, to incorporate community priorities for more pedestrian/cyclist friendly streets into their proposed Streetscape Improvement Project for the Pacoima Town Center.  Due to state budget cuts, CRA/LAâ€™s funding has been closed, so we will continue to pursue other avenues to promote Complete Streets infrastructure, walking and biking.  As part of this campaign, we also hosted a 12 session workshop series, Peopleâ€™s Planning School.  Some accomplishments of the Caminos del Pueblo/Complete Streets Campaign include:


â€¢	Gathered input from over 300 residents to identify priorities for streetscape improvements needed to improve Van Nuys Blvd. and promote walking, biking, and public transit use.


â€¢	Presented the project goals to dozens of community organizations including: parent centers, neighborhood councils, homeowner associations, and youth groups.


â€¢	Held 12 Peopleâ€™s Planning School workshops.


â€¢	Participated in the Mayoral ThinkBike Summit with LADOT,LACBC, and others to create a vision for a more bikeable Van Nuys Blvd.


â€¢	Received Itâ€™s Up to All of Us pedestrian safety advocacy grant.


â€¢	Collaborated with LADOT to inform a Safe Routes To Schools grant application to improve Pierce and Herrick.


â€¢	Grassrootsled improvement projects and events such as tree plantings, tile murals, public art, PARKing Day, and joint probike and prowalk events with Youth.


â€¢	Joined the burgeoning equitable transit and transitoriented development coalition, Alliance for a Community Transit, LA (ACTLA).





Youth Environmentalists â€“Building the Future Generation


Our Pacoima Beautiful Youth Environmentalists program (PBYES) trains the next generation of community leaders, giving local teenagers opportunities for meaningful community involvement and promoting leadership development, civic learning and environmental awareness.


Students get involved through yearround afterschool groups, Youth United Towards Environmental Protection (YUTEP),and intensive summer servicelearning Institutes on topics such as â€œHealthy Eating, Active Livingâ€.


YUTEP members have helped conduct surveys on key community issues and outreach to residents.  Recent Institutes have drafted policy briefs, uncovered toxic contamination in a trailer park, and created open space proposals.


Most recently, YUTEP has expanded its efforts by forming high school chapters in Arleta High School, San Fernando High School, Discovery Charter, and Vaughn International Studies Academy.


",Possible partners are the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce and the Valley Economic Development Center,"As an added component to this program, we would like to engage members of our youth program (Youth United Towards Environmental Protection) to assist us with the implementation and evaluation process. Our program success will be measured by the maintenance and additional understanding/investment of environmentally safe improvements at the 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month following the implementation of their business improvement. During the 12th month assessment, award recipients will be asked to answer a survey regarding the business and streetscape improvements, how they impacted their business, and if they will continue to look for greener ways of operating their business. Continuous followup will also create improved communication with our business community.","The project will benefit Los Angeles in several forms, both direct and indirect. The direct ways in which L.A. benefits from our project is by making less environmental impacts. L.A. also benefits from the  awareness and practice of environmentally friendly business improvements that donâ€™t require investments of over $1,000.  The indirect ways in which Los Angeles benefits from the proposed project is by creating a collaborative culture between environmental justice and business. Often, environmental justice organizations are thought of as wanting to keep business and industry out of their area.

Our organizing work has sustained a growing body of empowered parents that hold school systems accountable for providing children with the high quality education they deserve. </p><p>In 2010 we passed Californiaâ€™s historic Parent Trigger law. It gives a majority of parents with children trapped in a failing public school the right to transform it.</p><p>This year, our Desert Trails Elementary Parents Union Chapter is transforming their failing school in Adelanto, CA. Despite fierce opposition from their school district, they became the first parents in America to successfully implement the Parent Trigger law.</p><p>Our theory of change is working.</p><p>Our idea is to identify low performing schools within the L.A. Unified School District where we will organize parents into Parents Union Chapters to transform failing schools using the Parent Trigger Law.</p><p>Parents Union Chapters are the building block of our growing parent empowerment movement. They are structured parent organizations that choose to formally affiliate with us through a MOU.  Once a chapter is formed, we help parents evaluate the weaknesses within their schools and then organize to transform them using the Parent Trigger law  either as bargaining power or formally implementing one of its turnaround options. </p><p>By empowering a growing body of LA parents, we will positively impact the key factor that causes poor educational achievement  schools that fail to enthusiastically instill strong adult accountability policies. Our efforts will change schools that fall far short of adopting â€œkids firstâ€ educational agendas â€“ policies and procedures that stress a commitment to unwavering achievement and cultures of academic success. </p><p>Our project will help spur failing schools to enter a sustained era of reform   where informed, empowered and active parents exert meaningful powerful over the educational destiny of their children.</p><p>As the LA2050 study concludes, far too many parents with kids in LAUSD have no choice but to enroll their children in underperforming schools. In fact, approximately 220 LAUSD schools are eligible to be transformed under the Parent Trigger law. Many thousands of Los Angelesâ€™ parents are trapped into enrolling their children in neighborhood schools that fail to adequately educate their children.</p><p>Our current LAUSD Parent Trigger campaign is proving this point. This grant will help us to pursue a course that can improve the educational outcomes of thousands of deserving students. We will use our parent organizing skills to turn many failing LA schools into vibrant laboratories of learning.</p><p>We are off to a tremendous start   just see what parents are now doing at LAUSDâ€™s 24th Street Elementary School.</p><p>24th Street Elementary is one of the worst in LAUSD  and has been for many years. Itâ€™s in the bottom 2% of district elementary schools. It also has the second highest suspension rate (8%) of any elementary school in LAUSD â€“ a testament to its culture of low academic expectations.</p> <p>We helped 24th Street parents organize and learn how to wield their power within the Parent Trigger law in ways most likely to improve student outcomes. We also guided them through an education policy training program that helped them analyze school policies and practices and translate their understanding into actionable information to transform their school.</p> <p>In January, the 24th Street Parents Union made history  it launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. A total of 69% of school parents signed the petition.</p><p>LAUSD Superintendent John Deasy publicly praised the 24th Street Parents Union saying, ""I would love to have this kind of parent involvement at every school.â€ 


In February the LAUSD Board unanimously approved the parentsâ€™ petition. It was unprecedented â€“ and offers great hope for continued cooperation with LAUSD.</p><p>Here are some of the headlines: 


â€œFor the First Time, a Parent Trigger Without a Hitchâ€


 â€œL.A. School Board Approves Parent Trigger at 24th Street Elementaryâ€


24th Street parents have received four proposals from organizations seeking to transform troubled their troubled school starting this August.</p><p>One is a partnership between LAUSD and a charter school that neighbors 24th Street Elementary. This sends another important signal that LAUSD is poised to continue cooperating with our Parent Trigger law campaigns. </p><p>Weâ€™re optimistic that a new era of reform for LAUSD can begin. We will spark an â€œoutbreak of idealismâ€ that can motivate other parents to put stock in the Parent Trigger law as a means to transform many other lowperforming LAUSD schools.</p>








","LAUSD: Public School Choice





In 2009 our first major success was passing LAUSDâ€™s historic Public School Choice resolution. It opened up hundreds of failing and newly constructed campuses for bidding by quality charter school operators, teachers, and other nonprofits.





We ran a grassroots campaign that generated over 4,000 supportive postcards from parents and then organized 3,000 parents for a rally on the day of the vote. 





When we passed LAUSDâ€™s Public School Choice policy we gave birth to the parent empowerment movement.





The Parent Trigger Law





In January 2010 we passed Californiaâ€™s Parent Trigger law â€“ a concept far more powerful than Public School Choice. The law empowers a majority of parents at failing schools to transform them. 





The Parent Trigger law has reframed the public debate on the role organized and empowered parents can play in public school reform. 





Comptonâ€™s McKinley Elementary School Campaign





In December 2010 we helped parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA become the first to successfully use the Parent Trigger law by submitting signatures of over 61% of their schoolâ€™s parents. 





Parents Union Chapters and Policy Training





Parents Union Chapters are dedicated to improving educational outcomes at local schools through organizing and activism. A major project we undertake with each chapter is to  provide parents comprehensive education policy training to  help them formally evaluate the strengths and weaknesses within their schools. 





 â€œParent Power Expressâ€ Bus Tour





In September 2011, our â€œParent Power Expressâ€ bus tour made stops at our Los Angeles area chapters before ending in Sacramento. The tour showcased the incredible, important organizing work Parents Union Chapters are doing to transform their childrenâ€™s underperforming schools through the Parent Trigger law.


It was a hugely successful media campaign that promoted the continued expansion of growing parent empowerment movement. It proved that the work we started in L.A is on the cutting edge of the most dynamic school transformation movements in the country. 


Parent Trigger Law Regulations


In 2011, we completed a campaign to pass final State Board of Education Parent Trigger law regulations. We mobilized a powerful grassroots movement and generated supportive editorials from almost every major newspaper in California. 


Desert Trails Elementary School


In January 2012, parents launched the nationâ€™s 2nd Parent Trigger campaign. In January 2013 the Adelanto School Board finally complied with two court orders. This is the first time in the United States a school board voted to approve Parent Trigger implementation.  


LAUSDâ€™s 24th Street Elementary School


In January the 24th Street Elementary Parents Union Chapter  launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. 69% of school parents signed the petition. 


In February, on a 7 0 vote, the Board of Education unanimously approved the parentsâ€™ petition. ","<p>We often partner with other exceptional organizations so our work is informed by the latest research and evidencebased policy prescriptions. Though we have not entered into any formal agreements to collaborate with any groups on this project, we share closely aligned 


beliefs regarding education reform with each of these:</p>


<p>The Education Trust West works with the conviction that the single most important school based factor in improving student academic performance is the quality of the teacher in the classroom.</p> 


<p>Educators 4 Excellence (E4E) E4E works to ensure that the voices of classroom teachers are included in the decisions that affect teachers and their students. </p>





","Our strong belief in metricsdriven decisions requires us to conduct constant selfreflection, assessment, and evaluation of our work. Our organizing team uses a customized build of Salesforce.com, a very sophisticated customer relationship management database, to track our organizing metrics on a daily and weekly basis to meet our milestones and outcomes. 





They are constantly held accountable for their progress toward agreed upon goals, with strong oversight provided by our Organizing Director and management team. Additionally, organizers document their activities on a daily and weekly basis to ensure that future campaigns are guided by the successes, challenges, and lessons learned during this project. 





Also, our first Parent Trigger campaign in Compton, California resulted in perhaps our greatest learning experience and directly contributed to the implementation of our current organizing and evaluation models. In that campaign we selected one particular school to focus on, lead the petition signing campaign and also selected one charter school as a preferred option for the parentâ€™s consideration. 


","<p>For far too long, meaningful power in regards to education policy has essentially rested in the hands of distant school district management and teachers unions. This has led to policies that far too often make little or no sense for children trapped in Los Angelesâ€™ failing schools. </p> 





<p>We believe that fundamentally altering that power structure by introducing parents as real power players in a strategic way is the best way towards transformative policy change in public education, and each one of our strategies and tactics are geared towards accomplishing that endgame.</p>





<p>As we build a cadre of strong parent chapters across Los Angeles fighting for reforms at their childrenâ€™s lowperforming schools, we will simultaneously begin focusing on translating those chapters into a citywide movement for kidsfirst reforms in adult and school accountability, teacher effectiveness, college readiness, and other important areas.</p>  





<p>The first step in that process is to build strong horizontal relationships between our different chapters based on shared experiences and similar roadblocks they encounter in their Parent Trigger campaign efforts.</p>





<p>We are certain that as our Parents Union Chapters launch indistrict Parent Trigger efforts at their individual schools, other chapters across Los Angeles will consistently come up against similar roadblocks that are out of the hands of their local administrators or even their school district â€“ state rules that force layoffs based only on seniority or that prohibit meaningful accountability by immediately granting teachers tenure after only two years.</p<  





<p>We will be actively and constantly seizing on these opportunities to channel parentsâ€™ frustrations up to districtwide and statewide advocacy efforts, which will serve as a key facilitator of our parent empowerment movement building efforts. </p> 





<p>All the while, however, we work to build horizontal relationships between the different chapters to create advocacy alliances based on common problems they are encountering at their schools.  We thus very intentionally will use these chapters to build a local movement to advocate for key policy reforms on the district level always providing the type of sophisticated advocacy tools that are crucial for success by supplementing this grassroots movement with our organizationâ€™s proven skill sets in media, politics, and law. </p>





<p>This philosophy guides our approach, which uses the Parent Trigger in partnership with sophisticated community organizing techniques to build a powerful, parentbased, movement for education policy that puts kids first. </p> 





<p>Thousands of children that are trapped in Los Angelesâ€™ lowperforming schools will become lifetime beneficiaries of this approach to education reform.</p>





","Parent Power Demonstration Districts





If we and others that are vitally interested in parent empowerment as a means to transform failing public schools are successful, we will see an LA2050 where all Los Angles area school districts have been transformed into  â€œParent Power Demonstration Districtsâ€ that have ongoing, parentled campaigns for kids first education policy change.





These â€œParent Power Demonstration Districtsâ€ would be jurisdictions where parent empowerment organizing could produce transformative, districtwide change that is openly embraced by such districts. All students will then have access to a great public education if we successfully organize at both the school and district levels. 





However, there is one immense challenge  parents must overcome powerful interests that have yet to accept the legitimate role they can productively play in transforming failing schools. 





To obtain districtwide collective power, parents must receive districtwide leadership development opportunities, timely districtwide information and develop mechanisms to influence policymakers. Meeting these needs requires empowering parents with information and effective tools. 





Some solutions could include: 





â€¢	Developing a Parent Organizing & Leadership Training Academy  


â€¢	Publishing ""Parent Power Demonstration District"" rankings & data


â€¢	Establishing intradistrict Parent Union reform networks and alliances


â€¢	Engaging with and influence elected education & political leaders

We will also delve more deeply into how students, teachers, and parents see the effects by conducting indepth interviews with them using the following questions. It is very rewarding to know, through this empirical evidence, what we already knew in our hearts: that Participlay programs do, indeed, work and make an important difference in the lives of people and their communities.


","The fact is that the arts foster creativity, innovation, good health and happiness. 





National studies show that early and successful gateway arts experiences create lifelong participation in and enthusiasm for the arts. Yet the people of our communities, schools and afterschool programs are struggling with everincreasing funding challenges. 





Studies also show that individuals and families that play together create stronger positive bonds and a deeper experience of connectedness.





With the support of this LA2050 grant, Participlay can expand the reach of our art+play initiatives into the LA communities, bringing the opportunity to create individual and group artworks that are largely made of repurposed materials. 


 


Many of the neighborhoods we hope to serve, have ethnic and native language diversity and kids on the school lunch program. Others have rigorous academic programs, but limited opportunities for arts and creative expression.

Build Arts Audiences/Make the Arts Accessible


Engage Young People in Active, Handson Experiences


Train new Leaders & Mentoring Youth


Prepare Innovators for Tomorrow








","Success would look like that schools, families, individuals and children taking the time to make things, objects, crafts, and artworks with their own hands from the materials that they had around them--re-purposing everything into art.  Art+play initiatives would become an active part of everyday life. That groups within neighborhoods would come together to share of their experiences, regarding the works that they produced and create scheduled appointed times to dovetail this activity into the life of their community.

3102197,2013197,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/axsfestival.html,AxS aksis Festival,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"PROPOSED PROJECT:  Planning and development phase of AxS Festival.





BACKGROUND:  Art and science, left brain/right brain, STEM to STEAM â€“ across the country and around the world, artists and scientists are exploring the interconnectedness of the two domains, dissolving traditional borders and developing new vocabularies, and leaders in culture, media and business are focusing with deep interest on the artscience movement.  In Pasadena, a textured conversation between the sciences and the arts is ongoing, emblematic of the city's history, and is equally fused with the future.





Every three years, the Pasadena Arts Council (PAC) presents the AxS [aksis] Festival, a twoweek citywide celebration of art and science featuring exhibitions, performances and a conversation series which honors and reflects on the allied importance of both the arts and the sciences to the dynamic tenor of our time. While often described as occupying opposite ends of a spectrum, art and science are instead united in the AxS Festivalâ€™s recognition that both domains are powerful engines of contemporary culture.  A theme unique to each Festival is chosen which lends itself to interpretation by both disciplines and to consideration of profound questions of the human experience.





For the next festival, PAC has selected â€œCuriosityâ€ as its theme to honor the JPLbuilt Mars rover which reached its destination in August 2012 and began its 23month mission of surveying and analyzing the Martian surface.





AxS Festival | CURIOSITY explores the uncharted journey of artistic and scientific creativityâ€”the question, the experiment, the discovery.  From Pandoraâ€™s irresistible desire to look into the box to NASA/JPLâ€™s â€œCuriosityâ€ roving on the surface of Mars, human inquisitiveness defines our species and resonates powerfully through all works of art and scientific inquiry.  The festival will feature works from artists responding to the CURIOSITY theme, including dance and theater performances, multimedia and visual arts events, and provocative conversations by artists and thinkersâ€¦even a curiously amazing ArtScience fair for imaging minds of all ages.





AxS Festival will be presented at partner venues throughout the city, and for the first time AxScommissioned works will be housed in an arresting temporary pavilion, architectdesigned and built just for the Festival.  AxS Festival will be a twoweek expedition across terrain both ancient and familiar, guided by artists and scientists at the horizon of discovery.





In addition to the exhibitions, performances, lectures, workshops, tours and other festival activities, PAC will curate a special Conversation Series to more deeply investigate the core questions raised by the theme, and â€œCuriosityâ€ will ignite some of the most imaginative and thoughtprovoking AxS Festival Conversation to date.  Two of our most prominent thinkers will oversee the design of the Conversation Series: Dr. Michael E. Brown, the celebrated professor of planetary astronomy at California institute of Technology, and Dr. Daniel Lewis, Dibner Senior Curator of the History of Science and Technology and Chief Curator of Manuscripts at the renowned Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens.  





PROPOSED FOR My LA 2050: The period May 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, represents the planning and development phase for AxS Festival | CURIOSITY.  Primary among the benchmarks for this phase are the launch and completion of a pavilion design competition. An RFP will be issued, seeking an innovative design for a temporary popup pavilion to house commissions of new works for the Festival.  A final design will be chosen based on the most compelling design and innovative use of materials to complement the presentations, which will include the Curiously Amazing Festival of Stuff, presented by Machine Project (think Machine artists meet high school science fair) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Cabinet of Curiosities, in addition to other new works commissioned from multimedia dance and theater artists.





Other benchmarks during the project period include:


Completion of educational component developed by Jet Propulsion Lab.


New work commissions finalized and under way.


Completion of schedule and participants in Conversation Series.


Festival partner exhibitions and performances finalized.


Festival funding 8085% secured.


","AxS Festivals have examined the interplay of art and science since The Universeâ€ (2001), which contemplated manâ€™s place in the cosmos; â€œThe Tender Landâ€ (2004) meditated on the fragile complexity of the natural world; â€œSkinâ€ (2007) investigated culture, race and biology; â€œOriginsâ€ (2009), celebrating the bicentennial of Darwin's birth, explored the origins of creativity and questions of evolution, faith and the universe; and â€œFire and Waterâ€ (2011) explored the epic natural forces that have shaped human history and the landscape of this region.





In 2010, Pasadena Arts Council began conversations local leaders on the legacy and potential of Southern Californiaâ€™s arts and science assets â€“ assets, it was agreed, that distinguish the area in a unique way on a national basis and provide a framework for thinking about future economic and cultural development.   These conversations led to the notion of a â€œvision summit,â€ gathering together community leaders for an extended version of this conversation.  Later that year, a number of institutional and corporate leaders were invited to explore ideas for tapping the full potential of the unique fabric of arts and science. It was proposed that these intellectual and institutional assets define the region as a place where ideas and creativity abound, and that they reflect an unharnessed regional and national identity that can leverage the local economy, its cultural tourism, and its citizensâ€™ sense of pride and belonging.    





Pasadena Arts Council is also very proud of its EMERGE fiscal sponsorship program. This cultural entrepreneurship program currently incubates 60 individual projects and emerging organizations, offering them the ability to seek funding through fiscal sponsorship, and supporting participants during a crucial stage.  It provides an opportunity to develop a project and determine its trajectory with the guidance and oversight of an established nonprofit.â€‚ EMERGE supports artists who are launching new endeavors, those who are in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) determination, and also projects and programs that prefer to remain fiscally sponsored, making use of PACâ€™s nonprofit infrastructure to support their ongoing efforts. In FY 2013, PAC helped these projects raise over $800,000 and serve over 43,000 people, including 12,000 young people, through afterschool art and music programs, theater, dance and music performances, visual art exhibitions, public art commissions, literary and cultural festivals, photography and film projects and many other diverse, artistdriven projects throughout Southern California.





Pasadena Arts Council is the oldest arts service organization in California, established in 1964.  In 2014 we will celebrate our 50th anniversary, which we think is a pretty good achievement in itself.


","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Art Center College of Design, Huntington Library, Caltech, Kidspace Childrenâ€™s Museum, Descanso Gardens, Gamble House, Machine Project, Planetary Society, Armory Center for the Arts, Pasadena Museum of California Art, KPCC; other partners pending.","A basic indicator of the success of the AxS Festival will be measured by attendance at Festival events.  Audience surveys will be collected and compiled, as well as input from a debriefing of festival partners on what went well and what needed improvement in terms of their partner experience.





More important, however, will be an evaluation of how well the AxS movement takes hold in Los Angeles over the longer term.  PAC currently works with a consultant on developing elements for the â€œCity of Art and Scienceâ€ initiative (see next section), and this consultant will survey the cultural and creative landscape in Los Angeles for further artscience collaborations.  She will also suggest pilot programs for local schools and social service agencies.  Ultimately, it is hoped that the artscience movement reaches further into work with institutions and government on a new civic model, to bootstrap resources for an entire community.  At that point success may be measured on new or increased funding support for AxS programs, successes in sectors where pilot programs are implemented, and even graduation rates from STEAM academies.





Moreover, attention is increasingly being paid to what Professor Ann Markusen calls â€œcreative placemaking.â€  In a study commissioned by the NEA, Markusen states: â€œIn creative placemaking, partners from public, private, nonprofit, and community sectors strategically shape the physical and social character of a neighborhood, town, city, or region around arts and cultural activities. Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces, rejuvenates structures and streetscapes, improves local business viability and public safety, and brings diverse people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired.â€  This collaborative, crosssector thinking perfectly embodies the AxS movement, and these outcomes are measurable on a local level, even neighborhood by neighborhood.


"," In 1984, the world came to Los Angeles. Mostly they came for the Summer Olympics, but many also experienced  stunning performances by artists of international caliber during the Olympic Arts Festival; Robert Grahamâ€™s monumental Olympic Gateway sculptures still tower over Memorial Coliseum as a reminder of what a great festival can mean to a great city. In 1984, Los Angeles dismissed those Orwellian connotations and instead took its place among the great international art cities â€“ a city of the future. This celebration of arts and culture was followed at threeyear intervals thereafter through 1993 as the Los Angeles Festival, which continued the tradition of artistic innovation and excellence, introducing a littleknown Canadian company called Cirque du Soleil alongside master artists like Peter Brook and local standouts like Lula Washington.





Now, 20 years after the last Los Angeles Festival, the AxS [aksis] Festival brings to the Los Angeles area not just a dynamic public event but a bold challenge to cultural, business and civic leaders to engage with the artscience movement and allow Los Angeles to lay its claim as the movementâ€™s energy center. 





Increasingly complex challenges of the 21st century will be best addressed by crosssector dialogue and innovation. The artscience movement, with its multidisciplinary emphasis, will have a ripple effect through the region as it demonstrates what is possible when intellectual capital is harnessed. Several indicators of the quality of life in Los Angeles could be impacted by art and science coming together both as a festival and as a civic initiative.





The quality of education in the Los Angeles area is dismal and getting worse every year. With its emphasis on STEM to STEAM, the educational components of the artscience movement will propose muchneeded strategies to better leverage creative and innovative capital and invest it in the schools. Since STEM to STEAM is increasingly a part of the national dialogue on education, AxS will help attract federal funding to launch these programs in local schools. Creative endeavor has long been recognized to enhance learning and improve graduation rates, resulting in a better prepared workforce. 


The cultural vitality of the region is projected to decline over the next decades, the only indicator with this discouraging trend and caused by the lack of a coherent artsnurturing policy. The AxS Festival would establish Los Angeles as the center of a vibrant new movement, one with the potential to catalyze resources and realize powerful outcomes. Taking a page from the High Line project in New York, creative teams would be tasked with creating alternative park spaces in underresourced neighborhoods and communicating messages about healthy living. Putting crossdisciplinary programs like Art Center College of Designâ€™s Designmatters at the forefront, sustainable solutions to environmental challenges will be developed which address scalable outcomes.","Thirtyseven years from now, eleven more AxS Festivals will have taken place, and with each successive festival a greater number of Angelenos have been captivated, enlightened and engaged by the transformational power of the artistic and scientific creative process.  Los Angeles is the hypocenter of a new cultural/educational environment which fosters the degree of innovation necessary to address the increasing complexities of life in the new midcentury, and imaginative partnerships have been established among cultural, research, educational, social service, government and corporate entities.  Every unified school district in Los Angeles County has a STEAM academy.  On the website of the Mayor of Los Angeles, in the â€œIssuesâ€ section a tab for â€œSTEAMâ€ has been added to those for Transportation, Public Safety, Environment, Job Creation, Housing, Balanced Budget, Clean Tech, Education and Gang Reduction, and the heads of each of those divisions meet regularly with STEAM advisors for inspired, solutionbased brainstorming.  Meanwhile, the AxS Festival has taken its place among the most eagerly anticipated international cultural events, and 2050 is a festival year, the twelfth festival to have taken place since the My LA 2050 initiative was launched.  A special commemorative look back to 2014 and the Curiosity rover is organized, putting into context all that we have learned about Mars in the intervening decades.  Interdisciplinary artscientists working at the furthest margins of discovery are invited to create new work for the 2050 AxS Festival, which is presented at venues around the region, including the Getty, UCLA, Art Center College of Design and Otis College of Art and Design, the Huntington Library, LACMA, Caltech, JPL, Carnegie Observatories, USC, the Natural History Museum, the California Science Center and many others.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is a major supporter of the AxS Initiative, as is SpaceX.  Artists have taken their rightful place alongside scientists, engineers, and business entrepreneurs as change agents and California now ranks in the top 10 states in terms of per capita spending on arts and culture.  And a 46yearold woman who came to the AxS Festival as a fourthgrader is heading up the Governorâ€™s task force on arts, culture, science and technology."
3102198,2013198,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/POV.html,Childrens Counseling Program at POV, Public Safety,"We are committed to the Children's Program as a means to create an environment of safety and healing for children ages 3 and up who have witnessed or experienced sexual or domestic violence. The Childrenâ€™s Program will use a variety of cutting edge therapeutic, cognitive and somatic methods that are based on research and evidenced based successes for children's mental health and well being (e.g., play/expressive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, support groups, etc.). The Center is distinguished by its primary focus on the engagement of children and youth and its secondary focus on those who care for them. 





POV will expand its mental health treatment services by establishing expert, clinical staff who will work with child witnesses and victims so that they can heal from the trauma they have experienced, increase levels of trust and support in their lives, and reorient to a â€œnew normalâ€ of violence free lives. This work will impact the public safety indicator by disrupting intergenerational cycles of violence and the consequences of unaddressed traumaagression, involvement in criminal activity, community and interpersonal violence, drug and alcohol abuse, risky sexual behaviors, and suicidal ideation. 





The Children's Program will be highlighted as an exceptional program within POV's Children and Youth Center. In September 2012, Peace Over Violence  expanded its downtown Los Angeles headquarters by opening a Children and Youth Center. The Center currently houses POV's youth violence prevention programs, including POV's Youth Over Violence Summer Institute and Internship Program which trains 25 emerging leaders on understanding the roots of violence, media literacy education, and violence prevention strategies. Youth then participate in paid internships where they design social media apps for violence prevention, construct and implement community assessments on violence and design and strategize methods for peer involvement in violence prevention and building healthy relationships. 


","Peace Over Violence has been a leader in advocacy for victims of violence since the early 1970â€™s, when it established a rape crisis hotline, prevention training and advocacy for women who had been assaulted. In 1976, the organization expanded the hotline to include counseling for victims of domestic violence. Over the years, Peace Over Violence has evolved beyond oneonone intervention in sexual assaults and domestic abuse, toward onebyone prevention of youth violence and child abuse, serving over 22,000 individuals a year. A leader in advocacy for victims of violence, Peace Over Violence played a major role in the acknowledgement of rape, battering, and stalking as crimes, changes to criminal procedure to respect the rights of victims, the development of antiviolence policies and curricula, and the training of emergency room and other medical personnel to recognize and intervene in cases of domestic violence and rape. POVâ€™s national Denim Day in LA & USA sexual violence prevention education campaign registered over 5 million participants in 2012, in all 50 states and in 117 foreign countries.





In our four decades of service, survivors, volunteers and staff have identified the following consistent needs: culturally and linguistically appropriate crisis intervention services; long term therapeutic services for children exposed to and directly impacted by violence; effective primary prevention approaches that reduce risk and eliminate violence among youth and within families; and the need for comprehensive, no cost legal services to meet the unique needs of immigrant and youth survivors of domestic and sexual violence. 





POV has responded to these needs through developing new, innovative programming integrating feedback and input from the target population. In 1987, we established our Deaf and Disabled Services programthe first in the nation to address deaf/disabled survivor needswith representatives of the Deaf community who began a crisis hotline delivered via a TDD and inperson services delivered in ASL. In 1991, In Touch With Teens was conceived out of the understanding among youth that their dating relationships contained the same power/control dynamics as adult married couples; and youth acted as leaders in peer education, prevention and advocacy activities. In 2000, we established the Legal Advocacy Project, which provides free civil legal services to address survivors' family and immigration law matters. In 2008, we began to provide weekly violence prevention education groups and direct intervention services to former gang members through our ties with Homeboy Industries. In 2011, our advocacy efforts resulted in the Los Angeles Unified School District passing a Teen Dating Violence Prevention Policy for the entire school district.





 ","Peace Over Violence's Domestic Abuse and Sexual Assault Response Teams (who respond to child survivors) maintain formal partnerships with the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast and Hollenbeck Divisions, the San Gabriel Valley Medical Center, and Los Angeles County USC Hospital.  Children responded to will be referred for counseling.





POV operates the only Deaf and Disabled Program for survivors of domestic and sexual violence in Southern California. It partners closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services to meet the needs of deaf children and adults who have been assaulted. 





POV will receive mentoring and guidance from LA Child Guidance Clinic counseling program.  ","The overarching goal of The Childrenâ€™s Program is to recognize the profound effect of interpersonal violence on the lives of children exposed to domestic violence and sexual assault, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of intervention and prevention services to heal the trauma of these experiences.





Peace Over Violence will use standardized models to measure the impact of the program on the participantsâ€™ mental health, quality of life, academic performance, health and physical status, alcohol and drug use, and other domains. Peace Over Violence will utilize quantitative and qualitative data to assess the effectiveness of the program. Information compiled from surveys of both the service providers and recipients will provide indicators pointing to program successes, challenges and outcomes. ","The Childrenâ€™s Program addresses two critical needs in Los Angeles: (1) the need for services that help children heal from the effects of witnessing relationship violence, thus breaking the intergenerational cycle of violence; and (2) the need for services to be inclusive of boys and men in a service sector that has previously focused primarily on meeting the needs of women.





There is a tremendous gap in services in Los Angeles specifically directed to reversing the longterm effects that children who witness or experience family violence endure.  By establishing an independent program for these children, POV will meet an important need â€“ one with longterm implications for the health and safety of the children who will be healed, and their future families.  Research over a 20 year period consistently demonstrates a direct relationship between witnessing or experiencing domestic violence as a child, and adopting high risk behaviors later in life. With the input of mental health professionals, POV has reviewed literature on how violence affects the brains of children and youth who witness it or are victims, and how this damage can be healed. POV staff members will optimize the latest treatment modalities recommended by experts in the field that are designed to help heal the affects of violence and posttraumatic stress disorder in children. 





Over the years, POV has become increasingly aware of the ways in which men and boys are affected by relationship and sexual violence, and has reached out to include men on the staff and in the leadership of our programs, including the involvement of boys in our youth leadership programs. We are especially concerned that 1 in 6 boys are identified as victims of child sexual abuse and few services are available to address this trauma.  The Children's Program will provide free counseling services to meet the needs of boys and their families.  


By serving child victims in the context of a comprehensive approach to prevent intimate violence, we believe more young people will seek treatment for their abuse at an earlier age. This will transform their lives in a way that nurtures compassion and caring rather than perpetuation of the cycle of abuse.


","Our manifesto states: Our vision is a world without violence. Where no child is abused, no wife battered, no friend raped. A world without terror, without threats, without wounds from intentional actions. Where the strong provide for the vulnerable, where the vulnerable become empowered, where every kind of family is safe and secure, and girls and boys and women and men have a fair and equal chance at the pursuit of happiness in a tolerant and talented society.





Peace Over Violenceâ€™s approach toward realizing this vision is to enact effective intervention services, teach violence prevention, and build leadership for future activism. We listen, counsel, support, guide and work to heal survivors of violence.  We empower, educate and advocate so that all members of our community can take a stand and be leaders by living lives free from violence.  Success in 2050 would be marked by adequate resources for those who have suffered from violence as well as by a strong core of leaders who practice violence prevention and consider violence as an intolerable condition for the residents of Los Angeles.

3102199,2013199,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/peerhealthexchange.html,Empowering Teens with the Knowledge and Skills to Make Healthy Decisions, Health,"<p>Peer Health Exchange was founded to address a growing crisis: teenagers today are engaging in risky behavior at alarming rates, harming their bodies and their futures. In Los Angeles,</p>


<p>â€¢	1 in 5 teens is a binge drinker</p>


<p>â€¢	2 in 5 are sexually active; & 39% of these teens did not use a condom the last time they had sex


<p>â€¢	Nearly 1 in 5 indicate that they have never been taught in school about AIDS or HIV infection</p>


<p>â€¢	More than 1 in 10 has been physically abused by a boyfriend or girlfriend</p>


<p>â€¢	1 in 10 has attempted suicide</p>





<p>(All stats used: 2011 Los Angeles Youth Risk Behavior Survey)</p>





<p>These serious health problems are in large part the result of teens lacking the tools they need to prevent them. In recent years, public schoolsâ€™ increased focus on academic testing combined with budget cuts & staffing shortages have exacerbated this crisis by eliminating health courses in many schools. Many teens are not receiving comprehensive health education in this critical setting, & increasing numbers are left unprepared to protect themselves against the serious health risks they face. Teens who engage in risky behavior today are more likely to struggle or drop out of school, enter the criminal justice system, or live in poverty.</p>


<p>Peer Health Exchangeâ€™s mission is to give teenagers the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. We do this by training college students to teach a health curriculum in public high schools that lack comprehensive health education & in which a majority of students qualify for free/reduced lunch. Our vision is to build a health education organization that serves teens nationwide in order to give as many teens as possible the knowledge & skills they need to make healthy decisions. We are a national nonprofit founded in 2003, & began serving LA County in 2009. Since then, we have trained more than 750 college student volunteers to provide health education to over 8,800 low-income teens in LAUSD high schools.</p>


<p>Peer Health Exchange (PHE) has a unique 4-part program model: 


<p>1.	PHE partners with LAUSD high schools that lack health education and where the majority of the students live at or below the poverty line. These students experience a disproportionate number of serious health risks, ranging from teenage pregnancy to obesity. </p>


<p>2.	PHE recruits, selects and rigorously trains college students to teach a year-long health curriculum in these schools, consisting of 13 standardized health workshops on topics ranging from decision-making and communication, sexual health, pregnancy prevention, substance abuse prevention, healthy vs. abusive relationships, sexual assault prevention, mental health, and nutrition and physical activity. Over the 2012-2013 academic year, PHE Los Angeles is partnering with four colleges (University of California, Los Angeles, University of Southern California, California State University Northridge, and Occidental College) and 22 public high schools in the LA area. We plan to expand to serve even more LAUSD schools in the coming year, and estimate that we will reach 3,600 teens with 300 volunteers in the 2013-2014 school year. We are also piloting expansions of our program model, including training teens as health educators and affecting the entire school culture to support health and wellness. The latter initiative includes interventions like organizing school-wide health fairs and providing follow-up workshops for our host teachers to continue the dialogue with students after our volunteers have presented our program.</p>


<p>3.	PHE gives teenagers the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. In the classroom, PHE high school students articulate their values and goals, learn basic, accurate health information, explore attitudes and perceptions of peer norms and peer pressure, analyze the influence of culture and the media on health, discuss barriers to healthy behaviors and strategies to overcome them, and identify and learn how to use the health resources in their communities. By addressing teen pregnancy prevention, common mental health issues such as depression, and substance abuse prevention, our program not only helps teens protect their health, but also supports them in their path to high school graduation (research has shown that unplanned pregnancy, mental health issues and substance abuse are three factors that directly hinder high school studentsâ€™ progress to graduation).</p>


<p>4.	PHE fosters a commitment to public service in LA college students, directly engaging them communities beyond their campus, and preparing them to serve as leaders in their communities throughout their lives. Many of these volunteers will go on to be doctors, teachers, public interest lawyers, and policymakers who maintain a commitment to serving low-income communities in Los Angeles thanks to the insights and experiences gained during their service with Peer Health Exchange.</p>","<p>Since our founding in 2003, we have trained more than 6,200 college student volunteers to deliver effective health education to over 76,000 low-income public high school students in New York City, Boston, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. This year, we reach 19,000 teens across six cities. </p>





<p>Peer Health Exchange grew to Los Angeles in 2009. Since then, we have trained more than 750 college student volunteers to provide health education to over 8,800 low-income Angelinos.</p>





<p>This year, PHE Los Angeles is piloting several unique strategic investments as part of our larger organizational growth plan, including:</p>





<p>1)        Accessibility of PHE Program for Volunteers: This investment aims make PHE more accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds by making additions and adaptations to our program model, including changing the organizational structure, incentivizing PHE through course credit or stipends, and adjusting the training structure to make it accessible to all learning styles. We are piloting this investment at Cal State Northridge.</p>





<p>2)        School Environment: Extended Teen Learning: This investment will test whether addressing the overall school environment in which teens operate impacts their learning around health behaviors.  We are working closely with teachers, administrators, and other external organizations partnering with pilot schools to co-construct interventions through multiple modalities beyond the 13 standard PHE workshops. We are piloting this investment at selected LA high schools.</p>","Next year, we will continue to draw our volunteer corps from UCLA, USC, Occidental College and Cal State Northridge. In 2012-13, we partner with 22 LAUSD high schools, reaching 100 ninth grade classrooms. Next year, we will expand to more schools, reaching 120 classrooms. Current partners include Partnership for LA Schools, LA Alliance College-Ready Schools, Green Dot, ICEF Public Schools, The Accelerated School, Big Picture Learning, Bright Star Schools, LA Leadership Academy, and additional charter schools. This year we also partnered with a community organizations to provide extended training to our volunteers, including Planned Parenthood LA, YWCA of Greater LA and Tarzana Treatment Center. We will grow our community partners next year.","<p>To increase PHE high school studentsâ€™ ability to make healthy decisions. PHE uses a pre- and post-test survey administered to PHE high school students before and after the program to assess their knowledge of the health topics we address. </p>





<p>In 2011-2012, PHE Los Angeles high school students made statistically significant increases in their health knowledge, with a 19 percentage point improvement in health knowledge, representing 51% growth from Pre-Test to Post-Test. </p>





<p>In the 2012-2013 year, we are continuing to measure knowledge growth, and are expanding our evaluation methods to measure our impact on teen behavior for the first time, using a scientific program evaluation including a control group, led by an external evaluator.</p>





<p>To measure our success in building a commitment to public service in PHE college student volunteers, we administer a program evaluation to our college student volunteers to assess their experience in the program and how it has affected their future plans. Last year, 75% percent of PHE college student volunteers said that their volunteer experience had already affected their future career or educational plans. Our goal for 2012-2013 is to have more than 75% of PHE Los Angeles volunteers express interest in continuing to pursue public interest educations or careers in the future.</p>","Many LAUSD schools are opting to forego the traditional 9th grade semester-long health class, instead absorbing the minimum mandated CA Education Code HIV/AIDS prevention education into advisory or science classes. Our program is a free service to schools, and includes not only HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness education, but also education on a number of topics that have the potential to impact high school graduation rates, public safety (such as sexual assault and intimate partner violence), and the overall health and wellness of low-income communities in LA. We also increase civic participation and social connectedness in LA County by engaging college students in the communities beyond their campuses.","More adults are empowered to make healthy decisions, and know how to support teens in their lives to do the same. Public safety, health and social connectedness have all improved, and more people understand the impact and efficacy of peer education in supporting community and individual health. "
3102200,2013200,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/frontlineleaders.html,Front Line Leaders Academy: Creating  Change that Lasts, Social Connectedness,"The Front Line Leaders Academy (FLLA) is a program of People For the American Way Foundation, a nonpartisan educational organization founded in 1981 to promote and defend the American values of liberty and equality for all, and to ensure that the promises enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are made real for all members of our pluralistic society.  As part of PFAW Foundationâ€™s youth leadership programs, FLLA is an advanced leadership training program that bridges the gap between Young People For, our program for training campus leaders and the Young Elected Officials Network, our nonpartisan network of progressive young electeds.  FLLA specifically addresses the growing demand to engage, equip, and empower young progressives (1835) with the skills and strategies to move into positions of local leadership and to support them as they prepare for involvement in local campaigns within their communities. 





We propose, in response to the My LA2050 challenge, to implement a Los Angelesbased Front Line Leaders Academy for 20 young, emerging leaders from low income, LGBTQ and communities of color in Los Angeles County.  For six months these fellows will participate in trainings on a wide range of leadership development and political skills, including how to be an effective candidate, campaign management, finance, communications, and field organizing. 





The 20 young leaders will be recruited by Young People For in May for the LAbased Front Line Leaders Academy.  Then, from June through December 2013, these FLLA fellows will participate in a series of workshops led by campaign experts, along with members of the Young Elected Officials Network.  Motivated by their strong will for public service, fellows will work with these young elected officials and campaign experts during four threeday convenings, conference calls, online trainings, and in oneonone sessions aimed at monitoring the progress of each fellow.  By graduation, FLLA fellows will have developed a wide range of campaign skills, and will have compiled a complete campaign book that will enable them to be effective local leaders.     





Through their participation in the LAbased Front Line Leaders Academy, these 20 youth will be educated on progressive issues, including civic engagement, and connected to each other, asked to participate civically, provided with role models who are civically engaged, and encouraged to network with others and discuss their experiences with others. 





Curriculum for the trainings will include public speaking, building personal narrative, basebuilding, message development, and management.  In addition, we will identify LAbased campaign experts and community partners to offer sessions on best practices and lessons learned in local work on education, civic participation, the environment, and health, among others.  





The Front Line Leaders Academy was launched in 2006 by PFAW Foundation and trains 20 emerging leaders each year.  The Academy is responsible for launching the careers of over 100 civic participants, many of whom have run for public office or served in some capacity on political campaigns or community organizing.  These young leaders are providing a vital infusion of ideas, energy, and passion to the progressive community, and their commitment to continued activism and leadership is critical to building a progressive future for cities around the country, including Los Angeles.  What most of these emerging leaders need is a catalyst to channel their own potential and support in sustaining their connection to the progressive movement.  We believe there is a place for these 20 Front Line Leaders Academy fellows to make a difference in Los Angeles.   


","As young leaders across the country prepare to run for office and lead campaigns, FLLA graduates are equipped with the skills they need to be successful and contribute to the progressive movement and to the success of the nation.  Since 2006, the Front Line Leaders Academy has graduated over 100 fellows from the program. 





We measure success of our longterm programming by the ultimate goal of empowering young people to become even more effective leaders who are making real change in their communities.  And Front Line Leaders Academy alumni are leading their communities as nonprofit leaders, campaign experts, organizers, and serving in elected positions; 70 percent of FLLA alumni have gone on to work for campaigns (many supporting the campaigns of their peers or working together) and 20 percent have run for elected office.  





Some examples of FLLA graduates moving their ideas into action include:  Jon Hoadley, Founder of Bandlands Strategies LLC, Campaign Manager of One Kalamazoo, and former Executive Director of the National Stonewall Democrats; Adam Connor, Manager of Public Policy in Facebookâ€™s Washington, DC office; and Karrianna Turner Marshall (Founder of Twenty â€˜20â€™ Something).  Eight FLLA alumni have also been elected to public office, becoming members of the Young Elected Officials Network:  Ezra Temko, Delaware City Council;  Anders Ibsen, Tacoma City Council; Mike Simmons, Brennemann Elementary School Local School Council in Chicago, IL;  Angie Buhl, South Dakota State Senator; Kevin Killer, South Dakota House of Representatives; Mike Makarski, Secaucus, New Jersey School Board Member; LaDawn BlackettJones, Georgia State House of Representatives; and Stefanie Mach, Arizona State House of Representatives.


","PFAW Foundationâ€™s collaborators in Los Angeles are organizations that already part of our partners and that help us to recruit, train and connect participants in all of our youth leadership programs, which include Young People For, Young Elected Officials Network, and the Front Line Leaders Academy.  These partners include the UCLA Center For Community College Partnerships Program; the Blue/Green Alliance; Californians for Justice; CuÃ©ntame; California Collective for Reproductive Justice; IDEAS. Additionally, through this LAbased Front Line Leaders Academy we intend to build relationships with community based organizations, the statewide student association, local elected officials, and movement leaders. ","Success will be measured by the competency achieved by the individual FLLA fellows who are trained.  This assessment takes place during graduation weekend.  





For the candidacy assessment, fellows are required to give a threeminute stump speech, which they work on over the course of the training.  The stump speech must to be memorized, tell their personal story, showcase a well thought out platform, and contain a hard ask for a vote. 





For the campaign management assessment, fellows are required to present their completed campaign plans to a panel of PFAW Foundation staff, YEOs, and FLLA alumni who act as a third party organization trying to decide whether or not to endorse the fellowâ€™s â€œcampaign.â€  The campaign plans are required to be comprehensive, realistic, and executable.  During their presentations, fellows summarize their plans for the panel, discuss how they plan to fulfill the administrative aspects of managing, and answer questions from the panel to defend the choices they had made in their plans. 





For the communications assessment, fellows are divided into small groups of three.  The small groups are given a hypothetical scenario where they have to develop a communications strategy for a candidate running for the state legislature in a hypothetical location.  The small groups are directed to pick a stance on a hypothetical issue, design a communications strategy for the candidateâ€™s campaign based on that stance, and be prepared to deliver that message in all possible media outlets.  Fellows are assessed on their ability to stay on message and avoid being led astray by the evaluators who act as reporters. 





For the field organizing assessment, fellows again work in small groups and use the same hypothetical scenario (as in the communications assessment) to develop a field plan for the candidate.  The groups are provided with detailed information on the candidateâ€™s personal, professional, and political life, as well as information on their primary and general election opponents and background information on the fictional district and race. The groups are challenged to use the hard facts and context clues in the scenario to develop a field plan that was comprehensive, realistic, executable, and winnable in the context of the scenario. 





For the finance assessment, fellows are directed to raise a minimum of $250 to help support the FLLA program for the next class of fellows.  As part of the assessment, fellows are given strict donation limits and other rules by which they would be held accountable.  Rules include restrictions on inkind contributions, finance reports for both donations and expenditures, and deadlines for submitting finance reports. Fellows are assessed on their ability to meet deadlines, adhere to finance rules, and raise the minimum amount.


","Los Angelesâ€™ population is aging but has historically been relatively youthful in comparison to the rest of the country.  Research by CIRCLE, a leader on youth civic education and engagement, shows that â€œlow levels of conventional measures of civic engagement among noncollege youth translate into inequalities in political and civic participation by race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geography.â€  





The LAbased Front Line Leaders Academy we are proposing  will empower a new, emerging generation of Angelenos to connect with  their communities and work on their own campaign book, which addresses a problem or issue in Los Angeles; engages the greater Los Angeles community; cultivates a progressive community; and builds emerging activists into lifelong contributors to Los Angeles. 





Through this project Los Angeles will be infused with diverse, young civic participants who bring new and innovative ideas and are active in determining the policies, practices, and institutions by which they will seek community improvement that will create opportunities which ensure that youth remain in and contribute to the Los Angeles community over the longterm. ","We define success as: 


 Fellows sufficiently represented in positions of power in Los Angeles public, private and nonprofit sectors through access to resources and opportunities to effect change.





 The selection of a progressively more diverse class of fellows through improving the quality of candidates in FLLA by deepening the nominator network and adding a stronger network of community colleges and noncollege youth to the selection pool.





 Relationships developed with Los Angeles community based organizations that host networking and training events for fellows, help them find internships and opportunities and provide mentorship; and build and maintain relationships in Los Angeles.

3102201,2013201,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/KidsPlayatPS.html,Kids Play at Pershing Square, Environmental Quality,"The Pershing Square Park Advisory Board (PAB) is seeking funding for the design, planning and installation of a playground in Pershing Square Park in Downtown Los Angeles. Pershing Square is a City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks outdoor concert and event center which serves the community as a recreation center.


With the addition of a playground at Pershing Square the community can continue to meet the growing needs of its youngest residents. Playgrounds provide crucial and vital opportunities for children to play. There is substantial research showing the clear link between play and brain development, motorskills, and social capabilities. All learningâ€”emotional, social, motor and cognitiveâ€”is accelerated, facilitated, and fueled by the pleasure of play. Playgrounds that promote different types of play are vital for a childâ€™s cognitive, emotional, physical, and social development.





Playgrounds provide a safe environment designed specifically to foster and enhance the opportunities for a child to play alone, with a caregiver, or with other children. Given the importance of play in the development of a child, any space which gives a child free reign to do just that should be seen a crucial component in a childâ€™s life and in the continued growth and development of oneâ€™s community.





Quite simply, the addition of a playground to Pershing Square will improve the quality of life for the downtown community.


","PERSHING SQUARE DOWNTOWN STAGE 


The 40â€™ X 20' Pershing Square Downtown Stage is a performance space which presents free concerts available for local artists and is the venue for the Parkâ€™s Friday Night Flicks, the Summer Concert Series.  





SUMMER CONCERT SERIES 


Pershing Square's Downtown Stage is a unique outdoor concert and event center, operated by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. Located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, the venue hosts a free summer concert series for six weeks with entertainment four days a week, featuring a variety of music with local, national and international artists. The program runs July through August, Thursday through Sunday.  The Downtown Stage has become a premier summer concert venue with state of the art lighting and sound systems. The Downtown Stage provides a great opportunity to music fans by providing great talent for free and allowing both artists and sponsors the opportunity to give back to community.





FRIDAY NIGHT FLICKS


Each spring, summer and fall over 25 free movies are shown at Pershing Square every Friday night from May through October. Patrons are encouraged to pack a picnic, bring a blanket or lawn chair and watch movies in Pershing Square Park.  Films are shown on a 20' foot inflatable screen.





FARMERS MARKET 


The Farmers Market includes over 100 booths offering a variety of fresh, local produce and food offerings every Wednesday from 7:00am to 2:00pm. Specialty items such as jewelry and clothing are also available for purchase. The market allows the community another opportunity to meet friends and neighbors at Pershing Square. It also extends a welcome atmosphere to our farming community in other parts of Los Angeles.





FREE MOBILE YOUTH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING AND SUMMER CAMP


Pershing Square Mobile Youth Team takes programming to underserved youth at pocket parks throughout the City.  Recreation and Parks staff works out of City vans stuffed with games, toys, arts & crafts and sports equipment and coordinates fun after school leisure activities and providing homework help. This spring, Mobile Youth will be hosting it annual Extravaganza Spring Egg Hunt at Pershing Square. The event will host free arts and crafts, inflatables, age appropriate egg hunts. The mobile youth team serves over 100 children a week in the after school program. The day camp provides summer fun for 100 children a day. Youth events at Pershing Square number close to 1000 per event.

","We measure all of our programs by quality, not by quantity. Itâ€™s not how large of an audience or how much of an end result that is important, not how many people are affected, but rather the quality of the effect. We are successful by insuring a safe, comfortable, positive experience for our community. We are successful when our neighborsâ€™ children interact with each other and invite their families and friends to join.","The PAB wants to establish a place for kids to be outdoors, dream, play and learn to work with others. So whether kids are playing on the playground swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets, it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow.  A playground is a wonderful place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running are good for children both physically and emotionally. Taking time away from structured activity is an important part of keeping a child wellrounded and healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to dream, relax and learn to work with others.  By nurturing our children in this way, we help create a healthier community.





Downtown Los Angeles has a changing demographic with 50,000 new residents and a growing number of children.  Currently, here is no playground for them to play, dream and learn.  We want to fill that void.


","If we were able to transport to the realization of our vision of Pershing Square in 2050, we would find a reestablishment of the â€œLiving Roomâ€ of Downtown Los Angeles. In the mid 1800's, the park was the center of family life and provided the local residents with a social gathering place of shaded walks and topical foliage, a community retreat. In the next decades as the city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of structural modifications designed to attract visitors to our growing city. After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue visitors, and tourists.


Pershing Square's South and Southwest kiosks will be childrenâ€™s play areas serving the residential families in Downtown, South and East LA. This common area for children and their parents will provide a friendly oasis for family fun. The current Pershing Square cafe will transition to a full service restaurant to provide a social gathering stop to tourists and the community.





Across from the cafe, the ""Art Squared Gallery"" will provide a changing platform for the works of local and international artists, and provide a cultural exhibit of our beautiful city's artistic contributions. 





On the Northwest kiosk, chess and checker games boards will be available for leisure game activity, as well as programmed tournament activity.





The Northeast side of the Square will have an extended urban wall garden curated by the Pershing Square staff and community members. Jasmine roses, and other native flowers and plants will enhance the ambiance of the area and highlight the public perception of LA's intrinsic natural environment. 





Our tradition of free summer concerts will continue, with the performances presented on a world class iconic stage. The new structure will incorporate cutting edge lighting and sound equipment which will enable the City to attract high level artists and performers as well as loyal patrons of the venue.





""Downtown On Ice"", the outdoor ice skating rink at Pershing Square, will expand to accommodate twice the number of participants. Both the Summer stage and Winter ice rink will have established our new Pershing Square as an outstanding Los Angeles entertainment destination.





All of the above projections will enhance the quality of life for the Los Angeles population. Further it will optimize the Cityâ€™s image to international visitors and diplomatic guests.





The children and grandchildren of the kids using the playground today would still be enjoying this wonderful part of the park.

3102202,2013202,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Bresee.html,College Bus: Driving LAâ€™s LowIncome Youth Towards a College Education, Education,"<p><b>""A Bresee college trip changed my life by making me decide to go to college,""</b> describes Fonda Whitehead, a Bresee alumna who went on a college trip in 1988. ""No one in my family attended college, but that trip made it a reality for me."" Fonda, who has now worked at Bresee for 16 years, describes what has become a common story; the story of how a simple Bresee college trip can change lives.</p>





<p>Bresee proposes <b>a fullservice college prep program</b> that systematically targets the entire 450member student body of Central City Value High School (CCVHS), a local charter school. Every student will board Bresee's newly renovated, 25passenger College Bus, and spend a day touring a local college. Throughout the school year, every student will have the opportunity to take their college dreams a step further by enrolling in:</p>





<ul>


<li>AG requirement workshops for 9th grade</li>


<li>PSAT classes for 10th grade</li>


<li>PSAT/SAT prep, remedial CAHSEE prep and personal statement workshops for 11th grade</li>


<li>SAT prep, scholarship and FAFSA workshops, and the opportunity to apply for a needsbased College Bus scholarship for the 12th grade</li>


</ul>





<p>Programs will be available on the school's campus, for free, to all students. <b>This is a pilot program that is scalable and can be replicated at other schools in our community.</b> What if by 2050, every student in Los Angeles (LA) was afforded the same opportunity, the opportunity to overcome educational barriers and go to college? Join us on the campaign. Get aboard the College Bus.</p>





<p>Bresee serves an area where local high schools have graduation rates ranging from 30% to 48% and only 25% of graduates exit high school collegeready, compared to 40% countywide (Rampart GRYD Assessment, 2008). The College Bus will address the four primary causes of low levels of collegereadiness and enrollment in Bresee's area: 1) a public education system that does not provide adequate preparation for postsecondary education; 2) limited exposure to college; 3) underperforming schools; 4) and low family educational attainment. First, it will partner with local public schools, which lack the resources to offer adequate preparation for postsecondary education, supplementing their curriculum with college prep. Second, it will systematically expose students to college by bringing all students on a college tour. Third, it will strategically partner with underperforming schools, maximizing the collective resources of the community. Finally, by providing an informed staff and intentional followup, students who are the first in their family to attend college will not navigate the application process on their own.</p>





<p>During the pilot year of the College Bus, all CCVHS students will participate in a College trip to a local college, including an overview of the school and its application requirements, meeting a current student, a discussion of cost and financial aid, and a video of Bresee alumni sharing about their college experiences. This model will ensure that every CCVHS student is informed about key topics and has visited a private college, two junior colleges, a UC, and two CalStates by graduation.</p>





<p>Though a college tour will create the desire for youth to attend college, it alone will not ensure that students are collegeready. Following the college trip, Bresee will partner with test prep expert Tutor Ted to offer comprehensive college prep for all students:</p>

<p>Bresee's regular youth programs will also be available to CCVHS students, including tutoring, paid internships, athletics, arts, and family  services. College Bus participants will be eligible for Bresee's needsbased college scholarship, which has awarded 100 students with almost $500,000 in the last decade.</p>





<p>After successfully implementing this pilot program at CCVHS, the  model may be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 central LA high schools in a threemile radius of Bresee. The model may also be adapted and replicated by other nonprofits, to systematically ensure that all 1,632,427 students attending public schools in LA are collegeready by 2050.</p>

<p>Bresee is proud of its many alumni who are living out its vision by serving the next generation. This success is exhibited by Cesar, who came to Bresee for a karate class and now has his own karate studio that offers its program at Bresee; by Pedro, who learned to make films in Bresee's media program and is now teaching film at a nonprofit; and by Roger, who was sent to Bresee by the probation department and recently served as assistant to assemblyman Mike Davis. <b>These young leaders acknowledge that Bresee was critical to their success.</b> Andy, a Bresee alumnus who now serves as a founding board member of MultiCultural Communities for Mobility, shares his story:


<blockquote>""My mom struggled to make ends meet. I had no sense of direction. I began using drugs and stealing to find happiness. I got caught and was referred to Bresee, where my perspective on life changed. I took anger management classes and met weekly with my counselor Rene who helped me to look at life differently. Bresee gave me this sense of accomplishmentsomething I had never felt before. One day Rene told me about a job opening at Bresee. I took the job and began working with firsttime offenders, opening Bresee's first community service program. This was the first real job I had ever had. I worked parttime at Bresee, went to community college, and eventually transferred to UCLA. With the help of Bresee and their scholarship opportunity I graduated  something unimaginable during my younger days. Without Bresee's financial and emotional help I never would have gotten this far.""</blockquote></p>","<p>Bresee will continue its twoyear partnership with CCVHS, a charter school one block away. In 2012, CCVHS' graduation rate was 83%. Only 38% of graduates went to a 4year college and 52% completed the AG Requirements. With one college counselor, CCVHS is not equipped to provide college prep for all students. Given CCVHS' record of academic gains, the College Bus is the ideal intervention to help CCVHS progress towards its goal of 75% of students going to college.</p>





<p>Bresee will also partner with Tutor Ted to provide test preparation. Bresee will continue working with College Access Foundation, which contributes to Bresee's scholarship fund, provides program support, and connects Bresee with training and networking.</p>","<p>The ultimate goal of the College Bus program is to intentionally prepare a full student body for college. This includes providing <b>annual college trips to high schoolers using gradespecific curriculum and measuring improvement on gradespecific standards during the 20132014 school year (including AG requirements, PSAT/SAT prep, CAHSEE prep, personal statements, FAFSA, and scholarships).</b> Bresee's College Coordinator will work collaboratively with Tutor Ted and CCVHS' College Counselor to collect, maintain, and analyze the evaluation data supporting the following outcomes quarterly:</p>





<p>100% of CCVHS Students (450) will:</p>


<ul>


<li>Visit a college campus on the College Bus, as measured by a pre and posttest.</li>


<li>Set the goal of going to college, as measured by vision setting sheets, completed during the college tour.</li>


<li>Receive a tour of the Bresee Foundation and an overview of its Youth Programs while on their college tour, as measured by attendance.</li>


</ul>





<p>95% of 9th grade participants will:</p>


<ul>


<li>Develop an AG Completion plan to share with their counselor and parents will gain an understanding of college requirements, as measured by AG Completion plans.</li>


</ul>





<p>95% of 10th grade participants will:</p>


<ul>


<li>Improve on a PSAT practice test, collected by Tutor Ted.</li>


</ul>





<p>95% of 11th grade participants will:</p>


<ul>


<li>Increase their scores on PSAT and SAT practice tests, collected by Tutor Ted.</li>


<li>Demonstrate improvement on a CAHSEE practice test (if they haven't already passed the CAHSEE), as measured by pre and posttests collected by teachers conducting remedial tutoring.</li>


<li>Receive individualized feedback on their personal statement, as measured by attendance at personal statement workshops.</li>


</ul>





<p>95% of 12th grade participants will:</p>


<ul>


<li>Increase their scores on a SAT practice test, collected by Tutor Ted.</li>


<li>Complete or receive individualized assistance completing their FAFSA, as measured by attendance at FAFSA bootcamps.</li>


<li>Submit or receive individualized assistance completing a scholarship application, as measured by attendance at scholarship bootcamps.</li>


<li>Be eligible for the College Bus scholarship, as measured by College Bus program attendance and scholarship applications.</li>


</ul>





<p>In addition to the outcomes based evaluation recorded above, students attendance at all of the workshops and tours will be tracked and analyzed to ensure that students take advantage of the full College Bus curriculum. While shortterm successes can be seen through the numerical goals described above, <b>the true mark of success will be that more students graduating from CCVHS will enroll in postsecondary education.</b> This data will be monitored and tracked by CCVHS' College Counselor. Additionally, success of the College Bus program on a whole will be demonstrated by replication of the program at other local schools.</p>","<p>The College Bus will benefit LA by systematically ensuring that the <b>most academically atrisk students are exposed to college, collegeready, and ultimately collegebound.</b> This will immediately include exposing a full student body of 450 to college and providing followup that results in AG requirement completion; improved CAHSEE, PSAT, and SAT scores; and more collegeready students applying to college and enrolling with the necessary financial aid and scholarships. By piloting a scalable model, the impact of Bresee's College Bus will not only be felt in our corner of the city, but eventually across LA. After successfully implementing this program at CCVHS, the model may be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 high schools (with almost 11,000 students total) in a threemile radius of Bresee. This would allow us to progress towards a day when all of the high school students in the Rampart area have been exposed to college and are collegeready. <b>The model may also be adapted and replicated by other nonprofits, to methodically ensure that all 1,632,427 students attending public schools in LA are collegeready.</b></p>





<p>The majority of people that Bresee serves live in an area called the Rampart Gang Reduction Youth Development (GRYD) Zone. This is the most densely populated area in LA, with an estimated 75,000 residents, the highest concentration of recent immigrants in LA and 805 active gang members, responsible for nearly onequarter of the city's gangrelated crimes (Advancement Project, 2008). It is estimated that 90% or more of the students Bresee serves are at the low to very lowincome level. The area has an unemployment rate of 11% (Urban Institute), compared to 6% countywide (2010 Census). The majority of the students that Bresee serves attend schools in the bottom 10% of schools statewide, with the lowest graduation rates in the city (California Department of Education, 2013), and only 25% of graduates complete necessary college prep coursework (Rampart GRYD Assessment, 2008). In 2012, 100% of Bresee's scholarship recipients were the first in their family to go to college.</p>





<p>By targeting the most atrisk youth with college prep and exposure services, the College Bus will create a culture of collegereadiness in partner schools, resulting in a wave of students like Laura, an undocumented student who was hesitant about college due to finances. She got college prep through Bresee, earned a Bresee scholarship, and is now attending CalState, Dominguez Hills. Laura states, ""Without Bresee, I wouldn't be where I am today."" Or a wave of students like Mario, who attributes the 100point increase in his SAT score, which landed him in his dream school (University of Oregon), to Bresee's SAT class. When the College Bus program is replicated across the city, not only will there be more Laura's and Mario's, but there will be longterm implications on the economic and social climate of the city at large (see below).</p>","<p>In 2050, we envision a fleet of College Buses steering LA's most academically atrisk youth from areas such as South Central, Compton, Watts, and East LA to college. The program would have <b>spread throughout LA</b> and be on the road to becoming a national best practice in college prep.  The College Bus program would have raised a <b>large scholarship endowment</b>, to continue providing needsbased scholarships to students in LA.  Reputable local colleges and universities would partner formally with the College Bus program, committing to enroll lowincome students from underperforming schools in their programs.</p>





<p>By creating systematic change for full high schools, <b>the economic and social fabrics of the communities served by the College Bus will reap longterm rewards.</b> Having overcome barriers to higher education, College Bus alumni will become adults who have:</p>


<ul>


<li>A lower likelihood of unemployment; workers with their bachelor's degree are more than half as likely to be unemployed (The Atlantic, 2013). </li>


<li>Access to a broader job market; Nearly 60% of jobs require higher education (American Public Media, 2013). </li>


<li>A better chance of increasing their income quintile; A college degree gives lowincome children a 75% higher chance of doing so (US Department of Education, 2012).</li>


<li>A variety of social benefits, including being more likely to volunteer, vote, exercise, and have health insurance and pension (New York Times, 2010).</li>


</ul>





<p>Students who overcome the limitations imposed by their neighborhood, educational, economic or family circumstances and go to college exemplify the vision of the College Bus program. This vision has been lived out by generations of Bresee alumni, including Bresee's current College Coordinator, Chheav Em:</p>


<blockquote>""I first heard about Bresee's college trip from my high school tennis coach [at Belmont High School.] She learned about the trip and suggested that I go. My parents always emphasized the importance of education. Although I didn't know a whole lot about college, I always planned on going. On the trip, I learned that college is all about independence and freedom. The trip showed me that there was a world out there that I knew nothing about and I was excited to be a part of it. One of the biggest impacts of this trip was the exposure to a small liberal arts university in Idaho, a school I never would've considered attending but ended up going to. I looked at it as an opportunity to experience something new. I got my degree in social work so that I could learn more about how to serve the youth and their families.""</blockquote></p>





<p>The same College Bus that shaped Chheav's future will now shape the lives of hundreds of youth in her neighborhood and the city at large. <b>The ultimate goal is that in 2050, all students in LA public schools will overcome barriers to higher education and graduate from high school collegeready and collegebound.</b></p>"
3102203,2013203,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Recess.html,Creating a Positive Learning Environment, Education,"Playworks exists because, for many lowincome children, recess is not a fun experience. Recess is where bullying happens, fights break out, and student become too upset to absorb lessons taught in the classroom. A 2009 nationwide Gallup Poll of 2,000 elementary school principals revealed that 89 percent of disciplinerelated problems occur during recess and lunch. (â€œGallup Survey of Principals on School Recessâ€, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2010.) Principals block out time every day to deal with discipline problems from recess, and teachers deal with the aftermath. Additionally, many lowincome children live in areas where safety is a concern. They often come from neighborhoods challenged by poverty and crime with limited opportunities to engage in healthy play with their peers. As a result, these children come to school not knowing how to appropriately engage with peers which contributes to a playground experience riddled with conflict. Students who return to class angry, frustrated and scared cannot learn. 


However, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes in its 2012 policy statement The Crucial Role of Recess in School, that â€œRecess serves as a necessary break from the rigors of concentrated, academic challenges in the classroom.  Equally important is the fact that safe and wellsupervised recess offers cognitive, social, emotional, and physical benefits that may not be fully appreciated when a decision is made to diminish it. The American Academy of Pediatrics believes that recess is a crucial and necessary component of a childâ€™s development and, as such, it should not be withheld for punitive or academic reasons.â€ (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/1/183.full.pdf+html)


Playworks has a solution to the chaos on the playground that maximizes recess and uses play as a transformational tool for educators and children. We believe that building a highfunctioning, positive recess climate directly affects the creation of a positive school climate. A 2010 report entitled School Climate Brief from The Center for Social and Emotional Education, founded at Columbia University, states â€œResearch supports the notion that positive school climate promotes studentsâ€™ ability to learn. A positive school climate promotes cooperative learning, group cohesion, respect and mutual trust. These particular aspects have been shown to directly improve the learning environment.â€


Playworks places a highly trained program coordinator at each of our partner schools to run games and physical activity before, during and after school, teaching respect, inclusion, empathy and problemsolving through play. Playworks also trains student leaders, through the Junior Coach program, to resolve conflicts on the playground and beyond. Playworks gets all kids in the game, regardless of background, skill or physical ability. By using play, a universal activity accessible to every school child, Playworks creates a positive school climate where students know what is expected of them and their peers. As a result of this improved learning environment, students can do better in school. According to Playworksâ€™ yearend surveys of teachers and staff, our partner schools have seen an increase in class participation, teachers have been able to reclaim an average of 19 hours of teaching time that would have otherwise been lost dealing with student conflict and students have experienced a dramatic reduction in bullying and disciplinary incidents.











","In 2012, Playworks was selected as one of the Social Impact Exchange's 100 Index in the category of education. The S&I 100 Index consists of highimpact nonprofits that have been carefully vetted through a comprehensive selection process. More than 150 experts have participated in a crosssector collaborative effort to identify and assess the nonprofits that have been selected to be part of the Index.


In 2011, Forbes magazine selected Playworks Founder and CEO Jill Vialet as one of its Impact 30: a list of the worldâ€™s leading social entrepreneurs. The magazine defines â€œsocial entrepreneurâ€ as a person who uses business practices to solve social issues. The selection was made by a panel of blue ribbon experts, tasked with identifying â€œsocial entrepreneurs who are tackling the world's most intractable problems.â€


In 2008, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the nationâ€™s leading public health foundation, invested $18.7 million in Playworks because it believes that Playworksâ€™ program improves childrenâ€™s health. In 2012, RWJF invested an additional $8.5 million in Playworks to continue backing the growth of our program.


In 2013, Jill Vialet, CEO and Founder of Playworks, was awarded the James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award. The James Irvine Foundation Leadership Awards annually recognize Californians who are advancing innovative, effective solutions to critical state issues. Since 2006, awards have been given to 45 recipients, both individuals and groups, working in a wide variety of fields, including education, health, agriculture, economic development and the environment.


Playworks featured at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009. The mission of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) is to turn ideas into action. Established in 2005 by President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges.


","Playworksâ€™ primary partners are the Southern California elementary schools we serve. In our fourth year, Playworks SoCal currently provides our model physical activity and play program in 26 lowincome elementary schools serving approximately 15,000 children in the Los Angeles area daily. Our partner schools consist of: Firestone Academy, Gateway Academy, Huntington Park Elementary, Inskeep Academy, Junior Collegiate Academy, JuanitaTate Academy, Slauson Academy and Titan Academy in the ASPIRE network of charter schools; BennetKew Elementary, Highland Elementary, Kelso Elementary, Payne Elementary, and La Tijera Elementary in the Inglewood Unified School District; Aldama Elementary, CNCA â€“ Burlington Academy, Florence Griffith Joyner Elem","Playworks SoCalâ€™s program commitment to success is reflected in our indepth evaluation process and organizational fidelity to tested program components. Playworksâ€™ evaluation methods include: 


Annual surveys of principals, teachers and staff at Playworks partner schools to assess the effectiveness of our program. These surveys measure the impact of Playworks programming on student behavior during recess, in the classroom and overall. As a result of the feedback we receive, Playworks updates and improves our program components to better fit the needs of every partner school.


Recess Observation & Reflection: conducted throughout the year by the Playworks SoCal Program Directors, Program Managers, and Program Coordinators to help create program consistency across all schools; 


Junior Coach Assessment & Training: assessment conducted by Playworks Program Coordinators at the beginning and end of the Junior Coach Program with leadership training conducted throughout the year; 


Student Engagement Survey: conducted by teachers at the beginning and end of programming to measure changes in level of student engagement in a random group of students; and 


Program Quality Visits: conducted by Playworksâ€™ Director of Program Quality which allows Playworks to identify programmatic trends in order to adjust training, support or program components to ensure high quality programming from all cities.


Playworks has been proven effective in improving school climate by virtually eliminating bullying with a program based around inclusive play and vigorous physical activity. In 2012, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nationâ€™s leading public health foundation, contracted with Mathematica Policy Research and Stanford University to conduct a rigorous, randomized control evaluation of Playworks. The study found that as a result of Playworks teachers had more time for teaching, students behaved better both at recess and in class, and schools felt safer and experienced less bullying. Read the entire study through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundationâ€™s website. (http://bit.ly/R1uSN9)


","Playworks inclusive approach to play gets all kids active during recess and offers more opportunities for vigorous movement throughout the day. The link between physical activity and childrenâ€™s performance in school is becoming more and more clear. As reported by the New York Times in April, 2011, â€œ...the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a metareview of 50 studies and found â€˜substantial evidenceâ€™ that schoolbased physical activity â€˜can help improve academic achievement, including grades and standardized test scores.â€™ Educators need not worry about losing precious teaching time: the report found â€˜no evidence that time spent in recess had a negative association with cognitive skills, attitudes or academic behavior.â€™â€ A randomized controlled trial of Playworks found that children in Playworks schools spent more time at recess engaging in vigorous physical activity than children in control schools.


Every year, as one of our internal evaluation methods, Playworks conducts surveys of principals and teachers at our partner schools to help us learn more about the impact of our program. Survey results from our Southern California partner schools for the 20112012 school year showed that:


91 percent reported an increase in the level of participation in academic activities; 


89 percent reported an increase in studentsâ€™ abilities to focus on class activities; 


78 percent reported a decrease in the incidents of bullying during recess;


81 percent reported that the transition time from recess to classroom instruction decreased, which enabled teachers to reclaim at least 19 hours of teaching time over the course of the school year;


92 percent reported that Playworks had a positive effect on overall school climate.	


We expect similar or better results in the coming school years in Southern California.


Playworks positively impacts childrenâ€™s physical, cognitive and social development. Through our fivecomponent program (recess facilitation, inclass game time, the Junior Coach Program, before and/or afterschool programming, developmental sports leagues), Playworks transforms the playground into a place where students learn essential skills such as teamwork, conflict resolution, empathy, and fair play.


Educators and staff at our partner schools tell us that we have helped them create a safer, more inclusive school climate with student leaders who are able to engage respectfully with peers and adults and contribute to a positive learning environment. Playworks' ultimate goal is to create an educational environment where students learn how to interact with their peers in appropriate and respectful ways, practice safe and healthy behaviors, take on meaningful leadership roles, and become the focused learners their parents and teachers want them to be.


","With every school a Playworks school, children will be excited to attend school each day.  Teachers are free to teach and children to learn.  Without the fear of violence and exclusionary behavior at recess children engage in various games and activities.  Children learn teamwork and leadership skills that they use not only at recess but in the classroom and in the community.  Educational success will not be determined by your zip code as all schools will be safe, fun and rich with educational opportunities."
3102204,2013204,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/potlucktruck.html,Potluck Truck, Social Connectedness,"Loosely based on the ubiquity of food trucks in the landscape of Los Angeles, the Potluck Truck is a mobile unit that encourages community engagement through informal cultural activities and collective meals. Moving from neighborhood to neighborhood, the Potluck Truck is a temporary community center that offers discussion groups, film screenings, and workshops all related to food and food production in Los Angeles, as well as related topics that address ideas of growth and sustenance. By not limiting itself to one location, the truckspace will interact with multiple publics and connect people in different cultural and geographic locations in the city. Our indicator is social connectedness, and the Potluck Truck brings people together. The name reflects the idea that everyone brings something to the table, metaphorically or practically, whether that be a story, seeds, a soup, or their wonderful selves. When people come together, especially when there is food involved, there is encouragement to relax, and conversations happen. Project Food LA is excited to retrofit a food truck and transform the interior space into a seed and book library, a space for people to leave poems, recipes and photos as well; the truck becomes a reflection and archive of the diversity of Los Angeles. We would joyously partner with local farmers and create programming around seasonal produce. Farmers will be invited to present about their farming practices, water conservation methods, and showcase their produce. The truck will include a film screen and pull out benches and poofs  the ability to turn an empty lot into a makeshift outdoor theatre. Food connects people; we all have to eat and the Potluck Truck uses this simple fact as a platform to challenge the normalization of areas of the city being food deserts, and the potentially isolating nature of domestic space. It harkens back to the idea of the commons, a space where everyone has a right to be, and inscribes food democracy into that shared privilege to congregate, and act, as empowered citizenry.","When the City of Los Angeles passed a moratorium on new fast food restaurants in 2008, Project Food LA (PFLA) was formed to bring diverse, creative voices to issues of food and justice in Los Angeles. Since its founding, PFLA has staged a series of provocative events in diverse locations in the city.





Hungry Urbanism


In this panel discussion series taking place over 4 months, PFLA engaged diverse thinkers to help look at the food system as an urban planning/design issue. The series of four discussions were staged at locations including Habeas Lounge and Southern California Institute of Architecture, the MAK Center in West Hollywood, and the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Watts. The discussions tackled a range of topics including the role of local urban planning in the context of a global food system, a survey of urban food practices, the cultural conditions of health in South LA, and proposals for an urban farm in Watts.





Fragrant Flavor Freeze


Six local chefs were asked to create ice cream featuring a local, seasonal herb for a tasting event on Fatherâ€™s Day. Visitors were invited to sample, smell, touch, taste the herb and the ice cream on which it was based. The goal of the event was to celebrate flavor and local, seasonal ingredients. Participants were challenged to reconnect multiple senses to the experience of taste.





Sage Table


For an exhibition of creative family practices with Broodwork at Otis College of Art & Design, PFLA created the â€œSage Table.â€ This table was an apothecary of sorts, cataloguing 17 types of local sage in a unique table. The tabletop contained the sage varieties as well as a series of seeds for collection and home planting. Visitors were invited to sow the seeds with pots and organic soil that were provided. The table also housed a variety of reference materials and didactic information about the sage so common in California.





Micheltorena Tree Planting


With a grant from Closed on Mondays, PFLA was able to provide materials and labor for a tree planting at Micheltorena School in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles. As part of the schoolâ€™s community work day and the United States Green Building Councilâ€™s day of service, PFLA engaged a school mission to transform asphalt to permeable surface and fruit trees. A Guava Tree was planted in the playground, and has grown since we implemented the project.





Mudtown Farms


PFLA has been engaged with Mudtown Farm, an initiative of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. We have been involved with a series of events for this project. With a successful Prop 84 grant of nearly $5 million, PFLA has staged tours, cross promoted and advocated for the realization of this project.





In addition to these past events, the Potluck Truck is something we have discussed for quite a while. Currently, events are being planned around the conflict between indigenous Mexican farmers and the Monsanto Corporation as big agriculture attempts to take over the Mexican production of corn.

Future of Places International Conference (New Urban Agenda), Sweden (organized by the UN Habitat and Project for Public Spaces)  www.futureofplaces.com","Often times, success may be evaluated in numbers: one million ""likes,"" two million ""followers,"" three million ""repins."" As the events of the Potluck Truck may be rendered digitally in the forms of video, online blogging and publications, the Truck will eventually earn ""likes,"" ""followers"" and ""repins."" While significant in helping to prove and proliferate success, the levels of achievement of the Potluck Truck cannot be evaluated solely on these terms.





This project aims to provide a venue for mutual learning and discussion. The Potluck Truck lends itself to becoming a stage for a lecture series, a wall for murals, unfolds into a table for shared meals, and is a roaming vessel of art. It travels to where the people are, and allows community members to gather around a common table. In this rich environment, discussions will be had, ideas will sprout, relationships will be strengthened and plans for a better Los Angeles will be made. When the event ends and the Truck packs up, however, will that productive environment remain  internally or nurtured through connection? If so, some level of success may be claimed.





The Potluck Truck is an agitator, inciting activity and exciting new or an existing dialogue. While the event itself is brief, a successful eventâ€™s impact will not be short lived. On the contrary, it may inspire a group of young film makers to pursue filming a much need documentary, or motivate an individual to organize a compost program in his/her neighborhood. The results are, indeed, myriad and promising. ","Los Angeles is often referred to as a city without a center, a city of multiple cities. Within this vast metropolis, many neighborhoods lack adequate public green spaces to enjoy. Only 4% of Los Angeles is devoted to public greenery, compared to 17% in New York City. Additionally, the inequitable distribution of green space is staggering, and lower income neighborhoods suffer the cost in health challenges and increased violence. Studies prove these correlations time and again. This lack of shared public space affects the ability to build relationships in the city; there are remarkably few locations to claim or meet to eat a meal. Los Angeles needs a responsive public arena  the Potluck Truck! The Potluck Truck is a mobile public space where the diverse publics of Los Angeles may choose to engage with each other and their environment, simultaneously reflecting the neighborhoodâ€™s character and the way that nature is present in the city. Using nourishment as a catalyst for social engagement, the Potluck Truck reconnects us to the history of Los Angeles as a chaparral biome and its robust farming history.





Los Angeles was not always paved over; until the mid 1950s, LA County was the top producing agricultural county in the United States, surpassing the Midwest. Now only 6,000 acres are farmed in the county. Los Angeles grew as it did because of the fertile soil and year round growing season. The draw to the west came from the possibility of planting oneâ€™s desires into the landscape, turning the soil and using the land productively. Downtown Los Angeles was a patchwork of vineyards, Hollywood grew lima beans, Sylmar was the Olive Capital of the World, Watts was home for beef cattle. The Los Angeles Unified School District had required curriculum in agriculture, and specific land allocated for this use. 4H clubs thrived as youth learned farming techniques, and today, many fallow fields remain in middle schools. The Potluck Truck is a dedicated way to acknowledge, honor and gently reinscribe lost ways of knowing and being with the land, and the value of coming together around food. The Truck is a creative platform encouraging all to participate in a form of art that, implicitly, is the commons. The shared building of ideas, responsive to specific temporary environments, may themselves become more stable in space.





Los Angeles as a city suffers from vast divisions and cultural isolation, partly due to the lack of adequate public transportation and the massive area of the city. As an inclusive space, where all are invited to engage with the Potluck Truck, a shared community resource, the mode of exchange is dialogical, not based on economic currency. The Truck functions in a renewable way, constantly fueled by shifting community energy. This platform challenges cultural and economic alienation, and grows an archive of place and connection. Community members become stakeholders in the Potluck Truck, and are encouraged to create programming and events.","Success would be perceived and visible in people willingly and eagerly showing their empowerment through active participation in the commons. This would be demonstrated, initially, through an ownership of the Potluck Truck (PT). People could suggest ideas for events that serve their community and grow the PT's exhibitions, film screenings, and contribution to the seed bank, helping to initiate contact with both new publics and connect folks with similar interests. The PT reveals the contribution of all present, shifting the focus from the creators of PT to those gathering together.





Throughout history, food and meals have served as a foundation of community, exchange and societal ritual. The PT reasserts the sharing of meals and breaking of bread as an essential element in a healthy community. The PT is a mobile celebration around food. It is not dinner in front of a TV and it is not lunch in a car. This is a truck that delivers slow food events.





These social events would contribute to an ongoing process of making visible the public sphere, and allow the thematics present during PT to reflect upon a greater LA while helping to soften the current balkanization of the City. The inclusivity would support an embodied equity that would, ideally, extend beyond the PTâ€™s presence.





During PT events, people may explore and express a spirit of civic collaboration, seeing their neighbors and people across the City as allies, unique cuisines and community struggles  to varying degrees  shared by the whole. This would, over time, provide a means to emphasize our interconnection and mutuality.


Primary indicators of wellbeing, relationships strengthen resilience and ability to manage stress. Creating social settings for people to congregate that serve the need for recreation, education, culture and health will encourage the establishment of further permanent public gathering places that nurture social connection. Swiftly, the PT shows the importance of the public sphere and incentivize equitable allocation of gardens and parks in lower income neighborhoods. 


Consciously intending to braid publics, constituents, and local and municipal authorities, the PT chooses to transform and regenerate our built landscape through interventions that leave all involved nourished and considered. Playfulness within a serious willfulness to mobilize change is the methodology.





Running on biodiesel, advocating for local foods, hosting a seed library, showing that art is a right and not a privilege and welcoming all, the PT models an inclusive vision for cultural vitality and dialogical processes that encourage collaboration. PT will affirm oneâ€™s sense of importance and deservingness. It will be a platform to motivate and inspire discussions and partnerships that are generative and expand to contribute towards creating equitable distribution of green space, access to healthy foods, engaging cultural programming and livable neighborhoods.

3102205,2013205,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/inspirehealth.html,Inspiring Healthy Futures, Health,"<p>Most lowincome mothers seeking treatment for addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse face a heartbreaking choice: give up their children to a guardian or foster care and get help, or stay with their families and continue to suffer. Prototypes provides Los Angelesâ€™ most vulnerable women and children access to behavioral healthcare and social services to ensure they can become healthy, independent and productive community members. Prototypesâ€™ LA2050 project is to ensure the robustness and sustainability of our childrenâ€™s services.</p>





<p>Prototypesâ€™ childrenâ€™s services are critical to the motherâ€™s success and allow for Prototypes to tackle the intergenerational cycle of addiction, abuse and poverty. Children of addicted parents are the highest risk group to become alcohol and drug abusers, and studies have also shown that children with mothers with mental illness are at increased risk for psychological problems as well as alcohol and drug problems. Of the children who arrive at Prototypes, 56% of them suffer from developmental delays, hyperactivity or difficulties with attachment and 71% of them have witnessed violence in their home or community.</p> 





<p>Prototypes was founded to fill the gaps left by traditional social service organizations and has pioneered the way to treat complex issues including homelessness, cooccurring substance use and mental health conditions and trauma by allowing mothers to stay with their children through recovery â€“ and by providing a safe, comfortable environment for women and children to receive treatment for all of these issues in one location. A majority of clients have multiple physical and mental health needs, including chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Prototypesâ€™ programs reflect these multiple needs by including rehabilitative, educational and vocational services along with lifeskills training. In fact, Prototypesâ€™ programs were the first of their kind to offer wraparound services within a single location to ensure that women who complete the program are strong, selfsufficient and able to care for and support their children. Pregnant and postpartum women receive specialized support, treatment and access to pre and postnatal care, and children receive a vast array of services including individual and childrenâ€™s group therapy, onsite childcare and a Head Start preschool as well as pediatric care to ensure their best start at life. This holistic approach to treatment enables Prototypes to serve extremely highrisk women and children with equally high success rates.</p>





<p>One of the most highrisk populations that Prototypes serves is women within the criminal justice system. This work started with the addition of Prototypesâ€™ Community Prisoner Mother Program to provide residential substance abuse treatment services to CA State inmates. The Community Prisoner Mother Program, in partnership with the CA Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, is truly a unique residential treatment program and provides comprehensive treatment with the goal of preparing inmate mothers and children for successful reintegration into their community. Respecting their important roles as mothers, Prototypes assists in reuniting mothers with their children and preventing separation of mothers and their infants at birth.</p>





<p>As LA looks toward a healthier 2050, todayâ€™s children determine the future status of the health indicator. Integrating children into their motherâ€™s treatment, and providing these children with physical and mental health services, reduces their risk of future problems with substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal justice involvement and keeps them out of the child welfare system. Keeping mothers and children together also plays a significant role in helping women maintain a sense of hope and determination as they proceed through treatment. Notably, mothers who receive familycentered treatment have increased rates of posttreatment sobriety. Ultimately, supporting both mother and child together strengthens their bond and ends the intergenerational cycle of addiction, abuse and poverty.</p>





<p>Health is a critical component in determining a personsâ€™ overall living condition. Providing critical services to children as early as possible ensures a healthier outcome with reduced risks of physical, mental and emotional health problems, including chronic diseases. And, while Prototypesâ€™ childrenâ€™s services help improve the health of Los Angeles, they also impact other indicators including education, public safety and income and employment. Preventing future health risks and providing a child a safe home enables them to continue their education, which, in turn, reduces the chances of crimerelated activity and keeps them on the path of higher education and employment. While Prototypesâ€™ services aim to address the current health needs of uninsured and vulnerable women, these services also ensure future generationsâ€™ health and safety.","<p>When Prototypes first opened its Pomona Womenâ€™s Center in 1988, it was the first residential treatment center of its kind to allow women to keep their children with them while they recovered. Since then, Prototypes has rapidly grown to be one of the leading behavioral health care providers of comprehensive treatment for vulnerable families with cooccurring disorders. Prototypes is also one of the largest social service organizations in the United States serving highrisk women and their children. Highlights of Prototypesâ€™ past achievements include:</p>





<p>â€¢In 1989, Prototypes became one of the first agencies in the United States to offer AIDS prevention and outreach programs specifically targeted to women at risk. </p>





<p>â€¢Prototypes opened STAR House in 1999 as a transitional domestic violence shelter for women and their children that provides comprehensive treatment at a confidential location. </p>





<p>â€¢Through an innovative partnership with the LA County Criminal Courts, Probation, District Attorney, Public Defender and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Prototypes begins providing services for the Womenâ€™s Second Chance ReEntry Court program in 2007. </p>





<p>â€¢In 2011, Prototypes began accepting most PPO and HMO insurance plans and developed affordable payment options for those who do not qualify for Prototypesâ€™ governmentfunded programs. This allowed us to serve even more individuals while also preparing for healthcare reform.</p> 





<p>â€¢When Assembly Bill 109 became effective on October 1, 2011, Prototypes was notified that its Community Prisoner Mother Program would close. Through legislative action and advocacy, Prototypes was able to keep the program open after its scheduled close date on June 30, 2012. Today, Prototypes operates the only program in the State of California that allows mother to serve their sentence in residential treatment instead of prison. </p> 





<p>â€¢Given its history and success, Prototypes has led other social service organizations in strategic advocacy efforts. In October 2012, Prototypes conveyed its First Annual Think Tank, bringing together experts in the field of treatment for women and children. With rapid changes in health care, it is imperative that organizations have a unified voice that helps shape further legislative action. The discussion and understanding that arose from the Think Tank is currently being developed as a white paper to disseminate throughout the State. </p>","Prototypes maintains many partnerships throughout Los Angeles to provide comprehensive services and to reach highly vulnerable individuals. Partnerships with local and state agencies such as the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health and Department of Children and Family Services provide a foundational support for the organization. Prototypes also partners with the Pomona Unified School District to provide Head Start programs and academically enriched afterschool programs. Prototypes also collaborates with a federally qualified health clinic to ensure rapid access to primary and pediatric care of its clients, especially those with chronic health issues such as HIV/AIDS, whether or not they are insured.  ","<p>The success of Prototypesâ€™ programs is dependent on both the wellbeing of women and children and addresses four objectives. The most immediate is to decrease the use and/or abuse or prescription, alcohol and other harmful drugs. Additionally, Prototypes aims to increase selfsufficiency and parenting skills, improve mental and physical health and decrease recidivism and exposure to crime and violence. Prototypes success is dependent on the mothers being able to find a job, provide housing and a safe environment for their children. Shortterm outcomes include:  75% of clients will show increased job skills, 70% will find safe and stable housing and 90% will demonstrate an increase in effective parenting skills. </p>





<p>Specifically for children, this project will ensure that 100% of children will receive mental and physical health assessments and will receive treatment and/or referrals for treatment if needed. Additionally, Prototypesâ€™ infant and toddler daycare will provide developmental assessments to ensure young children are meeting appropriate stages. Longterm outcomes would impact the future of these children and include lower rates of chronic diseases and lower mortality and morbidity rates. Successful outcomes also include lower rates of substance abuse, mental illness and domestic violence as well as lower incarceration rates. </p>","Prototypes is often a last stop for women and their children who have immediate needs like access to shelter and food, but also complex mental health and substance use issues. With 11 locations in Los Angeles, and serving 12,000 people annually, Prototypes currently reaches underserved communities as a critical safety net for individuals seeking intensive and individualized treatment. Prototypes works to make sure that health disparities are reduced for the most underserved communities, increasing this populationâ€™s overall health and access to care. Additionally, Prototypes has made infrastructure changes in preparation for healthcare reform ensuring that our services continue to reach underserved care as individuals gain access to health insurance. Prototypesâ€™ unique social service model fills a much needed gap in care in Los Angeles and is directly benefiting children who may have not received services or who may have been sent to the child welfare system when their mothers entered residential treatment. Each day, Prototypes provides children with shelter, food, counseling and therapeutic daycare in a safe and nurturing environment alongside their mothers. The women receive intensive and integrated services that give the tools to care for and support their children, ensuring their health and that their opportunities for success are not denied.  This project works to remove health as a â€œhindrance to human developmentâ€ as we envision a better Los Angeles. ","<p>The children that Prototypes serves today will be between 40 and 50 years old in 2050 and, due to Prototypesâ€™ intervention, will enjoy better outcomes than their parents because their opportunities were not limited due to addiction, violence or mental illness. Rates of gainful employment and stable housing will be higher, and their overall quality of life will be greater. This group will also have significantly less problems with substance use, mental health and domestic violence, and, since they were able to stay with their mothers, they have continued to build strong bonds within their own family and community. They will also have reduced risk for chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes or cardiac disease due to their own knowledge and ability to seek preventive care. Therefore, their own children will have better health outcomes because of their access to preventive health care services and educational and career opportunities. </p>





<p>Today, many children at Prototypes have complex histories including experiencing extreme poverty and witnessing violence and abuse. Many children have severe behavioral problems, while others have reversed roles with their mothers, becoming her and their siblingsâ€™ caretaker. Yet, others display a lack of attachment or trust toward others due to past unstable living arrangements such as homelessness, having attended numerous schools in one year or being left unattended for long periods of time. This story of neglect and unequal access to basic needs should not be a part of Los Angelesâ€™ future. By treating these children and their mothers now, Prototypes greatly improves the health and wellness of many families in the future.</p> 





<p>Including children with their motherâ€™s recovery has the longest and greatest impact and works to make sure that LAâ€™s lowincome communities of color no longer paint a dismal health picture. Not only do women have higher rates of posttreatment sobriety, but the children receive critical services that keep them out of the child welfare system and prevent them from repeating the cycle of abuse, addiction and poverty.</p> "
3102206,2013206,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/PublicCounsel.html,Smart Growth for All: Affordable Housing Near Public Transit, Housing,"Imagine the Los Angeles of 2050. Will it still have trafficchoked freeways, everincreasing pollution, and neighborhoods divided by lines of wealth and poverty? Or will it have smogbusting transit and bike lanes, playgrounds and parks, and housing that everyone can afford? 





Public Counsel is using its legal muscle to help create a future for LA that is greener, more prosperous, and more livable. For the past few years, we have been focusing on ensuring that plans for the cityâ€™s public transit system include affordable housing, so that lowincome residents can benefit as public transit reshapes the regional landscape.





With an unprecedented influx in transit investment taking place in LA, the key question facing our communities is: how can development happen so that everyone benefits, and nobody is left behind? Transit corridor and transitoriented development (TOD) is an increasingly popular strategy to improve our built environment while reducing carbon emissions.





Thanks to the passage of three critical pieces of legislationâ€”Assembly Bill 32, Senate Bill 375, and LA County Measure Râ€”TOD is becoming a reality in LA. City planners estimate that 80% of new development in the city will be transitadjacent, and the Mayor has appointed a Transit Corridors Cabinet to plan for dense, walkable, mixeduse neighborhoods near transit.





But with transit development comes both opportunity and risk, especially for existing lowincome residents of transit areas. Mounting evidence shows that TOD can actually work against many of its stated goals, resulting in rising land value and housing costs, displacement of lowerincome residents by higherincome residents with higher rates of vehicle ownership, and thereforeâ€”paradoxicallyâ€”declining transit ridership.   





The need for affordable housing near transit is especially urgent in Los Angeles. LA is the most economically segregated metropolitan area in the country. Residents in the cityâ€™s existing station areas have median household incomes of less than $30,000 a year, significantly lower than the regional median. Nearly threequarters of station area residents are renters and more vulnerable to displacement.





Another reason for the urgency of equitable TOD in LA is the dissolution of Californiaâ€™s redevelopment agencies in 2012, which resulted in the loss of $64 million in annual economic development in LA alone. Public Counsel demonstrated the power of legal strategies to effect systemic change when it recently challenged the Stateâ€™s attempt to take redevelopment funds targeted for affordable housing in eastern LA County. At a hearing, the judge asked Public Counselâ€™s pro bono attorney how losing such funding would cause immediate harm. The attorney provided sworn declarations showing, for example, that without funding for affordable housing, many families will be on the street or forced to remain in transitional shelters for a year or longer. One mother of three described how her family is packed into a single room where they have trouble sleeping, the kitchen is too small to cook an adequate meal, her 5yearold daughter has to attend an unfamiliar school, and she lacks the permanent address she needs to find a job. At the end of the hearing, the judge granted a preliminary injunction protecting $38 million in affordable housing funds.





Against the backdrop of this crisis in redevelopment funding, TOD is being touted as â€œRedevelopment 2.0.â€ But TOD can only help redevelop lowincome neighborhoods to the benefit of existing residents if we put policies in place to make that happen, and ensure that those policies are effectively implemented.





Thatâ€™s where Public Counselâ€™s legal muscle comes in. Too often, resident and community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of their neighborhoods. Too often, plans are made but not implemented. We have used our legal expertise in the past to ensure an open and accessible public process, and we have worked with our nonprofit clients to develop innovative policies that advance the interests of local residents.





Building on our prior successes in South LA, the Cornfield Arroyo Seco specific plan area north of downtown, the 15 mile radius surrounding the City of Industry, and the southeast cities, Public Counsel will:





(1) Advocate for the development and preservation of affordable housing and antidisplacement policies near transit;





(2) Advance land use plans that represent the needs of vulnerable residents; and





(3) Provide indepth, oneonone legal and policy assistance to nonprofit affordable housing developers, and to communitybased organizations representing lowincome residents, to help them participate in community planning processes.





Working together, Public Counsel and our partners can ensure that transitoriented development works for lowincome communities, for the smart growth goals of the city, and for the environmental aspirations California shares with so many people throughout the world.","For the past two years, Public Counsel has worked with the Southeast Asian Community Alliance to develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the transitrich Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown. The campaign focused on obtaining incentives for increased affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.





Public Counsel won a preliminary injunction this year, preventing the State from taking $38 million in affordable housing funds from the LA County Housing Authority. Acting on behalf of the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing, we protected these funds that are designated for affordable housing for lowincome seniors, people who are homeless, families, and transitionage youth within 15 miles of the City of Industry, which includes many areas around transit.





Our staff attorneys led a team of lawyers in reaching an agreement, in 2011, with the developer of the Lorenzo project in South LA, in which the developer agreed to concessions worth $9.5 million. The Lorenzo project is the largest of its kind along the cityâ€™s planned Expo Line extension. The agreement delivered a wide range of community benefits, including 7,500 square feet, rent free, dedicated to communitybased health care services, and 5% of the units built to be made affordable to people who earn less than 50% of the area median income.





With Public Counselâ€™s leadership, the Alliance for Community TransitLos Angeles engaged in a strategic planning process; finalized its vision, mission, and principles; solidified its membership base of 20 diverse organizations; strengthened its infrastructure; and developed the key parameters of a citywide equitable TOD campaign.





Public Counsel represented the interests of lowincome tenants whose affordable housing was at risk of being lost in Los Angelesâ€™ rapidly gentrifying coastal zone, which already had a limited supply of affordable housing. In 2011, we reached a historic settlement with HUD and the owners of the Holiday Venice apartment complex that provides for 20 years of affordability provisions and protects current tenants from being displaced.  





We are engaged in a longterm campaign in the southeast cities (Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, and South Gate) to increase familiesâ€™ access to child care and green space through changes to those citiesâ€™ general plans and zoning codes.





Public Counsel is providing legal advocacy to preserve a 400bed homeless shelter that is at risk of being shut down or forced to relocate by the 710 freeway expansion.","The communitybased organizations we will work with include East LA Community Corporation, Southeast Asian Community Alliance, Little Tokyo Service Center, and SAJE. We will also work on TOD planning strategies with the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing.





In addition, Public Counsel is a founding member of the Alliance for Community TransitLos Angeles, a coalition of 20 groups working to ensure that all residents and workers in the city have a seat at the table as TOD plans are developed and implemented.





Finally, we partner with the California Affordable Housing Law Project, and with major law firms like Katten Muchin Rosenman that donate pro bono legal services to our efforts, in order to maximize our impact.","We expect to complete the following work plan for this project:





(1) Advocate for the production and preservation of affordable housing, along with antidisplacement policies, near transit in LA County.





(2) Mobilize at least 10 other organizations and coalitions to advocate for the production and preservation of affordable housing near transit in LA County.





(3) Provide indepth, oneonone TODrelated policy assistance to at least 5 communitybased organizations working in lowincome neighborhoods in LA County.





(4) Provide indepth, oneonone general (transactional) legal services to at least 20 nonprofit organizations working for affordable housing or shelter for people who are homeless or lowerincome, including in TOD.





Public Counsel uses a comprehensive case and data tracking programâ€”the ProLaw databaseâ€”to track a wide variety of quantifiable measures of effectiveness and efficiency.





In addition, after closing every legal matter, we ask our clients to evaluate our work. The best measure of our success will be that our clients, community partners, and residents will report a stronger voice in shaping the communities they live in and serve.





Finally, the TOD plans with which we are engaged will contain language advancing affordable housing and antidisplacement, and the legal matters we work on will result in increased or preserved funding for affordable housing.","Our project will use legal and policy tools to help lift up the voices of residents and community organizations engaged in planning for transitoriented development in Los Angeles. If the process of developing TOD plans meaningfully incorporates such voices, those plans will result in documented benefits of equitable TOD, including affordable housing for residents with low income around major transit stops; increased community access to jobs, healthcare, and fresh food; increased public transportation ridership; increased public investment and economic activity; and reduced traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and commuting times. Most of all, as Los Angeles develops its transit infrastructure, it will do so in a manner that allows it to retain its socioeconomic, racial, and cultural diversity, and that does not push out existing communities and residents.





A number of affordable housing advocates and communitybased organizations have sought our legal assistance in influencing local TOD planning processes and in advancing affordable housing and antidisplacement policies near transit in South and East LA. Particularly after our success in achieving innovative policies to advance affordable housing and economic development in the Cornfields Arroyo, there is great momentum to achieve similar innovations in other local plans and in citywide planning processes.


 


Specifically, through this project:





â€¢  Organizations working to advance affordable housing near transit will have legal tools and increased capacity to shape the development of their neighborhoods;





â€¢  The views of communitybased organizations serving lowincome people in Los Angeles will be represented in TOD planning processes; and





â€¢  Proposed California transit legislation will contain language that supports lowincome communities.","If we are successful in achieving our goals for equitable transitoriented development in 2050, Los Angeles will preserve its stock of quality housing that is affordable for lowincome residents, and will use the transit build out as an opportunity to build even more affordable housing. Public TOD planning processes will be transparent, and will include input from lowincome community advocates at all stages. Most importantly, no person will live on the streets or in substandard or overcrowded conditions due to a lack of affordable housing, and no one will be displaced as a result of transit development. Existing residents will benefit along with new residents from equitable TOD.





We envision healthy communities where residents are not segregated economically, where there is equal access to affordable housing located near jobs, and where schools, healthcare, groceries, and other essential services are within walking distance. And we envision a Los Angeles that is an environmental leader, with cleaner air and reduced carbon emissions."
3102207,2013207,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MARKETMAKEOVERS.html,Market Makeovers: NextGen Leaders, Health,"Public Matters is not after the quick fix. Weâ€™re in it for the long run. We believe a great idea will become an effective solution only if the community it seeks to help takes ownership of it. Market Makeovers: NextGen Leaders proposes to evolve young leaders from within their communities to drive longterm sustainable change in the places they live. Specifically, we are asking LA 2050 to fund a group of emerging adult community leaders (age 1824) to transform the food landscape, food behaviors and health outcomes in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, building on an existing infrastructure within which theyâ€™ve worked for the past three years. These NextGen Leaders are deeply committed to the work of improving the health outcomes of their community, having already invested some serious sweat equity, received extensive training in health, leadership, public speaking and media production, and transformed local stores. For them, itâ€™s personal; the work they do impacts the health of their families, friends and loved ones. LA 2050 funds would take their leadership development to the next level so that they have increased opportunities and greater capacity to bring about meaningful, sustainable community transformation.





Public Matters has been greening food deserts through Market Makeovers since 2007 â€“ one corner store at a time. We started in South L.A. with the Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative and for the past three years, have been doing Market Makeovers in East L.A. and Boyle Heights through Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, a project of UCLAUSC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities. In recent years, there have been numerous â€œcorner store conversionsâ€ (as theyâ€™re known in public health circles) to address the â€œgrocery gapâ€ in â€œfood deserts,â€ areas that have limited access to quality, healthy food; an overabundance of fast food; and high rates of chronic conditions related to poor diet. Typical corner store conversions involve some physical transformation of existing stores, the addition of healthier inventory (usually fresh fruits and vegetables), and some marketing of the new items. Shortly thereafter, the stores are left to their own devices. As an intervention strategy, Market Makeovers are another order of magnitude, aiming for community transformation. They encompass education; community engagement and relationship building; business training for storeowners/operators; store transformation; and social marketing to change health behaviors and increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Local youth and residents play a central role in the handson work of transforming markets, educating the community about the benefits of fruits and vegetables, and promoting the Market Makeover stores. They implement the solution, and in so doing take ownership of it. Market Makeovers are not just about supply; theyâ€™re also about creating demand. You have to make sure you have community buyin, that if you stock those fruits and vegetables, locals will buy (and eat) them, so that healthy food retail becomes viable.





Thatâ€™s where the NextGen Leaders come in; LA 2050 funds would enable them to pick up where conventional corner store conversions leave off, after the fanfare of the grand reopening dies down: to promote transformed MercadoFRESCO stores in East L.A. and Boyle Heights so that healthy food retail takes root, becomes the norm, and results in improved health outcomes. LA 2050 funds will provide NextGen Leaders with additional training and opportunities for leadership development so that they can work directly with Public Matters, Nathan Cheng Consulting, municipal and community partners to shape the project. NextGen Leaders will receive training in store operations, marketing, graphic design and visual literacy so they can assist the stores with retail presentation and merchandising, create instore graphics and displays and social marketing campaigns to promote healthy food behaviors. They will plan, promote and conduct community events: public presentations in schools and local organizations, cooking demos at the markets, and video screenings. They will access local leaders and participate in community meetings and decisionmaking processes. They will become the public faces of the project and lead East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights to a healthier 2050.


","Public Matters is a social enterprise that builds creative and social capital in communities. As a forprofit business, Public Matters designs and implements neighborhoodbased new media, education and civic engagement projects for social change. It cultivates crosssector partnerships between grassroots organizations, academic institutions, neighborhood residents, youth and local municipalities. It builds relationships and develops future leaders. We have a track record of innovative, impactful projects. Our project timelines favor deep, longterm engagement, with work measured in years not months. Our most important achievements are those we accomplish through our programs:





Market Makeovers, Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, UCLAUSC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) â€“ Funded by a fiveyear grant through the National Institutes of Health, we worked with Torres High School, Roosevelt High School, The Office of L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina (D1), Volunteers of East L.A., other local organizations, and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in East L.A.; two more are forthcoming in Boyle Heights.





Market Makeovers, Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative â€“ Funded by the California Endowment, we worked with The Accelerated School, The Office of L.A. Councilwoman Jan Perry (CD9), and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in South Los Angeles and created a mediarich online resource, www.marketmakeovers.org.





PDUB Productions â€“ We worked with Pilipino Workers Center, HyperCities, UCLA REMAP, The Office of L.A. Councilman Eric Garcetti (CD13), and local stakeholders to create an innovative youth media + civic engagement program through which local youth created digital content about Historic Filipinotown for distribution on multiple platforms: interactive Mobile Hi Fi Tours via mobile devices and a Pilipino Jeepney; and HyperCities, an online, mapbased timetravel application. 





Working with mostly lowincome students of color, we have a strong track record of creating emerging adult leaders. Defying the odds of low college admission rates for East L.A. students, our entire class at ELARA was accepted into a fouryear college. Past students have gone on to colleges and universities including Brown, NYU, Sarah Lawrence, UCLA, and UCBerkeley. We have helped place youth leaders in local nonprofit jobs. We currently have four Proyecto MercadoFRESCO young adult leaders who are implementing Market Makeovers, training high school students, conducting cooking demos and social marketing campaigns.   





Our work has received national and local recognition. Twice, weâ€™ve been awarded the MacArthur Foundationâ€™s Digital Media and Learning Award, as part of HyperCities and Out The Window. Our projects have been covered by NBC, CNN, BBC Latino, Associated Press, L.A. Times, KCET, Next American City, and MIT CoLab, among others and will be featured in a forthcoming Harvard University Press book about Digital Mapping.


","â€¢	NATHAN CHENG CONSULTING: Our partner on all market makeover projects since 2007, Nathan is the guru of the â€œcorner store conversionâ€ movement and a nationally recognized figure in food systems. He will mentor the NextGen Leaders in all storerelated activities.  


â€¢	UCLAUSC CENTER FOR POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (CPHHD). Experts in communityfocused public health, social marketing, and evaluation, CPPHD will assist in these areas.  


â€¢	THE EAST LA RENAISSANCE ACADEMY AT ESTEBAN TORRES HIGH SCHOOL and ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL: NextGen Leaders are project alumni from these schools. They will continue to engage students through work at the markets, workshops on healthy eating and nutrition and peer leadership. 


","Health indicators and behaviors will be evaluated by Public Matters, and independently by UCLAUSC CPHHD and Nathan Cheng Consulting. NextGen Leaders make daily visits to and reports about the Market Makeovers stores to Nathan Cheng. Among the items that they observe and report are: the condition of produce, temperature of produce cases, store appearance inside and outside, and promotions of monthly produce specials and other instore campaigns promoting healthy behaviors. Beyond reporting, these visits are vital to cultivating a healthy relationship with all stores and establish NextGen Leaders are invested helpers to the stores. Nathan is also responsible for the overall relationships with the stores and for business training, including tracking inventory and sales of healthy and nonhealthy items. We also use targeted promotional activities like frequent buyer cards for produce, coupons and store flyers that are easily tracked. CPHHD tracks the quantity, quality and level of nutrition education of the cooking demos.





CPHHD independently evaluates the overall success of the market makeovers strategy as part of its research about improving cardiovascular health in East LA and Boyle Heights. They conduct extensive longitudinal surveys and field research with residents, store patrons and participants in project activities. 





Public Matters is responsible for evaluating the impact and development of social marketing activities and of the NextGen Leaders. Social marketing is measured in different ways that include the reach, placement and impact of campaigns.  Activities vary from onetime events like a presentation to a school or community group to the placement of NextGenled social marketing campaigns in bus shelter posters. Surveys conducted by NextGen leaders gauge the impact of these activities. Other indicators include the number of local partners and municipal agencies that take part in a given campaign, the number of agencies and businesses that will post collateral materials and tiein store promotions to social marketing campaigns. These indicators of community investment are linked to the success of the project stores. 





Leadership development and education of the NextGen Leaders is monitored in several ways. Prior to hiring the NextGen Leaders, Public Matters takes track of their skills in communication, computing, design, and leadership. Skill development in these areas is not only part of their continued training, but is evaluated at the mid and end point of their involvement in the program. We believe leadership development is about both skills development and about access. So, we also monitor how NextGen Leaders spend their time, how their social networks grow, what community members, leaders and organizations they meet and work with, how their selfconfidence and selfesteem grow, and their ability to effectively implement programmatic activities. We hold weekly and monthly checkins with all NextGen Leaders. 


","East L.A. and Boyle Heights, like many underresourced neighborhoods, have had their fair share of solutions presented to them by experts, usually from outside their communities. Some of them get implemented. Of those, few are implemented long enough and with adequate resources to take root, to become part of the fabric of the community it serves such that members of that community claim it as their own. The issues around the East LA + Boyle Heights food landscape and poor health outcomes among its predominantly Latino residents are serious and unhealthy food behaviors deeply entrenched. According to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, its population suffers high rates of obesityrelated chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. It has some of the highest rates of childhood obesity (32.2%) in the county. The situation will not change overnight. Because NextGen Leaders are from the community, their fellow community members are more likely to listen to what they have to say. Their actions on behalf of their neighborhoods carry greater weight. They can lead from within, in a way outsiders canâ€™t. Support for Market Makeovers: NextGen Leaders is a longterm investment in the future health of East L.A. and Boyle Heights, a model of homegrown leadership development that could be applied all over Los Angeles.





Market Makeovers increase access to healthy foods and broaden awareness and education about healthy eating and behaviors; its engaged community participation results in greater buyin and a better chance at sustainability. Extending these efforts through the NextGen Leaders will result in a cadre of trained, engaged and experienced young leaders who are deeply rooted in community change and who have worked extensively on projects prior to their 24th birthday. NextGen Leaders have skills in: media production; public speaking and presentations; visual communication; teaching and peer leadership; healthy eating and nutrition; media literacy; and social marketing that are invaluable in many fields. And they are placed in an infrastructure that nurtures their development and allows them to directly effect change, whether in their immediate community or throughout L.A. 





The NextGen Leadersâ€™ age group falls inbetween many philanthropic efforts and services, whether or not they are enrolled in higher education. Their needs are acute. Having worked with teens for over twenty years, we often see youth hit an economic and opportunity ceiling once they graduate high school or reach age 18. Even in college, they are isolated from their communities rather than placed into learning and service opportunities in their neighborhoods, where they can deepen their roots and connections. Scholarship programs often donâ€™t come close to covering the true cost of higher education. Vocational programs tend to train professions, not creative leaders. Through Market Makeovers, we can change this and the food landscape together. 


","By 2050, the NextGen Leaders will have started a healthy chain reaction that ripples far beyond the health indicator. Within the health indicator though, the term â€œfood desertâ€ will be thing of the past. The words, deeds and creative social marketing and community engagement tactics of the NextGen Leaders will have inspired many a healthy eater. Quality fruits and vegetables will be commonplace in corner stores and in larger markets. Competition amongst stores, widespread social marketing campaigns about healthy behaviors, and pressure from both residents and local government, in addition to additional Market Makeover projects, will contribute to this change. Communities will be judged by plethora of healthy items and healthy community activities that exist in an area, rather than by the paucity of them. As a result, there will be significantly lower rates of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Communities served by the NextGen Leaders will have spread throughout Los Angeles, leading to a broader awareness of proper dietary habits and, just as importantly, access to healthy products. 





The original crew of NextGen Leaders will have moved into many disciplines and positions, from academia where there currently is a dearth of Latinos in fields like public health, nutrition and media, to local government, to leading their own communitybased projects and organizations. Others will be running Public Matters. Many will still maintain strong ties to their communities and will be regarded by the 2050 crew of NextGen Leaders as the â€œO.G.â€ community leaders. Strong role models and a highly visible and creative force in their communities, the influence of the NextGen Leaders will have sparked many others to follow in their path. Local government and agencies will have a demonstrated track record of the benefits of civic engagement projects led by emerging adults, leading them to develop their own means to engage young adults in substantive community work. High schools will feed youth leaders into these programs and work closely with these agencies. 





The NextGen Leaders will be at the forefront of a movement of emerging adult creative, engaged citizens and problem solvers that spring from diverse communities and backgrounds. All will share a deep commitment to their communities. Their impact will be felt in policy, education, health, social connectedness, income and employment, arts and cultural vitality and the overall social fabric of Los Angeles.

3102208,2013208,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/collegecapacity.html,Increasing Capacity for College Going, Education,"Our primary goal is to increase college attendance throughout the underserved communities of Los Angeles which will have a major impact on improving education in Los Angeles and the state of California.  There are thousands of students that attend schools in Los Angeles that are not getting the information they need to help them with the college going process.  They have the grades and have taken the required courses but are overwhelmed and confused about the college application process so choose not to attend college or go directly to a community college instead of a fouryear institution. Attending a community college is not a bad option but may take students at least 34 years to transfer to a fouryear college if they ultimately want to receive a Bachelorâ€™s degree. The programs that we offer target first generation, lowincome, collegebound seniors from lowperforming high schools and assist them with the collegegoing process. The I AM( Increasing Access via Mentoring) program is a mentoring program that provides assistance with the college choice, college admissions and financial aid processes. The SummerTIME (Tools, Information, Motivation, and Education) program teaches advanced writing and â€œCollege Knowledgeâ€ (e.g. time management, notetaking, financial literacy) to support participating students' transition to the freshman year.  Finally, Collegeology includes games (Application Crunch and Mission: Admission) that teach strategies for navigating the college application process in fun and interactive ways. The first game is a card game, the second is a Facebook Application. In April, weâ€™ll be launching FutureBound, a game targeting middle school students that illustrates the connection between making good decisions in middle school and college/career. We are currently working on a game that fosters financial literacy and knowledge about financial aid options for college.  Hereâ€™s the challenge: with I AM and SummerTIME, we are limited by resources as to how many students we can serve. With the online games, we need to train teachers and practitioners on how to use the games. The 2050 grant would help us expand the capacity of these programs.  We currently work with 11 high schools and serve approximately 300 students but we would like to expand our collegegoing model so that we can serve a wider student population in Los Angeles.  Our programs contain tools that can be replicated on a larger scale so that more students will have the opportunity to be accepted to college and receive a college education.  A My LA2050 grant would enable us to train more mentors, implement guidance activities at more schools, expand services offered and ensure college opportunity for a larger number of students.","The Pullias Center for Higher Education is dedicated to improving access to college for lowincome and historically underrepresented students. The academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students, families and schools define and address challenges related to college going and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes. Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the country.  Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a threepronged outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the Centerâ€™s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed â€“ I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide where to go.  Weâ€™ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting the program in 2005.  The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education) program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to fouryear colleges/universities to USC for a monthlong intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills.   The third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We decided to meet students where they choose to spend afterschool hours â€“ in cyberspace! We partnered with USCâ€™s Game Innovation Lab and students from Foshay Learning Center to create a series of roleplaying games about college and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the gamebased tools.","High schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District: Belmont, Crenshaw, Dorsey, Foshay Learning Center, Fremont, Manual Arts, Marshall, Roosevelt, Roybal Learning Center

","With regards to the effects of the programs on students outcomes, we will measure success by administering surveys to students prior to and post participation in our programs. The surveys will be designed to collect data on the effects of the program on college knowledge and collegegoing efficacy. We also will conduct selected focus groups with students and practitioners in order to gain a deeper  understanding of which practices are working best for students and their teachers and/or counselors.


We will also evaluate the project by analyzing the numbers of game players and if/how those numbers increase, thus increasing traction in the project. We will also analyze backend server data related to the games in order to ascertain the effects of game play on students' college aspirations and/or plans.","Our project will help improve the collegegoing rates at high schools that have the lowest collegegoing rates within the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Many students who are eligible for college choose not to attend college because they receive little support on how to navigate the collegegoing process or lack the information on how to apply.  By pairing mentors with high school seniors who are collegeeligible, they can successfully guide them through the college application process.   The high school graduation rate in California ranks in the bottom half of all U.S. states, with the Los Angeles Unified School Districtâ€™s own graduation rate well below the stateâ€™s, according to the U.S. Department of Education.  Budget cuts have severely affected the amount of college counselors at the schools. A shortage of counselors limits the support that students receive regarding the college application process. Traditionally, California students' access to counselors varies by grade level, and 29 percent of California school districts have no counseling programs at all. The ratio of students per counselor in California averages 945 to 1, compared to the national average of 477 to 1, ranking California last in the nation.  In Los Angeles, the average ratio is 800 students to 1 guidance counselor. Many underresourced schools have guidance counselors, but not dedicated college counselors. Students attending private schools and public schools in affluent parts of the city are afforded very different access to college information and support, often supplemented by parents employing private college counselors to shepherd their children through the complexity of college applications. Thus the gap between those who have access to resources and those who donâ€™t remains stark; the implications for college graduation rates and lifetime earning potential are obvious.  By having volunteers serve as mentors, they can alleviate the burden of college counselors having to work with enormous case loads and students can have the one on one interaction needed to understand how to navigate the college admissions and financial aid processes.","Currently California ranks 40th among the states in the rate of high school graduates going directly to college.  By 2050, we hope to increase collegegoing rates by 1520% by working directly with students who are eligible to attend college but lack the information and guidance to do so.  Young adults who delay college attendance also delay the economic and social benefits of higher education, benefits that accrue both to the individuals and to the state which contributes to our economy. In addition, research on college completion shows that students who follow the traditional college enrollment pattern of entering college immediately following high school are more likely to graduate from college.  Californiaâ€™s population is expected to grow from 37 million to approximately 60 million by 2050.  Since our population will dramatically increase by 2050, it is imperative that we have a collegeeducated population that will contribute to our economy.  We understand that it may not be realistic for every student to receive a college degree but itâ€™s important that they are pointed in a direction that offers as many opportunities as possible and that they learn invaluable skills that are required for longterm and sustainable employment.  We would like to expand our programs so that we can serve at least 1,0002,000 students during the academic year."
3102209,2013209,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/QualityOfLifeCenter.html,Improve The Quality of Life Through Education and Community Support, Education,"The Quality of Life Center, Inc., a charitable, community based nonprofit agency, was established in 2004. The specific purpose of the agency is to institute programs that will educate urban communities on the availability of assistance to lowincome, at risk youth and families residing in the Altadena, Pasadena and surrounding areas. The Quality of Life Center, Inc.'s mission is to develop and manage centers with multicultural programs and services designed to ensure that opportunities for success are equally shared by all participants with a desire to improve their quality of life. Through Art and Education we reach out to our youth and our communities.





Quality of Life Center, Inc. programs mark a bold departure from traditional guidance programming. Through innovative instruction and individualized attention, youth travel a road to success that begins with believing in themselves and never giving up on the fact that success is yours for the taking. Though our programs somewhat defy the norm, they are now ""nationally acclaimed"" and have proven to be extremely successful in meeting the needs and providing youth an opportunity to prove to themselves that honesty and hard work can and will bring about positive life changes.





Many of our youth programs address: youth who are dropping out of school, depressed, some with no sense of self worth, and others turning to the ""streets"" for love and understanding. Some are trapped in situations in which they have had no chance to follow their dream. ""If we don't help them, who will?





Our nationally esteemed Bright Futures Scholars program participants are brilliant scholars with extremely high GPA&'s. Quality of Life Center programs are designed to assist the young, enabling them to become productive citizens, build self esteem, dream and then conquer their most ""impossible"" dream.





Without programs such as the ones offered in the Quality of Life Center, Inc., one out of every three lowincome minority students attending high school will dropout before earning a diploma (2005 PUSD Statistic). Most will not be encouraged to return to school, nor offered pretraining to become marketable in corporate America. Many students, even young scholars, if coming from lowincome families will not have an opportunity to reach their full potential and scores of juvenile first offenders will be placed in the justice system.





Much of our programming depends on community support. We are proud to say that our programs are endorsed by community leaders who see the value in what is being accomplished to direct positive changes in the future of our communities. The National Education Association (NEA), as well as many surrounding school districts, plan to foster pilot programs using Quality of Life Center Inc. components in 2008.





At the Quality of Life Center, we have an opportunity to service families with many different needs. We will strive not only to meet the needs but to eliminate the problems causing the need.





The Quality of Life Center will continue to make every effort to assist the youth, young adults and families in low income atrisk communities by providing services that improve the quality of life for all.","We currently have a 100% success rate in graduates from our Bright Futures Scholars Leadership Development program. They have ALL graduated from high school and moved on to college. Many of these students come from group home or foster home environments. Many of these same students are also the first ones to attend college from their families.





One of our other programs is a second chance program that allows juvenile first offenders an opportunity to turn their lives around. These Juveniles, referred into the program from the Juvenile Justice System are given an opportunity to redeem themselves, build selfesteem, and develop character while learning to make positive life choices. Many have taken that opportunity that they were given and done just that. Most of them have gone on to college and are living a life ""on the straight and narrow"".","Community leaders such as the senator, congressmen and congresswomen, assembly members, county supervisor, ,mayor, council members, corporate executives, doctors, lawyers, judges, local schools superintendents, law enforcement and others, willingly volunteer their time to mentor our scholars individually as well as in groups.","Our success will be evaluated and measured by the high school and college graduation rates of our program participants. We maintain contact with all of our participants long past their graduation from this program and high school. We regular check up on our graduates to check on their college progress and success, including graduation from college as well.





It will also be measured by the continued growth of this program and ultimately the reduction of the high school dropout rates in this community through our Stars for Stripes program and the increase in graduation rates of juveniles who go through this program.","OUR PROGRAMS





BRIGHT FUTURES SCHOLARS LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM





The Program extends itself to all targeted high achieving (3.0 GPA) students, including lowincome students completing high school against insurmountable odds. The goal is to provide these young people with the tools necessary to quest for success.





A vital component in this program provides ""group mentoring"" as well as ""individual mentoring""from our communities finest. Committed mentors include congressman, senators, assembly members, mayors, county supervisors, physicians, clergy, corporate CEO's, attorneys, scientists, engineers, artists, educators, law enforcement officials, managers and administrators.





Bright Futures Scholars participate as Junior Council Persons (representing their mentors and schools all over the nation). Monthly Scholars television tapings are aired on Public Access Television, and can also be viewed online all around the world.





ï»¿HEALTHY, WEALTHY & WISE





A multicultural health program geared to youth (of all ages) and families. The program further extends itself to addressing health issues and concerns of atrisk and lowincome youth and families. Health education, at all levels, is provided to assist in maintaining healthy living and positive life choices.





SMOOTHING THE ROUGH EDGES ""UNVEILING THE JEWELS WITHIN""





A pretraining, prescreening program designed to target individuals' ages 1425 that need assistance in polishing &nbsp;employment,, personal adjustment, professional and marketability skills. Participants are prepared to be competitive in corporate America.





STARS FOR STRIKES





A second chance program that allows juvenile first offenders an opportunity to turn their lives around. Juveniles, referred into the program from the Juvenile Justice System are given an opportunity to redeem themselves, build selfesteem, and develop character while learning to make positive life choices.





ï»¿ART FROM THE HEART





A program in which children are able to express them selves through their passions in art be in visual arts or audible. Through painting, photography, or other visual arts or through the audible art of playing an instrument the children learn to release their emotions in a safe and productive format.","In the year 2050 success would be represented by many things: 1. Our Bright Futures Scholars Leadership Development Program curriculum will be in every middle and high school in the nation. These school will see an increase in the graduation rates of at least 15%.  2. Graduates of these programs will not only be successful in their personal lives but have a desire to give back and improve their communities stemming back to their volunteering while being a part of the Quality of Life Center, Inc. Their desire is to improve the quality of life of others.   3. Our mentors will still consist of community leaders such as senators, congressmen and women, assembly members, county supervisors, mayors, council members, corporate executives, doctors, lawyers, judges, local schools superintendents, law enforcement and others, but now those faces will be the faces of graduates of BFS who are themselves giving back to others what was given to them in their teenage years, which will make their messages and experiences even more poignant because they truly did come from where the current year 2050 students are coming from."
3102210,2013210,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CasaAmador.html,Casa Amador, Housing,"Reach For The Top, Inc., (R4TT) is a humanitarian nonprofit organization, our goal is to â€œProvide Hope through Housingâ€. R4TT, has been serving the community since 2005 providing the basic human needs of food, shelter, and clothing. In our day to day operations we have encountered many homeless single mothers with their children. Casa Amador will assist mothers and their children by creating a space where they can thrive and gain the skill set necessary to become successful, independent, and permanently housed. 





Casa Amador is a 27 bed apartment building for formerly homeless women and their children. The architectural style combines elements of early twentieth century mixed use design with current technology. The building is three stories tall on a corner facing Adams Boulevard, and two stories with a privacy screen facing the single family dwellings on Palm Grove Avenue in the rear. It is designed to provide an open, light filled environment for families preparing for the future. The units feature an open living room plan with kitchen and either two or three bedrooms and bath. There is a secluded interior courtyard. There is a laundry room, private meeting room and outdoor childrenâ€™s play area. At the street level are offices, parking and a commercial space. The building and systems are designed to the latest CalGreen and stormwater mitigation and pollution prevention standards. Solar panels and green roof are designed for the roof top.





Relationships are built and developed with individuals by creating familiarity through repeated interactions using our food distribution program that is done every Friday thus creating a climate where information can be provided about our program and other social services. 





By successfully rehabilitating, training, and assisting homeless women and children in the Los Angeles, R4TT would be providing our impoverished community with the tools to become selfsufficient and permanently housed.


","Currently R4TT has one lot with three households. On average we work with 30 individuals per month. This our biggest achievement. Every time one of our residents moves into stable permanent housing we have accomplished our goal.  Successful reintegration into society is our top priority. 





","For this project we will be working with the Emergency Housing and Assistance Program Capital Development and the Community Development Block Grant Program. Both have contributed money, and brought us to the beginning of construction.





We are also involved in food delivery to multiple groups who provide food to those that need it. We work with the Midnight Mission and the Mildred Cursh Foundation for food distribution. We also work with World Visions who provides supplies needed to support our facilities. We will continue to maintain our positive relationships with these groups.


",The plan is to produce a quarterly or biannual report on the programs effectiveness using a spreadsheet software to statistically plot our success rate and number of homeless that have become selfsufficient. Future data collected will include measurements of outcome such as the percentage of residents who are sober at discharge or who have become involved in local addiction recovery programs as well the percentage who become employed and/or establish permanent housing.,"The mission of Reach for the Top, Inc., is to address the plight of homeless and provide the support necessary for them to attain the highest level of independence and selfsufficiency to become to become permanently housed. Reach for the Top, Inc., provides transitional housing where clients can stabilize in a safe, nurturing, environment while receiving the assistance necessary to access the services that lead to permanent housing. Our goal is to send healthy, selfconfident, competent persons back into society. 





This program will help reduce the tax money used to care for the chronically homeless. Our residents will no loner be in jails, Emergency Rooms, or shelter. They will be in their new home, stable, safe and supported. We will assist them in finding permanent housing.





The proposed location of Casa Amador, 4801 West Adams was involved in the civil unrest of 1992. Almost 84% of commercial structures and 83% of residential structures were in need of repair, according to a California Redevelopment Association survey done in 1995. By developing this lot, it will aesthetically change the characteristics of this blighted area, encourage outside investment and provide much needed services to a neglected community.  





Providing stable transitional housing for the chronically homeless population that will also offer resources so residents can learn new skills, find employment, and finally find permanent housing will benefit the area greatly. These individuals will be supported so that they can succeed. Their success will bring hope to the neighborhood and elevate the entire area. 





This project specifically deals with women and children. For the children living at our facility they  will have a better start to their day; providing them with the foundation to succeed in school and life. this will set them on  the track to grow into conscientious citizens. 





Lastly our community center will be open to all individuals looking to participate or learn something new. This center will provide a place for people who might be on the edge of poverty. We would provide help to those who need it, keeping the potential homeless in their homes. ","Our new facility will be a prototype of successful environmentally sustainable, affordable housing. Hopefully by this time there will be facilities even move advanced and comfortable than ours, that are providing a safe place for homeless. They will be stewards of environmentalism and innovative ways of alleviating homelessness.  The residents of the facilities and previous residents will be thriving citizens, impacting our society in positive ways. 





More importantly, the children who came with their mother's to our facility will be grown adults, potentially with children of there own. With the life skills and support provided by us they will be able to successful in their adult lives. They will be socially and environmentally aware helping other as they, themselves were helped. Our future is these children and with our facility it should be a bright one.

3102211,2013211,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/RADARLA2013.html,RADAR L.A. International Theater Festival; A vital investment in L.A.Theater Artists,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"The RADAR L.A. Festival of Contemporary Theater brings some of the worlds most influential theater companies to downtown L.A., and invests in the future vitality of L.A.â€™s performing arts community with a unique residency program that creates infrastructure for L.A. ensembles to create their best work and put it in the global spotlight.





REDCAT and CalArts, with a consortium of public and private partners, will contribute to the cultural vitality of L.A.â€™s evolving downtown, and create crucial infrastructure for local performing artists to create new work, with a twopart proposal:





 To produce RADAR L.A. 2013, a major international festival of contemporary theater that activates varied downtown L.A. locations with adventurous performances by influential artists from L.A., Latin America, and the Pacific Rim, September 23 to October 6, 2013, and





 To organize a series of extended artist residencies and related public events that expands the neighborhood impact of the festivalâ€™s artistic initiatives and allows diverse artists to create new contemporary performances, while also increasing their vital role in the planning process for revitalization of downtown L.A..





The festival and residency programs build on momentum from the inaugural 2011 RADAR L.A., which featured 90 performances of 15 productions, engaging over 200 artists. Over 11,000 diverse patrons wandered between ten locations, experiencing affordable theatrical presentations, sitespecific events, social gatherings and symposia. The L.A. Times said the â€œrevitalizingâ€ festival fulfilled a â€œvision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexusâ€¦a resounding success.â€





By expanding RADAR L.A. with increased artist commissions and residencies, artists receive a strategic investment that addresses the L.A. 2050 reportâ€™s call for policies that nurture the L.A. arts community so it can thrive.





The experienced curatorial teamâ€™s provocative program includes:





Innovative artists who stretch the boundaries of traditional theater;





Communitybased projects exploring urgent social justice issues that engage the voices of often overlooked residents;





Cultural influences that reflect L.A.â€™s demographics, presenting artists from Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Japan, and Indonesia;





Interdisciplinary collaborations merging dance, theater, music and new media.





The L.A. Times captured the essence of the first festivalâ€™s vibrancy, calling it â€œan invaluable addition to the cityâ€™s cultural ecology,â€ and stressing its impact on the neighborhood: â€œBecause L.A.â€™s geography is so sprawling, that sense of urban density is hard to achieve. This is why a festival such as RADAR L.A.â€¦situated within an easily commutable area, can be so revitalizingâ€¦I scurried from one theater to the next, bumping into acquaintances old and new along the wayâ€¦â€.





The strategy behind the RADAR L.A. Festival is both local and global, recognizing that helping to create work is only one part of the solutionâ€”the plan must also include engaging the larger national/international field so that the impact is greatly enhanced, leading to vastly increased opportunities for artists and a significant shift in the perception of Los Angeles as a vital center for contemporary theater and dance.  This strategy is proven and effective: as a result of the 2011 RADAR L.A. Festival, six of the eight L.A. productions toured as a result of the exposure.","REDCAT is currently celebrating ten years of bringing experimental and interdisciplinary performing and visual art to Los Angeles audiences. Each year REDCAT collaborates with local, national and international artists and organizations on the presentation of more than 200 events, ranging from concerts to lectures, to dance festivals and film series. Collaborating directly with a wide range of artists and ensembles in the creation and presentation of their work and in the design of REDCAT programming means REDCAT is a part of the ongoing conversation about the changing dynamic of the local and global arts fields, and is uniquely positioned to influence and also respond to changing needs and opportunities. REDCAT engages a young, multiethnic, multilingual, and economically diverse audience, welcoming more than 60,000 audience members annually to concerts, dance performances, theatrical productions and exhibitions.","A consortium of REDCAT and CalArts, Center Theatre Group, the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, The Public Theater (New York), the Los Angeles Stage Alliance, the Los Angeles Theater Center/Latino Theater Company, and Theater Communications Group is engaged in the planning for RADAR L.A.2013. These respected organizations have joined forces to provide greater voice and visibility to contemporary theater from Los Angeles and around the world with artists who are creating works that resist easy definitions, using dance, media and techniques from performance art, sport, and film.


","Impact will be gauged not only by critical and audience response, but also by the extent to which RADAR L.A. successfully meets its objectives regarding the number of works to be supported and premiered, the cocommissioning relationships to be developed, and the audiences reached through performances and activities, including new audiences reached through the activation of public spaces. Results will be assessed via additional interviews with partners, audience surveys and evaluative sessions with community partners.


An online survey was distributed to all RADAR L.A. Symposium attendees after the 2011 Festival, and followup conversations among organizers, artists and the producing consortium have taken place in both informal and structured settings, leading to program adjustments and clarifications. In addition, 2011 Festival surveys and conversations indicate significant change in the perceived vitality, quality and influence of L.A. performing artists by the field.


The quality of the work is also measured by critical response from critics attending the festival, which The L.A. Times described as ""a glorious convergence of contemporary performance"" and ""a resounding success"" that demonstrated ""a vision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexus"".","The RADAR L.A. Festival and the related programs to support L.A. performing artists will benefit Los Angeles in many ways. In addition to creating an exciting international cultural event for audiences, it also addresses two important civic issues:





The unique festival and residency programming will contribute to larger, longterm strategies to utilize cultural activity as a key way to help revitalize transitional downtown neighborhoods that have been adversely affected by difficult economic conditions. Most public and private strategies for improving the quality of life downtown focus on capital construction and physical infrastructure, while the consortiumâ€™s proposal provides a burst of relatively immediate programmatic activity, serving as a possible model for how future cultural facilities currently in the planning stage might best be utilized.


The artistcentric programs are designed to help address the crucial need for performing artists to be supported in the creation of new work with infrastructure support, financial commissions, and exposure to national/international presenters and producers. The L.A. performing arts community has been severely underresourced compared to other major cities, and the perceived vitality of the arts community suffers as a result. Increasing artistic capacity and enhancing the quality of the work created by L.A. artists is as essential as investing in cultural facilities, yet limited funding has stifled the creation of any comprehensive civic strategies to address that issue.








By giving diverse artists the resources and exposure they need, they become better equipped to participate in the transformation of a community. As the L.A. 2050 Report cites, there is a need for artists to be nurtured so that they can thrive.


While the actual RADAR festival events are serving audiences and artists in many ways, it is the strategic investment in the artists themselves that produces the most enduring results for the artistic ecology of the neighborhood and the region.


The consortium addresses challenges that hinder L.A. performing artists:


L.A performing artists are underrepresented in the international performing arts touring field, limiting their ability to thrive.


Limited funding and infrastructure to create work and showcase it to leaders in the field, has kept L. A. artists underrecognized, with limited opportunities to tour or compete for national commissions vital to their careers.


Many playwrights, directors and choreographers believe they must leave L.A. to have a career. The vitality and reputation of the regionâ€™s artistic ecology suffers as a result.


RADAR L.A. helps by commissioning diverse artists and featuring their work alongside international productions, for an audience that includes visiting producers, presenters and funders, and the international symposium prominently features L.A. artists. The success of the 2011 festival demonstrates the potential longterm positive impact that reducing thes","The Los Angeles performing arts community can become more vibrant and have greater international influence if artists are given more opportunities to create work and gain exposure nationally and internationally. The L.A. 2050 Report cites a need to retain artists and nurture them so that they can contribute more fully to the cultural ecology.


Having a dedicated festival that at its mission supports the local arts community and brings artists together with presenters, producers and creative colleagues is absolutely fundamental to developing our cityâ€™s arts and cultural vitality. Artists need encouragement, space and critical feedback to develop confident artistic identities.  RADAR L.A. presents increased opportunities for cultural participationâ€“for both local artists and audiences.  A strong, wellrespected performing arts festival will serve Los Angelesâ€™ artistic and cultural vitality on many levels and has a spillover effect that enhances the quality of life for our greater community.

Imagine an entire generation of young Angelenos who grow up molding, repurposing, and upcycling discarded material bound for the landfill?  Thomas Edison said, â€œTo invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.â€ The Upcycle Innovation project will provide the â€œjunkâ€ and the tools needed for creative exploration and invention. Thomas Edison also said, â€œJust because something doesnâ€™t do what you planned it to do doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s useless.â€  By procuring â€œjunkâ€ for reuse the Upcycle Innovation project makes it easy and affordable to experiment and failâ€¦. and try again.





An award of $100,000 will provide key seed funding for the development of an exciting full service facility, dedicated to providing yearround tinkering, handson, arts projects for children, families, teachers and artists. Our project increases the opportunity for cultural participation through engaging artistic activities and fosters support for increased cultural participation.  By turning an abundant local resource â€“ trash â€“ in creative material we make it affordable.


","Using everyday discards donated by local businesses reDiscoverâ€™s range of handson, educational programs and workshops has served 24,500 people. We are proud of our Arts Earth Partnership certification and our 2007 Sustainable Quality Award from the City of Santa Monica. We strive to maintain a low carbon footprint and our current warehouselike facility for reusable waste helps our local businesses and households to do the same.


Our artistic caliber has been recognized by the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the Santa Monica GLOW Festival (2008 and 2013), the San Jose Zero1 Festival, the Long Beach Arts Council A LOT Initiative and Ryman Arts with a Drawing Inspiration Award.





We are also very proud of the inspiration our center provides to children. As 9 year old Beatriz said during a field trip, â€œI could live at this place!â€ 


","We are currently working with the UCLA Social Enterprise Academy on the business plan for this project. This plan will be completed this May. 





Within the nonprofit sector we have had success collaborating with other organizations. The Skirball Center, PS Arts, Otis School of Art and Design and the UCLA Lab School are current organizations utilizing our materials and teacher training services. The Upcycle Innovate project will expand our ability to work with them.





ReDiscover was founded by a small group of parents and professional designers. Their expertise will be an asset in the design and fabrication of the Upcyle Innovate workshop.   


","Creative reuse, such as the Upcycle Innovation project, provides a triple bottom line for the city by benefiting its people, the environment and the economy. We will measure the project through these three criteria. 





People: Our goal will be to serve 8,500 people (doubling the number served last year) in the first year through our various programs. We will also work with our network of educators to refine and evaluate our programs to serve a wide range of learning styles and ages. 





Environment and Economy: There are many ways of measuring the positive environmental and economic impact reuse has on our city. These include, but are not limited, to:


â€¢	# of tons diverted from the landfill


â€¢	$ avoided disposal costs (donor/seller)


â€¢	$ avoided purchase costs (recipient/buyer)


â€¢	$ value of materials donated (donor)


â€¢	$ revenues earned (donor/seller)


â€¢	# of job created or retained


â€¢	# of families/individuals/organizations assisted





We will work with Arts Earth Partnership and the Reuse Alliance to create an appropriately scaled evaluation tool.


","In 2013 our project will benefit Angelenos by providing a full service center for handon arts. Our goal is to open the project in the Fall and serve 700 people a month. Additionally, we will save an anticipated 3 tons of reusable materials from the landfill. As the project grows in the coming years these numbers will grow. 





ReDiscover Center programs benefit the youth of Los Angeles by providing artbased instruction at a time when school funding cuts have all but eliminated arts education. The programs are designed to promote collaboration, community stewardship, and critical thinking skills. Our Upcycle Innovation project will expand these programs. 





The Los Angeles Almanac projects by 2050 the population of our city will be 11,434,565. The impact of such a population boom on the volume of waste without dedicated space and resources to curb behavior cannot currently be measured. By creating a space dedicated to engagement through fullscale arts and tinkering programs, and triangulation with community organizations and leaders, we can realistically reach our goal of an entire generation of Angelenos growing up with the not just the understanding the concept of repurposing, but actually having taken an active part in the process.


","In 2050 Los Angeles will still be a global leader in the arts and design fields due to its strong arts education infrastructure. Every child and their various learning styles, will have an outlet for their creativity providing more opportunities for their career and for a vibrant, connected life. The reDiscover Center will be successful when it can support these goals."
3102213,2013213,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/RFKLA.html,RFKLA (Legacy in Action) Digital Archive, Education,"To create and manage a studentcentric online multimedia library, social media forum and digital media hub focused on social justice themes: The RFKLA Archive. The Archive is designed to help make the concepts of human rights and civil rights personally relevant to students, thereby inspiring them to become agents for change and engaged members of the Los Angeles Community.  





The Archive is the central project of RFKLA (Legacy in Action), a 501(c)(3) inspired by the democratic vision of Robert F. Kennedy.  As a model for 21st century participatory learning, the mission of RFKLA is to foster a more just society by educating young people to use evolving media technologies for positive social change. 





The RFKLA Archive is a collaborative effort with the students and teachers of the New Open World Academy High School (NOW). NOW is located on the Los Angeles School Districtâ€™s RFK Community Schools campus in midtown Los Angeles. It is being developed as a rich media repository of the works of social justice leaders past, present and future, as well as a social networking site and portfolio platform for studentsâ€™ social justicethemed works. 





The RFKLA Archive will provide teachers with comprehensive, interdisciplinary student centered lesson plans with a democratic pedagogical emphasis linked to the U.S. Common Core Standards. Students will produce and publish fieldrelated products, projects and artifacts, including investigative essays, documentaries and multimedia demonstrations that connect knowledge acquired in school with field research and community outreach activities. 





By offering a learning management system cocreated by teachers and students, on which information can be easily shared and constructed, combined with a robust data aggregator, the RFKLA Archive Project will help transform the way in which teachers teach and students learn. The Archive is intended to not only enhance all aspects of studentsâ€™ academic careers, but to benefit the greater community by expanding studentsâ€™ media literacy skills to discover their individual voices, to explore the world more fully from a social justice perspective and to contribute real value to their society.


","During it's first year and a half, RFKLA conducted three major projects:





â€¢    The Participatory Learning and You Program (PLAY!) was a joint program between RFKLA and the USC Annenberg Schoolâ€™s Innovation Lab.  Under the supervision of RFKLAâ€™s lead academic partner, Henry Jenkins, Provostâ€™s Professor of Communication, Journalism, Cinematic Arts and Education, LAUSD teachers and students, as well as invited nonprofit organizations, provided a year long training and research program on the application of 21st century new media literacies in the classroom. 


â€¢    Partnering with USC Annenberg, RFKLA provided after school programs with community outreach nonprofits, including among others: KCETâ€™s Departures Program; Laughter for a Change; and Animaction.


â€¢    Conducted an international educational game program: a semesterlong, synchronous game played between the 5th grade math class at RFK Community Schoolsâ€™ Ambassador School of Global Leadership and a 5th grade math class in Seoul Korea. The program was led by Professor Jong H., Wi, internationally recognized â€œserious gameâ€ designer and visiting Professor at CRESST UCLA school of education. 


","â€¢  Dr. Chuck Flores, Principal of the New Open World Academy (K   thru 12) at the Robert 	F. Kennedy Community Schools


â€¢  Themistocles Sparangis, Ed.D., Chief Technology Director, Educational Technology, 


â€¢  Dr. Lynne Goldfarb, Professor USC's Rossier School of Education.


â€¢  Mike Reich, President Seabourne Consulting (providers of information management tools and expertise)


â€¢  The JFK Library


","RFKLA plans to conduct a longitudinal research study with its USC Partners, collecting qualitative data regarding each developmental stage of the project.  


 


Success will be determined by a series of empirical measurements to be designed to evaluate individual studentâ€™s performances, as well as determine how well the overall program is performing. 





Teachers will also be regularly surveyed to determine how well the Project supports their work, specifically in integrating social justice and civil rights themes across content areas aligned to the Common Core Standards. 





Teachers will also be periodically queried on how effective the project is in providing lesson plans in which alternative forms of assessments are utilized to encourage student creativity and student voice.





RFKLA, with its partner Seabourne Consulting will use sophisticated Web analytics to measure and analyze the data collected by the Archives in order to optimize usage.


","1. The RFKLA Archive Project will amplify 21st Century learning opportunities for students throughout the LAUSD





2. Through a social justice lens, the Archive will promote connectivity between students and with the larger Los Angeles community by: 





â€¢    Using the social networking component of the RFKLA Archive to engage young people in dialogues throughout the LAUSD


â€¢    Introducing students to diverse and multicultural perspectives, thereby creating a more cohesive community of learners


â€¢    Promoting a shared vision of social responsibility across the LAUSD student community


â€¢    Chronicling the lives and stories of Los Angeles residents, for distribution on the RFKLA Archive site


â€¢    Serving as a hub for conversations with the Los Angeles community and beyond, the archives will become a â€œprestigeâ€ project to enhance Los Angelesâ€™ reputation as a city of 21st Century educational excellence 


","By 2050 the RFKLA Archive technology platform and learning management system will be freely available to any interested school system or educational institution.  The Archive platform will be the standard mechanism through which students create materials demonstrating capabilities learned in school. As a universally accepted learning tool based on a rigorously validated set of technologies, the RFKLA Archiveâ€™s learning technology will have a worldwide impact by advancing studentsâ€™ understanding of and capability to use technology, while also quantitatively improving learning and performance by increasing interest and engagement. 





By 2050, the RFKLA Archive will be seamlessly integrated across all subject areas throughout the LAUSD schools. Students attending LAUSD schools will be fully media literate and adept at producing media rich content for a global audience. Having gained diverse perspectives through their work, RFKLA Archive contributors will become role models for others. The alumni of the RFKLA Archive Program will become civicminded leaders in Los Angeles and engaged world citizens.

This park and accessway in Elysian Valley will serve as a precedent for future parks on the 51 miles of river banks, a continuous blank space that is almost as large as New Yorkâ€™s Central Park. The project seeks to address immediate open space shortages and create a platform where the citizens of Los Angeles can develop a relationship with their river and deepen their involvement in the eventual largescale modification of the river channel. <p>





A standard film permit will enable us to install River Landing for a weekend, and we will make a movie about the event to spur community and political support for future, public installations during all the summers until the river banks are permanently improved. River Landing will use a temporary scaffolding system and innovative designs to turn the bank into an accessible and multipurpose space without threatening the integrity of the channel. Because this intervention is only currently possible as a film shoot, we will cast the local community, river stakeholders, and other interested citizens to be in our film about inhabiting the river in this new and visionary way. <p> 





Inspired by Parking Day LA, which transforms parking spaces into semipermanent Parklets, we believe that this project will lay the groundwork for the city and river adjacent neighborhoods to advocate and execute summerlong riverbank parklets all along the Los Angeles River. By building and filming our River Landing we will demonstrate the value and feasibility of these installations. Furthermore, the project introduces a format by which Angelenos will become instrumental in reinventing their river, while also beginning to enjoy it now.* We believe that the L.A. River has the potential to rival the beach and mountains as the premier accessible openspace in L.A. but it needs our voices, vision, and support to help it realize its full potential! What better way than to actually inhabit the river with communitygenerated designs! <p>





*This summer, due to a city pilot program, a portion of the River Channel will actually be legally accessible! However, under the current public trust doctrine agreement you can only enter the channel through limited access points and there will be no amenities. <p>

Furthermore, we have discussed this idea with members of the community, multiple open space and river managing entities, and other stakeholders and received universally positive feedback. We expect our team to keep growing!","The primary measure of success will be whether we can generate enough support and interest to enable a publicly accessible River Landing next summer and for years to come.  We would also gauge the success of the project by the amount of interest and dialogue that it spurs in terms of thinking about how communities effectively engage with the redesign of the river channel now and in the future. <p>





Furthermore, we would measure the success of the actual design interventions with useroccupancy surveys conducted by the same folks who are organizing them for the Spring Streek Parklets www.parkletstudies.carbonmade.com. They will conduct surveys during the actual installation and do studies of users along the existing channel prior to our installation. ","By creating a prototype for temporary summer parks on the banks of the L.A. River, River Landing will become a precedent for the entire 51 miles of the river, thus potentially alleviating immediate openspace shortages throughout the city and county. Furthermore, by creating a format by which Angelenos can reinvent how they inhabit the river, future River Landings will both galvanize public support for permanent modifications and allow us to collectively build a new vision of the river through actual use. The river will be the landmark open space improvement in Los Angeles for this century â€“ this project both helps this happen and ensures we know exactly the kind of space we all want and need.

3102215,2013215,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/thebigdrawla.html,The Big Draw LA,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Our idea is to build on our Big Draw LA campaign, which entails organizing a monthlong series of inclusive, highly participatory public drawing experiences across Los Angeles at traditional and nontraditional venues. Through the month of October, we create and promote community drawing events at a diverse pool of venues such as museums, libraries, senior centers, restaurants, bars, parks, science centers, retail stores, or any other establishments that can help us get the public drawing! The Big Draw LA initiative, which we are presenting for the fourth year, will build community, entice nonprofessionals to make art, and encourage the public to value drawing as a tool for their own creative expression. When Ryman Arts first launched The Big Draw LA in 2010, it was an experiment. Based on our experience, we now see that this initiative has deepened our involvement with the larger community and broadened our own programâ€™s students' experience, thus strengthening our core program while at the same time cultivating the wellbeing and quality of life for our fellow Los Angelenos. 





The BDLA also includes our organizationâ€™s flagship event, â€œMake Your Mark in the Parkâ€ where both our students and alumni encourage and engage the public to make art. A funfilled, creative afternoon, we celebrate the act of drawing by welcoming thousands of Angelenos to draw together on paper rolled out along the length of an iconic Los Angeles park. After, the drawing is photographed and showcased as a scrolling panorama online. Last yearâ€™s event was held at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles where thousands captured the spirit of Grand Park and downtown Los Angeles. Students from our Ryman Arts program were on site to provide the public with art supplies and encouragement.





The Big Draw LA ensures that we can continue to educate young artists on the value of community engagement, build awareness of the value of art making, and increase opportunities for artistic participation among the greater Los Angeles public. All of these lead to an increase in public participation, and appreciation of both formal and informal arts events, and impact on Los Angelesâ€™ role as a leader in the arts. We hope to reach as many Los Angelenos as possible at our proposed BDLA events, allowing a broader mix of the public to engage directly with making art in their specific LA communities.  Funding will allow us to try more unusual venues, work with smaller community organizations that need more support to develop their BDLA events, and develop new tools to link events with online componentsâ€”ultimately, increasing access to the project. 


","Having spearheaded The Big Draw LA since inception in Los Angeles in 2010 and participated in the international Big Draw Conference in London in 2009, Ryman Arts is excited to be in its fourth year presenting The Big Draw LA with the support of a twoyear grant from the James Irvine Foundation. Ryman Arts executive director Diane Brigham and our staff have a strong commitment to the philosophical underpinnings of the initiative and gained unparalleled experience in both producing large scale public drawing events in complex collaborations, and coordinating the efforts of numerous and varied groups who produce their own BDLA events. Our organization has engaged over 65 organizations in The Big Draw LA, leading to over a hundred public drawing events. Approximately 8,000 members of the community have participated in The Big Draw LA flagship events, â€œMake Your Mark in the Parkâ€. The success of The Big Draw LA initiative mirrors the success of its presenter, Ryman Arts. 





Recently named a National Program of Excellence by the Presidentâ€™s Committee on the Arts & Humanities, Ryman Arts harnesses the talent and promise of Southern California youth who would otherwise not have access to advanced art education to help these teens reach their high potential. Ryman Arts believes that through the arts, youth can learn essential skills for both creative expression and life. Ryman Arts fosters studentsâ€™ artistic development and personal confidence, and provides the knowledge and resources they need to pursue higher education and careers in the arts. Ryman Arts offers free intensive studio classes taught by master teaching artists, college and career planning, field trips, support services, and community engagement opportunitiesall free of charge. Beginning with a single drawing class for 12 students in 1990, Ryman Arts has grown to 30 classes for 450 students annually, engaged 4,500+ Southern California teens in its core program, and provided outreach activities to 7,500+ inner city students. Classes are held on Sundays at the studios of Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles, and as of January 2013, we have expanded to offer classes on Saturdays at a second location on the campus of California State University, Fullerton in Orange County.





At our recent College Day, 23 universities and art schools met with students and reviewed portfolios of their work. The Spring Career program includes a panel for students and their parents, a â€œPackaging Yourselfâ€ workshop, and behind the scenes tours at studios including Disney and DreamWorks Animation. Since 2005, the annual Ryman Arts student exhibition and graduation has been held at the California AfricanAmerican Museum. We ensure broad access to the program with specialized outreach to underserved, lowincome neighborhoods, including workshops at Title 1 high schools. There were over 225 applications for the Spring 2013 semesterâ€”the highest number of applications in years.


","Over 65 organizations have partnered with The Big Draw LA in previous years ranging from LA public libraries to schools to shops. Additionally, we collaborate with numerous institutions (e.g. Active Arts at the Music Center), parks (e.g. Exposition Park and Grand Park), museums (e.g. The Huntington Library, The Getty, Craft and Folk Art Museum) and additional nontraditional facilities to expand the programâ€™s reach to the widest geographic and broadest demographic possible. Over the past two years we have formed an informal advisory group made up of individuals who have demonstrated particular expertise and leadership in conceptualizing Big Draw LA activities. It is through these collaborations that weâ€™ve been able to expand our reach.","We will evaluate The Big Draw LA based on our objectives and expected outcomes. Our objectives are to encourage varied community organizations to organize events, and coordinate the overall presentation and marketing of at least 100 audience participatory drawing events designed especially for nonprofessional artists for the The Big Draw LA (BDLA) month of October; produce 1 ""flagship"" BDLA community artmaking event in October reaching at least 3,000 people; support the development of engaging informal drawing activities that will involve the public actively in artmaking by providing at least 40 planning events in advance that are geared to nonarts organizations and/or nontraditional arts venues; and foster the interaction of community artists with nonprofessional participants.





We expect outcomes such as increased participation in direct drawing experiences by at least 14,000 nonprofessionals from the Los Angeles area; at least 150 community groups, particularly nonarts focused groups, will have received program support to plan their own public drawing event, and will be inclined to use participatory art making experiences with their audiences to draw business; and awareness of the value of community arts engagement and active nonprofessional art making will increase among Los Angeles area leaders and artists.





We will also evaluate our success through: tracking the number of people who participate in individual BDLA events; tracking the number of users of our online and mobile resources; and tracking the number of community groups who register public BDLA events along with an analysis of the type of organizations presenting BDLA events.





We plan to assess qualitative factors through debriefing sessions with the advisory group, post â€“event facilitated discussions with event organizers, and an analysis of participating demographics.


","By using both traditional and nontraditional venues such as parks, public libraries, community centers, city streets, parking lots, theaters and train stations, we are able to reach underserved Los Angeles populations that may not seek or view art in their daytoday activities, and engage them in the act of creation. Participating in art making and cultural activities leads to a stronger community and enhances human development at the individual level.





As before, we expect that numerous museums, schools, cultural organizations, galleries, and even retail outlets will participate this October in The Big Draw LA. By having all the events marketed jointly, participants who participate in an event in their own neighborhoods first may be enticed to visit an unfamiliar venue for another event later in the month. By further diversifying the array of presenting venues, we want to be sure there are drawing events close to residents from across the Los Angeles region. While one may not expect to see a drawing activity at a park or on a local street during daily activities (commuting through a transit station, a weekend shopping day, a race or other sports activity, a farmers market), its ease of access may encourage people to stop and participate. The benefits of unique sites can work both ways. Our organization would like the extra resources to provide all art materials, resource guides, and other public awareness materials to our Los Angeles partnersâ€”making it as easy and accessible as possible for a traditional or nontraditional venue to host a Big Draw LA event for their surrounding communities. 





For many people, the notion of drawing can be intimidating. Most do not consider themselves to be artists; yet we know that drawing is something rewarding everyone can do. The informality of the highly participatory experiences, the familiarity of the venues, and the thoughtful planning of the presenters fosters a positive experience. In our previous three years of BDLA, we found that many participants simply discovered our flagship â€œMake Your Mark in the Parkâ€ event while walking through Exposition Park or Grand Park to get somewhere else.  These people stayed and seemed delighted to have discovered the opportunity to â€œget back to drawing,â€ and were willing to not just watch their children draw, but to draw with them, and happily took a sketchbook to â€œdo moreâ€ as they left. By bringing activities close to home, and in many cases, integrated as an extension of other activities the family is already engaged with, it is more likely that they will choose to participate, and feel it was a fulfilling experience worth repeating. We hope that this will bring active participation in cultural and artistic activities to the many pockets of the Los Angeles area.


","The Big Draw LA encourages participants to rediscover the power of drawing as both a tool and as a way of seeing the world.  In 2050, the phrase â€œI canâ€™t drawâ€ would be removed from our collective rhetoric.  Drawing, like speaking, writing and mathematics, would be a ubiquitous language of communication among all people.  Drawing would be a basis for social interactions and understanding.  Just as penmanship is secondary to the idea conveyed through language, oneâ€™s skill in drawing would be secondary to the concept being explored or exchanged with others.  Tablet technologies, with their numerous drawing and collaborative whiteboard applications, are currently blurring the line between artist and nonartist and expanding the definition of drawing into a form of communication.   Additionally the global connectivity of the internet allows us to share or even collaborate on drawings with people who speak different languages. With the Big Draw LA initiative, we hope that the year 2050 will be one of open, accessible, and welcomed participation in artistic and cultural activities without any feelings of unfamiliarity or intimidation for members of the Los Angeles community. This will also link directly with active engagement at our cityâ€™s many artistic and cultural offerings at both traditional venues (e.g. museums) and nontraditional venues (e.g. your local cafÃ© or Laundromat). Overall, we will uphold the positive economic impact of these activities within our greater Los Angeles. "
3102216,2013216,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Sabio.html,A HighPaying HighTech Jobs Solution For Those That Need It The MOST, Income & Employment,"Sabio will train unemployed, underemployed and underrepresented individuals from LA, via an accelerated learning program, to enter the technology sector so that they can participate in today's hightech economy. We will utilize an immersive boot camp environment to create a workforce that sets the standard for entry level technologists. Sabioâ€™s training program will simultaneously serve to cure the current imbalance in the existing technology workforce, which suffers from a largely homogeneous make up. 


This training can be completed in as little as 3 months. Other areas of the country are having great success in producing employable talent in this same time. With Sabio, LA can have a program of its own.


Just 7 years from now there will be 1 Million technology jobs that will go unfilled because we do not have a properly trained workforce. This represents $500 Billion in wages that Sabio will bring to LA by training Los Angelinos to fill these jobs. The Bay Area Council Economic Instituteâ€™s Local Jobs Multiplier indicates that for every 1 hightech job created 4.3 other jobs are created. Therefore, developing and strengthening the areaâ€™s hightech sector will have a significant impact in the local economy by promoting growth.


However, we do not have to wait 7 years to start taking advantage of the lucrative salaries in the hightech sector. In fact, we do not even have wait the years it takes colleges and universities to produce this talent. Sabio graduates can fill the many currently available positions.


Sabioâ€™s training staff will be seasoned professionals currently exercising their programming skills. More specifically, they will also have a proven history of successfully mentoring entry level programmers. 


Our training will be conducted in a format that is best described as a â€œbootcamp.â€ This format will approximate the intensive nature of a startup and prepare our trainees for the most rigorous environments. Our official training hours will be conducted 5 days a week and over the course of three to four months.


Another key differentiating aspect of the Sabio program is its immersive environment. Our training facility will be colocated with other hightech startups. Throughout the training program the trainees will be deliberately exposed to real world professionals, allowing them to build their network of contacts and be uniquely prepared to enter the tech workforce.


By training unemployed, underemployed, and underrepresented individuals that live in LA, Sabio directly impacts all the metrics noted in the LA2050 Report for employment and income.  Many careers in technology have starting salaries that are higher than the median income for individuals. This is more pronounced when comparing the median incomes of Latinos and African Americans. In these cases, an entry level tech salary can match that of an entire household of said group.


These salaries allow one working adult to earn approximately 164% of the income need to live comfortably in a household of one. This one adult will also be able to support a family of four within 23 years of completing the Sabio training program. This is possible because of the unique advancement opportunities in the hightech sector that place Sabio trainees on a path to earn $100,000 a year within 5 years of completing the program.


Another aspect of the hightech sector that is important to consider is its extremely low unemployment rate. Varying reports indicate that the unemployment rate for the hightech sector is between 2% and 4%, which is approximately half the national unemployment rate, and 33% of LA Countyâ€™s. Building an economy whose job base is concentrated in a sector with low unemployment naturally brings the overall unemployment rate down.


The nature of the services we will provide will directly decrease the unemployment and underemployment rates in LA. Our strong focus on the bottom quintile of the wealth distribution graph will have a great impact in the area as we will be serving to raise the lowest end of the spectrum. Sabio graduates will enter the high skilled workforce, move off the unemployment rolls and secure an economically advantageous career.


Furthermore, a survey from the Kauffman Foundation found that Latinos and African Americans are highly inclined to start new businesses at a rate of 64% and 63% respectively. Therefore, in empowering our trainees with the technical skills necessary to build and execute on their ideas, we will actually be complimenting their already established desires to start new businesses. 


The technical training that will be provided by Sabio will allow Latinos, African Americans and women to overcome some of the existing barriers that they face in starting a new business. Facilitating their success in building their own businesses will create a synergistic and positive cyclical affect in creating more technology based, minority owned and minority driven companies that create more high quality jobs in LA","<p>Sabio is a brand new organization and has therefore had little opportunity to record many achievements. However, our most noteworthy achievement is that we have already received inquiries from potential candidates for our bootcamp, including actual signups. This has been accomplished through simple messaging on Twitter and with no marketing spend.</p>


<p>In addition, we are happy to report that we have attracted attention from a number of key contacts not only in Los Angeles, but also Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. This includes some high level government agencies.</p>


<p>We have also organized an initial board under our California entity made up of the following individuals: </p>


<p>Christian Sanz: CTO and Founder of geekli.st</p>


<p>Jesse Saucedo: Project Coordinator, Los Angeles Housing Departments</p>


<p>Chantelle Silveira CoFounder of Stealth Startup</p>","The following partners have indicated that they are willing to interview our trainees should they have a need for entry level developers:


Crowd Smart â€“ Santa Monica


Security Frameworks â€“ Marina Del Rey


Putnam Recruiting Group â€“ El Segundo


Marsko â€“ Palos Verdes


Stealth Startup  Chantelle Silveira, CoFounder


In addition, we have a number of local tech community members identified that we will reach out to for mentorship.   We have also secured speakers to discuss specific topics that relate to tech startups, such as securing venture capital, product development, design, quality assurance, and interview preparation.


","The nature of our project lends itself to a set of simple success metrics.


1) The number of trainees completing our training program: This number will tell us how well our selection and screening process is progressing.


2) The number of trainees receiving offers of employment from companies in the tech industry: This number will reflect the quality of our training.


3) The ability of our trainees to retain employment in the tech industry: This will reflect the quality of our training as well as our postgraduation mentorship.


We are expecting to graduate approximately 90% of the people accepted into the program with 80% of original trainees receiving offers of employment.


At a more detailed and micro level we will:


1)Gather feedback from our trainees at least every week


2)Gauge trainee performance at project milestones to ensure they are actually learning the subject material 


","Highlights: 


Decrease the poverty rate by having more of our citizens not only employed but also employed in high paying careers


Decrease the unemployment & underemployment rate in LA by training the current population to fill existing jobs


Increase the number of companies & investors that choose LA as the home for their business


Increase the number of new tech jobs


Increase the median household income


Wealth distribution is significantly more balanced across households


Wealth distribution & median income increases leads to more revenue & business for other sectors of the economy


More tax dollars are collected


Each high tech jobs creates up to 4 other accompanying jobs


The lines that defined the bifurcated economic system that exists in LA are reduced and diminished


Currently, the greater LA metro area is striving to become the next Silicon Valley. In doing so, it is creating a large demand for high skilled technology workers. This makes it a critical period for the technology industry in LA. This industry cannot thrive unless there is an ample supply of qualified technical talent.  Failure to support this industry will not only have a negative result on the number of tech jobs available in the area but also the number of companies that look to staff their tech departments in LA.


As things stand, a variety of tech based positions will go unfilled in the coming years due to the current shortage of qualified workers. This shortage is only expected to get worse.


A large STEM effort has been unleashed in the K12 class rooms, including community colleges and four year universities. However, technology companies need trained technical staff today, not 4 to 12 years from now.  Sabio will meet these demands by training individuals from LA to become entry level web programmers within 4 months.


This approach is practical and feasible and currently in place in other regions of the US. The benefits to the city and area are numerous. Providing a healthy pool of technical candidates for companies will encourage them to stay & at the same time incentivize entrepreneurs and capital, of many different sources, to start their new companies here.


Five years after graduating our target trainees are expected to be earning ~$100K/yr and contributing ~$58K/yr more into local economy and paying ~250% more taxes than in their previous career. Multiplying this number by 45, the number of estimated trainees in year 1, we can estimate that Sabio trainees will contribute close to $2.6M to the local economy.  


Finally, the Local Jobs Multiplier chart, produced by the BACEI, captures a measure of the impact any one job has on the local economy by means of supporting other local job creation. High tech jobs have been found to create jobs at a rate of 4.3, meaning that any 1 high tech job will create 4.3 other jobs. Referencing this multiplier we can estimate that Sabio will help fill 45 jobs and create, indirectly, 193 other jobs yearly.


","<p>In the year 2050, the economic impact of the high technology sector of Los Angeles dwindles that of the entertainment industry.  Los Angeles is now the new center of technology in the United States. It is not only the home of the largest concentration of technologist, it is also the most diverse and therefore most innovative. </p>


<p>Outside business and Venture Capital consider Los Angeles first when starting new endeavors. Meanwhile, a strong entrepreneurial culture pervades the region. The largely Latino and African American population is empowered with the technical skills needed to start and build their small businesses.</p>


<p>After nearly 40 years of stressing technology literacy, Los Angeles now attracts the most talented individuals to the region. The migration of talent, young and old, out of Los Angeles, is a memory. This serves to further solidify our future economic standing in the nation.  </p>


Our continued focus on maintaining a welltrained and diverse hightech workforce has erased most of the bifurcations that existed along ethnic or racial boundaries.  The hightech workforce now strongly mirrors the areaâ€™s demographics.  The large number of technology jobs has also spurred a growth in supporting sectors, which serve to provide significant employment opportunities for the rest of the population.


<p>This wealth of jobs across all sectors balances wealth distribution and raises the standard of living across the board. This is reflected in the lowest unemployment and poverty rates in the nation.</p>"
3102217,2013217,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SkidRow2050.html,Skid Row 2050, Housing,"Skid Row 2050 will reimagine how Skid Row can be transformed into a thriving and sustainable <i>neighborhood</i> that embodies social equity and urban revitalization. Our goal is to create a communitydriven housing and neighborhood development plan that prioritizes people and placemaking. As the homeless capital of the country, Skid Row is often perceived of as the landmark of social and physical blight: there needs to be a new focused effort to reframe Skid Row as a community of permanently housed residents rather than a space of transition or social isolation.  With thousands of longterm residents who call this place home, the neighborhood can no longer be a remnant of the city, shaped by unplanned and unintended development.  By revisioning this area in a cohesive and impactful way, we can begin to stitch Skid Row back into the fabric of Los Angeles.


<br/><br/>


Our proposed project will lay the groundwork to create a neighborhood development plan through the following three phases 1) community engagement and research with current and local residents  2) design sessions with national leaders in community development and design, and 3) public exhibition of the community process and visions for Skid Row in 2050.  


<br/><br/>


<b>Phase 1: Community Engagement and Research</b><br/>


The first phase is comprised of interactive design workshops with community members to get their priorities at the core of research.  We will develop engagement tools that include a mobile planning kiosk, graphic surveys, and models for interactive design sessions.  The outreach and research will serve as a needs assessment for housing, essential public amenities, necessary social services, and public safety.  We will look for threats that weaken the social structure and jeopardize the stability of the neighborhood, preventing continuous and positive growth.  We will evaluate existing resources and cultural assets, exploring the positives that exist today in the area, something that is often underexposed.  Using the participatory research from Phase 1, we will create a programmatic framework of opportunity for community and housing development.  


<br/><br/>


<b>Phase 2: Design Sessions with Leaders and Community members</b><br/>


The second phase will be a series of design and policy workshops to create a vision of Skid Row in the year 2050. Using the eight indicators developed by LA2050 as a framework for conversation, we will invite thought leaders and community members to brainstorm how the neighborhood priorities would physically manifest in the built environment.  We will also design funding opportunities and generate policy recommendations needed to implement the development plan.  We plan to invite crossdisciplinary leaders in the field of architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, financing and lending, philanthropy, and policy.  From the working design sessions, we will produce drafts of a comprehensive neighborhood development plan for Skid Row 2050.


<br/><br/>


<b>Phase 3: Public Exhibition and Dialog</b><br/>


The third phase will be a public exhibition of the process of developing Skid Row 2050.  On display will be the engagement tools, direct community input gathered, and synthesized plans from the working sessions.  We plan to curate a series of lectures and community events alongside the public exhibition.


<br/><br/>


The proposal starts with big ideas and speculation on the possibilities of the future of Skid Row, but we seek to map out concrete steps needed in the shortterm, so that we can attain the 2050 vision.  Skid Row can embody all the positive indicators of a flourishing city, composed of sustainable affordable housing, safe attractive public spaces, and economic opportunity, that is connected to the larger region.  ","The project is spearheaded by the Skid Row Housing Trust, a nonprofit affordable housing developer that has been building homes in Skid Row for more than twenty years. Our greatest achievement to date is the development of over 1,600 units of highquality, sustainable, and affordable homes for the lowest income, formerly homeless, and disabled population. The Star Apartments, currently under construction, builds on our successes by pushing innovations in social service delivery, architectural design, and construction. The Star will be the home to 100 formerly homeless individuals.  In addition to a full medical clinic on the ground floor, the Department of Health Services will be headquartered onsite.  By implementing prefabricated modular housing, the project uses new construction methods for costsavings and timeefficient construction.  With the inclusion of over 15,000 SF of community building activity space, the Star will be the hub for social interaction between all the Trustâ€™s projects.  The project will be the first of its kind for supportive housing in Los Angeles.


<br/><br/>


We believe that shelter alone is not enough to break the cycle of poverty; by providing intensive onsite social services along with therapeutic activities such as yoga, gardening and art classes, we have been able to see personal transformations within our resident community. We have successfully partnered with many financing institutions, public agencies, council members, service organizations, foundations, and other community stakeholders to develop our housing projects. 


<br/><br/>


In addition to servicerich environments, we have partnered with leading architects and designers, such as Michael Maltzan Architecture, Koning Eizenberg Architecture, and Killefer Flammang Architects, to bring high design and highquality homes to our residents.  Our projects push for design equity and bring design excellence to populations who need it most.  Our work has won accolades from AIA/LA, Westside Urban Forum, SCANPH, CSH, and others and include an AIA/HUD Secretary Excellence in Affordable Housing Design Award.  Our projects have been included in numerous publications including the NY Times, LA Times, Architectural Record, NPR, Atlantic Cities, the Wall Street Journal, Dwell Magazine, local news channels and beyond.","During the community engagement portion, we will work with local partners, including the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center, in addition to the Skid Row Housing Trust Resident Ambassadors for outreach to participants.  Urban design charrettes led by James Rojas (www.placeit.org) will facilitate the communityâ€™s articulation of the needed elements necessary to create home and place.  We will conduct surveys and street outreach to get a comprehensive understanding of the community and their needs.  We will work with Rosten Woo (www.wehavenoart.net) to develop graphic materials that synthesize the research to ensure legibility and public consumption.  Additional collaborators are anticipated and will be announced.","The project will be evaluated on participation, process, and product.  We will use both quantitative and qualitative metrics to monitor the projectâ€™s success. For the engagement phase, we will rely on meaningful participation of the Skid Row population.  To monitor our success in facilitating this inclusion, we plan to keep a scorecard of participation through all three phases, tracking the number of people in the workshops and levels of participant satisfaction, to ensure the community felt their voices were heard. We plan to use several engagement tactics with a goal of reaching at least 2,000 participants through workshop attendance and surveys.  For process improvement, we will include feedback loops between attendees and facilitators.  We will use evaluation surveys for input after each session to understand what exercises were successful and effective.  To ensure successful product delivery, the exhibition will include a participatory element that will allow the public to comment, critique, and enrich the conversation.  At each phase, we will measure success by attaining a 75% participant satisfaction rate, based on content, inclusion, and engagement.  We plan to hold multiple sessions in each phase, building upon feedback to confirm highimpact events. 


<br/><br/>


This community development plan is envisioned as a concrete way of holistically addressing the social and physical problems of the area and a way to begin creating pathways to permanent solutions.  If we can bring larger dialog and attention to this problem, with community support, we see this as a successful project.  Homelessness is a social issue that no Angeleno can avoid. The project will begin the conversation on how to end homelessness, unit by unit, block by block, one neighborhood at a time.  Success will be realized when stakeholders begin to account for the validity of the voices from those already on Skid Row who consider the neighborhood their home.","The goal of the project is to create an inclusive and consensusbased model for healthy community development.  We plan to develop policy suggestions and design possibilities of the built environment in Skid Row, transforming the lowestincome area of Los Angeles.  Additionally, we want the existing population in Skid Row to have a vested interest in their community and increase a sense of ownership and buyin for the area.


<br/><br/>


The ultimate goal of this project is to create a living product that creates an infrastructure for development and inclusion that fosters growth and transformation in the area.  This community plan will raise awareness to a part of Los Angeles that has constantly been swept under the rug.  This project will bring attention to a problem that is often marginalized and seen as someone elseâ€™s problem thus perpetuating the social injustice.  By bringing homelessness and the lack of affordable housing to the forefront, we can begin a dialog that puts the most vulnerable at the center of the conversation.  The Downtown Renaissance has never included Skid Row; this is an opportunity to make sure it does not continue to be left out of the conversation.  


<br/><br/>


We aim to expand the dialog around the impact and possibilities of housing.  Rather than just defined as a roof over oneâ€™s head, we hope to activate and push the performative aspects of housing.  We want to redefine housing as intentional components of daily life that have been thoughtfully designed, developed, and operated.  We strive to serve as an example of how housing and the built environment can transform lives and be an active part of the fabric and identity of Los Angeles.  ","A successful project will get multiple, thoughtful visions for a sustainable Skid Row in 2050 based on community engagement and community priorities.  The goal of the project is to visually represent and create solutions to what a successful 2050 will actually look like.  We donâ€™t just want to talk about it, we want to collectively envision solutions and create a feasible and comprehensive road map to get there."

3102219,2013219,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/slakelosangeles.html,Slake: Los Angeles,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Slake: Los Angeles is the first journal of narrative nonfiction, fiction, essay, memoir, photography and poetry in Los Angeles to gain worldwide recognition for its quality and design. Slake is devoted to the art of narrative storytelling in a media landscape where that mission is increasingly difficult and rare, but ever more essential. Storytelling breeds empathy and understanding, which improve community engagement and increase our civic stake.





Slake will continue to give voice to the intellectual and creative resources of Los Angeles and shows them to the world at a time when Los Angeles is becoming the most important city in America as we move further into the 21st Century. Slake's highly attended readings, events, and Slake After Dark author and musician series will continue rally the literary and arts community to Los Angeles' civic mission. 





Most importantly, Slake will expand it's mission to include a publishing imprint that will bring the projects of underserved LA writers and artists to the world. There is no reason Los Angeles should rely on the permission of New York to get its creative capital disseminated. ","Most importantly, Slake proved Los Angeles can produce a beautiful, exciting, smart journal of arts and letters that bridges the gap between stagnant oldworld iterations of such and the future of longform publishing. Slake is as intelligent as it as it is lovely and its success belies the myth that people don't have time or don't want to engage with more indepth narrative. We've raised expectations for both Los Angeles and for the world as to what we should expect from a Los Angeles journal. Meanwhile, we've provided much needed gravity around which this often diffused community. ","Our partners will be the universities (USC and Occidental) where we have established relationships as well as such cultural programs as The Hammer, where we've done successful events, and venues such as The Bootleg Theater and many other programming venues throughout the city and Pasadena at which Slake has provided rich, exciting events as well as venues such as Track 16 and Atwater Crossing to which Slake has brought hundreds to thousands of Angelenos for evenings of art, literature and music. We also collaborate with bookstores throughout the region, where our readings are often among the best attended. Slake has done highly successful programming for social and political events such as All in For the 99 and will continue to do so. ","Slake will measure success by increasing subscriptions, sales, event attendance and national and international recognitions, such as Cindy Carcamo's piece from Slake #2, ""Return To Sender"" winning international awards for immigration reporting and stories by Richard Lange, Joe Donnelly, Harry Shannon, Erica Wrightson, Joseph Mattson and others who have been recognized by The Best American series. Mostly, though, we'll measure our success by sustaining and growing Los Angeles' literary and artistic ","Los Angeles, the gateway to Latin America and the Pacific Rim is criminally disadvantaged when it comes to disseminating and distributing the work of its artists, writers and intellectuals. This is primarily the means of production (and locus of prejudice towards Los Angeles) in publishing remain in New York. In it's brief history, Slake: Los Angeles, A City and its Stories, has competed with the best journalis in the world and won. Slake has been honored by press clubs, Pen Center, Livingston Awards, Franco American Foundation, and the prestigious Best Of American series five times (in two eligible issues). This is a remarkable feat and it's been accomplished because nobody know and can harness LA's talent better than Slake and its editors, Joe Donnelly and Laurie Ochoa. 





Los Angeles needs and deserves a prominent voice and forumn for its creative and intellectual talent to present to the world. Los Angeles is critical to the 21st Century, the privileges and problems of which will unfurl in LA first. ","Los Angeles, the premiere city of the 21st Century would own its own means of production for producing and publishing for broad consumption its intellectual, artistic and academic capital. "
3102220,2013220,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/smartestk12.html,Lets eliminate the education gap: smartestk12 is built by teachers to prepare LA for the CommonCore, Education,"By 2050, the injustice that is the education gap must be defeated.  There is no panacea and the answer is not as simple as choosing charter schools, dethroning Unions, or betting the house on a learning style.  There will never be a silver bullet, but the closest answer that we have is a full focus on tracking student data and promoting teacher effectiveness.  Thankfully, the Common Core State Standards combined with LAâ€™s digital revolution enable a rare chance to understand and to address individual student knowledge gaps and to promote school successes in real time.





Smartestk12.com is a website for teachers to upload their tests and quizzes into one unified database.  Once uploaded, the site will strip unnecessary formatting of word documents and pdfs to enable a virtually limitless array of standardsaligned questions for each grade level and subject matter.  Like searching for an image on google, teachers will now be able to effortlessly find the best questions for their lessons.  Meanwhile, the teacher community can edit, moderate and improve the resources to create the smartest test solutions for our students.





The real magic is what we can do for students.  For the first time ever,  we will be able to provide a khanacademyesque practice world for all content areas, including essayformatted ELA questions.  Each student may log in and take their teacherâ€™s assessments online and be recommended for the best computer adaptive practice.  The data generated by this site automatically builds individual reports for instant tracking to schools as well as parents via email and text messages.  Our computer adaptive platform discovers areas of student learning deficiencies and then presents aid for that material in an actionable manner to all parties, including the students themselves; all instantly.





Beyond the benefits of measured student growth, smartestk12 also addresses three critical education events: LAUSD's tablet/chromebook push, the common core, and teacher evaluation.





First, as a former intern at Beaudry through the Teach For America Summer Leadership Fellows Program, our founder worked with Superintendents Dr. John Deasy and Tommy Chang.  In this position, he was intimately seated with the small data team and IT department.  With the recent announcement for LAUSD to buy 600,000 chromebooks, as well as the thousands of iPads and other digital media ordered in this latest $500,000,000 spending spree, it is clear that LAUSD is serious about their commitment to fully digitize the district.  However, it is fair to be extremely skeptical that the immense resources will be utilized to their fullest extent in the coming tech rollout.  Instead of focusing on bestpractices, the limited LAUSD team is tied to the logistics involved in delivering the devices.  My district office friends admit the heavy need for more programs put in place to ensure that the new devices will have true accountability. Smartestk12 can provide such accountability through daily/weekly interim assessments for each student, using our virtually unlimited database of questions and computer adaptive technique.  In order to achieve audacious growth, we can provide a robust intervention plan for all students in need.  Once ready, smartestk12 is set to immediately support several schools within LAUSD, and plans to work directly with the SIS system for easy integration.





Second, the Common Core State Standards will begin in the 20142015 school year.  While Los Angeles appears to be on the leading edge with the Common Core implementation, it is still highly debatable if any success will occur in the transition.  Rather than gambling on our students, smartestk12 is focused on providing leading content, teachermade for LAâ€™s classrooms.  Beyond the best teachers, we aim to license preexisting databases such as Teach For America and Khanacademy.





Third, the current federal and state requirements are now set to include test scores into teacher evaluations.  Smartestk12 will not only reduce the heavy weight on end of year highstakes testing, but also facilitate more authentic time management for teachers, by eliminating test reinvention.  Without testing, too many teachers hide within the system or are not recognized.  Also, too many students fall behind.   Now, smartestk12 will provide a way to showcase student growth for any teacher by breaking the high stakes tests into daily or weekly interim assessments.  Not only will teachers see results immediately; but now, parents, administrators and the students themselves will know exactly where they are succeeding or falling behind and can use our website for enrichment and intervention.  


Smartestk12 is a startup, launched in 2013 in UCLA Andersonâ€™s MBA school and received angel funding from the Larry Wolfen Foundation.  LA schools are already signing up to use smartestk12, but the opportunity to succeed hinges on financial support.","Smartestk12 started as a thousand question science database, parsed from the internet, and used for the academic growth of 800 students in South Gate, California.  It was phenomenally successful, with over 90 students coming to a oneteacher hosted Saturday school workshop.  The students wanted to succeed, and virtually each student who attended the study workshop achieved academic results far beyond what was ""expected"" of them.  That first workshop was the icing on the cake of a recordbreaking academic year for 8th grade science at South Gate Middle School.  However, while 86% of students passed their science exam, only 14% of students passed in mathematics.


Two years later, smartestk12 finally became more than a pet project with funding by the Wolfen Foundation.  We are now getting ready to procure content for all subjects and will become a tool that is perfectly suited to complement any classroom digital device.  ","Collaborators & Advisors:

Founder:


Craig Jones Former 4year teacher, 2008 Teach For America Corps Member, LAUSD District Intern for Tommy Chang, current MBA student at UCLA's Anderson School of Management.  Experienced as edtech vertical intern at Belkin Education, volunteer at DaVinci's US First Robotics Club and Founder of Cabrillo Marine Aquarium's South Gate Research Team","We are a data company and will measure success with results.  True to our name, if we can not measure it then we can not be sure of its importance.  Of paramount importance, success will be measured in the percent of students who grow beyond expected results, the uptake rate and attrition rate of the website, the number of students served and the longterm effect of any growth.  Of particular interest will be which students are served the most and whether the intervention adequately serves its role.  Constant refinement is necessary to validate that growth is a result of our support.  Pyschometric analysis is key to validate any findings.





Success will also be measured in the number of teachers who collaborate, the number of tests generated, the time of use and feedback received.





Parental feedback and usage statistics is especially important as we feel this component is drastically underplayed in current sites of similar nature.  It is far too common to hear that parents think there students are not falling behind, and teachers often struggle to say this to their faces or reveal necessary learning gaps.  As a teacher, our founder visited over 50 families each year and realizes the critical importance of transparent communication with each child's permanent teachers, their guardians.





In conclusion, there will not be a clickable link that will not be evaluated for its effectiveness and value to the user.  We hope to live true to our name of datadriven practice and plan to be on constant alert to fix what is needed and communicate all information externally.","Teaching at South Gate Middle School for the past four years, our founder supported his students towards recordbreaking mastery levels on the California Standards Tests.  Now, the smartestk12 team wants to share the success with all Los Angeles county, and eventually the whole country as we all prepare to meet the digital assessment needs of the impending Common Core.


There is no secret formula to improved success in the classroom, yet no one can argue in the power of data.


Our goal is to make the data tracking process extremely easy and teacherfriendly.  For LA county, this means that all 145,000 students PreK to grade 12 can be standards mapped using our website.  Also, all teachers, parents, and administrators can be held accountable toward their growth.  The current system requires us to wait until August to find out test scores.  While the Common Core will be faster, we will only have data to act on by the end of the year, or at most 23 interim assessments.  Now, with smartestk12, any student can practice every day of the year; and on every subject, including essays.  With this much information, our city can eliminate students falling through the cracks, because we will know performance almost instantly.  In LA, 1 in 4 students drop out because we did not help them in time, and often we did not know where to help them academically.  Likewise, 3 of 5 students do not finish college prep requirements because we push them forward to the next level regardless of any true level of mastery.  With a computer adaptive system, a student in one seat can be practicing in calculus and the student in the other can be working on basic number skills.  Yet, in each program, the student will be receiving content perfectly suited for their needs and the teachers, parents and administrators involved will be 100% aware of those needs.  We can now provide accountability before the end of the year, meaning that LA schools can actually hold data to a teacher or student.  And finally, professional development will match the needs of the teachers, because there will be no hiding from intervention needs.  





LAUSD's chromebook push:


While at LAUSD, our founder built smartestk12 and had a 3year average Academic Growth over Time rating of 5.6 out of 5, placing him in the top 1% in his subject.  This means that his students grew far beyond their expected levels, adjusted by previous scores, ELL status, socioeconomic status, etc.  However, beyond the adjusted growth, his students showed real performance levels in the top of the city, with over 100 students scoring at the highest level (Advanced), annually.  When a system works, it enables critical thinking and more time on quality instruction and meaningful programs for kids.





Smartestk12 will intimately work with LA's schools.  Currently, several have agreed or have shown deep interest in completing Beta Testing this fall, including various LAUSD schools, KIPP LA schools, the UCLA Lab School and the DaVinci Schools.","In 2050, digital devices would support brick and mortar classrooms in such a way that 100% of inclass time is devoted to authentic critical thinking and handson inquiry.  Smartestk12 will not limit a teacher to test prep but instead widen their scope to what truly leads to results.  Our data driven system will expose the real success stories in schools across the region and will enable specific, individualized instruction, as opposed to a onesized fits all methodology.





This type of datadriven instruction and transparency can enable parents, teachers, administrators and students themselves to become champions of their own education.  If learning gaps are known and can be isolated, then intervention can immediately attack deficiencies and growth will occur rapidly.





LA is already a leader in the education digital revolution.  Now, let's make sure that it is known in the future as a success.  Other cities around the world are watching to see how we do.  If we succeed, we can have a profound result for the entire world."
3102221,2013221,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/act2connect.html,Act2Connect, Social Connectedness,"<p>The South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC) aims to develop tools and solutions that can be owned and operated by community residents themselves. If programs addressing social concerns like economic development, early education, and community safety are like a kind of â€œsocial software,â€ then SBCC's approach differs from the standard practice of installing offtheshelf products on every system (i.e., neighborhood). We see ourselves instead as open source developers, creating a basic framework for innovation (a project or initiative), then offering training and support in that framework to independent developers (community residents) operating on their own to solve their own unique problems. </p><p>Given this philosophy of change, our idea is not a surprising one, but one that we believe has the capacity to improve lives, families, and whole communities. Building on the power of networked relationships to â€œcrowdsourceâ€ solutions to seemingly intractable social challenges, we will identify 10 key communities across Los Angeles County that we believe are primed to enter a positive feedback loop of relationshipdriven social capitalbuilding, creating a neighborhood infrastructure that amplifies and intensifies the potentials and resources already present in the community to support wellness, safety, and further connectedness. This feedback loop can be broken down into three phases:</p>





<p>* Phase 1: Connect to Plan</p><p>* Phase 2: Plan to Act</p><p>* Phase 3: Act to Connect</p>





<p>It is in the final phaseâ€”Act to Connectâ€”that the core innovation of our approach takes place. Having built a network of community relationships in order expand the possibilities for effective action, having planned an action in collaboration with neighbors, and having successfully carried out that action, a neighborhood group finds itself in a strengthened network of relationships. This intensified network is both an end in itself (effective, supportive social relationships are a primary indicator of overall quality of life within the emerging methods of measuring the â€œwellness indexâ€ of a place or community), and a means to further, more effective and largerscale action. We believe that this â€œfeedbackâ€ stage is the critical, and toooften overlooked, component in any agenda for lasting social change. For this reason, we have adopted it as the name of our overall initiative, which we call Act2Connect.</p>





<p>Crucial to achieving effective feedback is a longterm investment in neighborhood relationships themselves, which SBCC has been making for more than 5 years in communities across L.A. County, working with neighborhood groups to establish a solid network of relationships, habits of trust, and expectations of mutual support. Many of the lowincome communities in which we work are characterized by highly transient populations, large numbers of recent immigrants without their own social support and kinship networks, and the high â€œopportunity costsâ€ associated with underdeveloped social capital: underutilization of supportive resources, overpayment for basic financial and consumer services, lack of access to job and economic opportunities, etc. Thus, helping individuals and families in these communities navigate a path to social connectedness is a valuable end in itself.</p>





<p>In 10 communities selected for high levels of development among these resident groups, and for a selfidentified focus on issues of community safety and violence prevention, SBCC will deploy the resources of an LA 2050 grant to take the next crucial step in this process. Residents in each community will leverage their network of relationships to plan a project focused on community safety and/or violence prevention, carry that plan into action at a neighborhood level with the assistance of leadership development coaches and community organizers, and use the base of participants in the project to expand overall participation in the community network. </p>





<p>The choice of community safety and violence prevention is not an arbitrary one. Unsafe and violent communities, streets, and homes are problems that grow in the context of social isolation. By collaborating to establish community safety teams, collective commitments to nonviolent streets, and trusted neighborlisteners to help move families suffering from abuse out of the shadows, these projects will achieve two key objectives:</p>





<p>* Contribute to safer communities, thus increasing another crucial element of the neighborhood's â€œwellbeing index,â€</p>


<p>* Build more extensive, more effective social networks, leading to expanded trust, higher levels of civic participation and engagement, increased communitywide knowledge of and access to resources and public forums for action, and a greater sense of investment in the community leading to lower levels of transience and the building of durable neighborhood traditions and residentcontrolled institutions</p>","<p>SBCC has achieved significant communitylevel and countywide impacts in areas including:</p>


<p>Economic Development: For nearly 20 years, SBCC's career training and placement programs have opened up access to livingwage employment for residents of lowincome communities. Over the past 5 or more years, these programs have provided training and placement assistance to more than 150 individuals per year in employment sectors including energy, renewables, digital arts and media, film and video production, and K12 teaching. Placement rates exceed 75%, and 24month community college completion and transfer rates have been as high as 90% (as compared to statewide, 6year rates of less than 30%).</p>





<p>SBCC has adapted this approach to youth entrepreneurship with our innovative Streetcraft LA project, which supports atrisk youth as they develop and market their own lines of apparel and accessories. Additional projects in communitybased agriculture, food service, and neighborhood financial services are currently in development.</p>





<p>Finally, SBCC has used our community organizing project's extensive reach into lowincome, immigrantdense communities to launch a highly successful Deferred Action initiative, placing young adults on the path toward legal residency and full participation in the legitimate economy.</p>





<p>Healthy Childhood and Early Education: SBCC's Community Doula program mobilizes community advocates for women during pregnancy, birthing, and in the postpartum months. These doulas help new mothers navigate the medical system, form healthy attachments with their infants, promote good nutrition and breastfeeding, and engage from birth onwards in activities that support children's cognitive, social and emotional development. The program has proven effective at eliminating infant mortality, significantly increasing rates of breastfeeding, and significantly reducing numbers of lowweight births.</p>


<p>Our Preschool Without Walls program works with families in these communities to address critical gaps in early learning and preschool resources. PWW brings early learning experiences to more than 500 parents and children in community institutions and locations that serve as learning and development resources. In homes and neighborhoods, parks, libraries, and community centers, the program engages parents and children in a shared early learning experience leading to improved child development and school readiness through supporting parents' role as their children's primary educators.</p>





<p>In all of our work, our primary commitment is to develop community capacity to address education, economic development, and other issues in an ongoing way. Provision of highquality direct services is necessary, but does not go far enough: what is needed is the growth of leadership and ownership within communities themselves to carry these initiatives forward on a selfsufficient, sustainable basis.</p>","The only collaborating partner identified in advance for the full scope of the project (i.e., participating across all 10 neighborhoods) is the evaluation team identified above. Individual neighborhood collaborators may include schools, community centers, faith organizations, local social service nonprofits, regional offices of County of City of Los Angeles public agencies, and law enforcement agencies. Determination of these partnerships will be one of the planning goals of the project development phase outlined in our program plan above, and will vary with each individual neighborhood group.","<p>SBCC will work with independent evaluators, Dr. Todd Franke and Dr. Jorja Leap of UCLA, both of whom have extensive experience evaluating the impact of communitybased social networking, capacitybuilding, and relationship development initiatives for clients including First 5 LA, the LA County Department of Children and Family Services, and The California Wellness Foundation.</p>





<p>Evaluators will design survey, interview, and focus group evaluation instruments based on Dr. Franke's existing â€œProtective Factors Survey.â€ These instruments will measure from baselines established when the organizing initiative began in the targeted communities, and will remeasure at or near the start of Act2Connect project planning, and at 6month and 12month intervals, for five individual, family and community â€œprotective factorsâ€ which provide indicators of neighborhood wellbeing. These assessments will be conducted with participants in the Act2Connect action groups, community members participating in their actions and projects, and family members and peer network members not directly involved in the project. These factors are:</p>





<p>* Social connections: Number and intensity of supportive relationships 


  to other individuals and families in the community.</p>


<p>* Access to and utilization of concrete support in times of need: Families 


  need to meet their basic needs (shelter, food, clothing, health care) in 


  order to ensure their own stability and the healthy development of 


  children. This factor is linked to social connection, as families with 


  active networks and community relationships tend to access more 


  resources.</p>


<p>* Parental resilience: Capacity to creatively problemsolve parenting 


  challenges. This factor is strongly linked to optimism and belief in self


  efficacy, which are in turn linked to social connections.


<p>* Knowledge of parenting and child development: Ability to create 


  nurturing and healthy family environments; strongly linked to 


  involvement with resilient, parenting peers.


<p>* Social and emotional competence of children: Children's ability to 


  interact positively with others, selfregulate their behavior and 


  effectively communicate their feelings. This factor is strongly linked to 


  parental resilience which (as indicated above) is in turn linked to social 


  connection.</p>





<p>We hope to establish through this evaluation that overall levels of social connectedness in the community:</p>





<p>* increase over the oneyear Act2Connect project cycle </p>


<p>* increase for participants as well as for the broader community</p>


<p>* are linked in time to key project milestones (completion of project 


  planning, and completion of project); </p>


<p>* increase following the project; and</p>


<p>* are sustained for several months beyond project completion</p>","Our project is anticipated to have shortterm, measurable impacts on levels of violence and features conducive to community safety (traffic planning, street lighting, etc.) in the neighborhoods we target. Increased rates of early disclosure and assistance for domestic violence and child abuseâ€”among populations that are often extremely difficult for more traditional socialservices approaches to reach effectivelyâ€”may be another key beneficial outcome.





However, while these outcomes are worthwhile on their own, we believe that the most significant neighborhoodlevel change (and one that could provide a template for a broader, L.A. Countywide set of practices) will be found in increased levels of social connection in neighborhoods often characterized by precisely the opposite: transient populations, physically dense but largely anonymous living and housing patterns, very low rates of voting and civic engagement, low rates of volunteerism, and pronounced disengagement between generations. By mobilizing a core group of resident volunteer leaders, setting in motion and supporting a project development approach in which they themselves develop and intensity a network of social relationships in the community, and tying this network to a series of safety outcomes explicitly related to neighbortoneighbor trust and support, and to engagement with public institutions and systems, we hope to establish a selfsustaining, growing movement toward connection in each of our 10 targeted neighborhoods. 





We know from data and evaluation (both our own, and a growing research literature) that networks of effective and supportive social relationships are the â€œkeystoneâ€ factor among a group of characteristics variously called â€œprotective factors,â€ â€œwellbeing indicators,â€ or â€œcomponents of resiliency.â€ The presence of these characteristics are what sets successful communities apart from others, even in cases where more traditional indicators of community vitality (wealth and income, levels of educational attainment, etc.) are low. To put it simply, even economically â€œpoorâ€ neighborhoods may be experienced by their residents as desirable places to live and interact if these other factors are present in high levels.





Demonstrating the effectiveness of an approach to promote these connectednessrelated factors at the neighborhood level could have farreaching impacts in L.A. County. Approaches to community safety, economic development, and civic engagement rooted in enforcement, job training, and formal education will always have their place. However, addressing and moving beyond the limits of these approachesâ€”and thus producing real and lasting change in some of the most intractable issue areas facing our underresourced communitiesâ€”becomes possible only through reliance on strategies mobilizing residenttoresident networks of trust and mutual support. These smallscale, residentled institutions are the future of a safe, vibrant, healthy, and just Los Angeles County.","<p>Thirtyseven years from today, the children of Act2Connect participants will be nearing fifty. Many will be parents themselves. Some will be grandparents. Three generations of active, engaged, invested community members will have sustained and deepened the strategies and communityled institutions developed in the project. Neighborhoods will continue to face many of today's challenges. But these neighborhoods' capacity to address and productively answer these challenges will have undergone a complete transformation:</p>





<p>* At the neighborhood middle school, a fight breaks out between students. Teachers convene a meeting of the school's Student Justice Team, which provides a mediated resolution of the conflict and restitution of injuries. This community service involves the previous adversaries in the activities of:</p><p>* The Neighborhood Cooperative Economic Council, whose projects include a network of community gardens whose produce is distributed through a CSA box service. Subscribers can pay cash, or use a local scrip currency accepted throughout the:</p><p>* Local Trading Network, a barterbased system of consumer economics designed to allow for full participation by those employed in the wage economy as well as those who for various reasons (stayathome parenthood, undocumented immigration status) do not conduct all of their economic activities on a monetary basis. Clothing, food, household repairs, bulkpurchased staple commodities and more are available, along with many of the services of:</p><p>* Community workerowned coops, providing employment opportunities beyond traditional job development programs, and equally accessible to the documented and undocumented. Services include landscaping and gardening, baking and catering, financial services, and:</p><p>* A neighborhood childcare coop, informed by current best practices in child development and making full use of the neighborhoods public spaces and buildings. These public spaces are accessible through:</p><p>* A robust network of bike and pedestrian lanes which converge on a neighborhood â€œcoreâ€ incorporating a creative arts block, youth development programs, and community entertainment and convening spaces. Travel to and from events in these spaces is made safe by:</p><p>* A community volunteer Street Team, trained in conflict deescalation and connected to restorative justice councils in the neighborhood as well as a:</p><p>* Domestic violence and abuse prevention dropin center, providing a safe space staffed with trusted neighborhood members in which community residents can seek referrals for help, shelter, mediation and legal services, all before involving:</p><p>* The public child welfare system, which, like other public institutions, now coordinates its work with resident volunteer organizations in the neighborhood, learning from them, leveraging their local knowledgebase and trust relationships, and responding quickly to the resident concerns that they raise.</p>"
3102222,2013222,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ReadySetGold.html,Ready Set Gold!: A Students Guide to a Lifetime of Fitness , Health,"Ready, Set, Gold!, (RSG!) the only program of its kind in the country, tackles the epidemic problems of childhood obesity and diabetes by pairing Olympians and Paralympians with 50 Los Angeles area  public schools, 96% of which are Title 1 in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  The RSG! mission is to increase the statemandated Fitnessgram scores and promote student fitness, nutrition and a healthy lifetime lifestyle in the 5th, 7th and 9th grade physical education classes which are required to take the Fitnessgram test annually. 





Each Olympian/Paralympian is matched to a specific school and meets with their students five  six times during the school year to inspire, educate, empower, and motivate them toward a long and healthy life. Like tobacco cessation and seat belt use, this is a longterm problem we are addressing. 





According to the LA Department of Public Health in 2007, over 440,500 of LAUSD's 5th, 7th and 9th graders were obese (having too much body fat).  Obese children have a greater likelihood of developing risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease which often follow children into adulthood.  Some populations are at higher risk:  lowincome individuals, AfricanAmericans, Latinos, Native Americans which reflect the LAUSD student population:  73% Latino, 11% Black/African, 9% White, 4% Asian and 3% American Indian/Native American.  





In addition to the above health disparities, LAUSD has cut back on physical education (PE) in elementary schools, decreased the number of credentialed PE teachers and increased PE class sizes to 405060 students.  RSG! was designed to supplement and operate in existing PE classes for the 5th, 7th and 9th graders with teachers and Olympians providing the encouragement and drive to be knowledgeable about health, fitness and nutrition as important elements toward a long and healthy life.  What starts in these early years imparts a commitment to a permanent and enduring dedication to highquality health as a responsibility.  ","1) The only program of its kind in the country





2) a public private partnership between the LAUSD and the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games; this partnership works to restore diminishing needed services in the public sector at a time when the current state budget reduces education funding 





3) Reaching approximately 25,000 students annually at no charge to the schools.  





4) A direct services mentoring program inschool model; we reach the students in class where we have some control over their participation.





5) In the first 3 years of the program for those schools participating in RSG!, LAUSD's latest data demonstrated a 41% increase in students passing the California statemandated physical fitness tests aka Fitnessgram which represents minimum levels of fitness that offer protection against the diseases that result from sedentary living.





Current program outcomes for the 20112012 school year show that more than 50% of students that RSG! reached passed at least 5 out of 6 Fitnessgram exercises. 





6) Recognized by Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa, February, 2012





7) Honored at the LA City Council: September, '08 and June, '09





8) Recognized by the LAUSD Board of Education, October, 2008





9) Nominated for the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness & Sports Award for Organizations","Communitybased partners include the Los Angeles Unified School District,  the Los Angeles Mayor's office, Green Dot Public Schools, the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools (PLAS)  the Mayor's program, USC Family of Schools, the Inner City Education Foundation Schools (ICEF), the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games, the Los Angeles Sports Council, Samsung, Los Angeles Police Department Southeast Division, and the Loyola Marymount Family of Schools. ","Quantitatively, RSG! measures the outcomes of our work by the annual Fitnessgram (statemandated physical fitness test) test results taken by the 5th, 7th and 9th graders at the schools RSG! targets.  Current program outcomes show that more than 50% of students that RSG! reached passed at least 5 out of 6 Fitnessgram exercises, i.e., upper body strength, aerobic capacity, curlup, trunk lift, flexibility and body mass index. 





Qualitatively, RSG! participants (teacher, student and Olympian) give us testimonials; here is a sample;  spelling and grammar have been kept in their original form.  





Teacher: Christine Berni Ramos, Elizabeth Learning Center on Olympian Kelly Mitchell: 





â€œKelly (Mitchell) you are the best, I can see the 5th graders motivation and smiles when they are with you from a distanceâ€





Calabash Elementary Student: â€œBefore the ready,set, gold! program I could not even do a single push up and now I can do 3. I say that the best part was meating David Brinton a olimpian of cyling. Another thing is the running. Before I was a running turtle, and now Iâ€™m a running cheetah.""





Olympian: Becky Kim at John Mack Elementary, â€œThe students at John Mack EL were just amazing! So prepared and ready to listen! It was a delight speaking to these group of students!! I had so much fun with them. They were so engaged and asked a lot of questions as well.â€


","RSG! has already benefited Los Angeles  see the results below in evaluating our project quantitatively and qualitatively.  





RSG! reaches approximately 500 students/school (500 x 50 schools = 25,000 annually).  It serves as a continual reminder that the 42 Olympians/Paralympians participating in the program and ranging in age from 20 years old to 72 years old are healthy lifelong models for students in fighting the epidemics of diabetes and obesity because they are the examples of healthy living habits and not diabetic or obese. 





RSG! is a reminder of the pride people felt in 1984 when we held our second Olympics here in Los Angeles; as I travel throughout Los Angeles, those who were here in '84, always have a story to tell on their volunteering, going to an event, and no traffic!  And now Mayor Villaraigosa has tossed our city hat into the ring to host another Olympics in 2024.  Who wouldn't want another one after London's successfully hosting their third Olympics. 





And there's a young man or woman in school now who will be propelled to be an Olympian because of what is set down in LA at this time and become like Olympian David Brinton ('88cycling) who was motivated by watching the Olympics when he was 9 years old or seeing Olympian Paul Gonzales ('84Boxing) the first MexicanAmerican to win a Gold medal.  





 


","1) Ready, Set, Gold! in all LAUSD schools; there are approximately 700 LAUSD schools; Southern California has 800900 Olympians who could cover them.  We have a proven model that recruits them: word of mouth and their professional organization: the Southern California Committee of Olympians/Paralympians.





2) A full time staff to implement and execute the program above; right now we have a fulltime program director and a parttime program manager for 50 schools; the ratio of monitoring the schools is 1:25 schools.  So for 700 schools, we would need 28 people at today's current number.  





3) Tracking and measuring the impact on students over a 2025 year period; what did they learn and take away from the RSG! experience that stayed with them after the program.  We have some anecdotal information now; yet we need to measure.  We will continue with the Cal State LA professor we have now to design and outline a program and using that information, develop knowledge and keep the ideas that work and replace any that don't and add new ones.  We will also consult with kinesiology professionals and use their experience.

3102223,2013223,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ChinatownFoodHub.html,Chinatown Food Hub, Environmental Quality,"Despite living in an agriculturerich state, much of the food we eat in California is imported by large corporations from all across the world, traveling 1,5002,500 miles on average. This adds 250,000 tons of greenhouse gases to our air every year â€“ equal to the emissions from 40,000 cars.  The impact of this has led to:





 <p>


â€¢	Nearly 1,000 cases of asthma


 <p>


â€¢	16,870 missed school days


 <p>


â€¢	37 premature deaths


 <p>





In contrast, local farmers struggle to find sales outlets for their produce. Many rely on farmers markets as their primary source of income, despite the widely acknowledged fact that farmers markets are highly unstable revenue sources. On a bad day, a farmer might make only $100 in sales â€“ not nearly enough to cover the cost of gas and wages. At the same time, many small businesses in Los Angeles, such as the many familyowned small businesses in Chinatown, struggle to provide high quality produce at prices that local residents can afford. 





 <p>


SSG/Asian Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance (APIOPA) proposes to connect small, local farmers to small businesses in Chinatown and transform it into a regional food hub.  By cutting out the middleman, we would reduce overhead costs to small businesses and customers,   and guarantee a steady source of income for the small farmers, all the while reducing our food miles and greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, our idea is to establish a regional food hub that would serve as a model for systemic change to how food supply lines currently work. Creating such a mass infrastructure change in Chinatown requires a lot of planning, which is why our proposal is to use the allotted funding to develop a sound and detailed business plan, utilizing our grant period to do the necessary research, marketing analysis, branding, and strategic planning.





 <p>


In Chinatown, we can successfully create a food hub by tapping into the current local small business community, and their knowledge of local markets and the community, to create a business model that not only provides healthy and affordable produce for residents, but also preserves the heart and soul of Chinatown. We will work directly with local Hmong and Filipino small farmers residing in Central California. These farmers generally grow Asian produce and make the trek down to Southern California once a week to sell at Farmersâ€™ Markets. Under our regional food hub model, we would coordinate with the farmers to purchase their crops in bulk, and have this delivered to one central location in Chinatown. The idea is that if we create a regional food hub, we can then control some of the supply lines, therefore driving down prices for produce that may regularly be more expensive.  





 <p>


The beauty of this model is that we already have the supply (local Asian farmers) and the demand (residents, small businesses) for fresh Asian produce; what we need is funding to develop the logistics and implementation of the regional food hub, which includes the creation of a detailed business plan, technology and customer service development, and marketing/branding. With the funding, we would invest heavily in researching and developing these logistics because they are the key to establishing a successful and sustainable regional food hub. 


","SSG/APIOPA


 <p>


â€¢	Established an Asian CommunitySupported Agriculture program, working with local Hmong farmers and selling in Downtown Los Angeles and Historic Filipinotown. We have sold out all of our subscriptions. 


 <p>


â€¢	Implemented a program called SAFE for APIs with the policy goal of helping children maintaining a healthy weight through the improvement of public park facilities. The program addresses health disparities by seeking to increase access to physical activity in neighborhoods where Pacific Islander (PI) populations are the densest.  Our program works with local government agencies, to adopt standards for safety, cleanliness, and culturally competent family programming to promote active and healthy lifestyles. 





 <p>


 <p>


SEACA


 <p>


â€¢	Trained hundreds of students to become leaders in LA and our work with youth, as profiled in Hector Tobar's column for the LA times


 <p>


â€¢	Worked with youth and policy experts to craft a community development policy  described as ""A Model of LA Planning,"" which will set strong environmental and equity protections for local residents 


","One of our key partners will be the Southeast Asian Community Alliance (SEACA). SEACA is a nonprofit organization based in Chinatown, whose mission is to empower Southeast Asian youth in their community. SEACA is an integral partner because not only do they have connections to youth and residents in Chinatown, but also have experience organizing small business owners in the community as well as local, regional, and national environmental organizations that can provide us with technical assistance.","We will measure the success of our project through the completion of our deliverables. More specifically, by the end of the grant period, all research will be completed and we will have a finished business plan, which includes technology, marketing, branding, and other aspects we need to successfully implement the regional food hub. ","Our vision is to have a triple bottom line: support local businesses and farms, provide vital sustenance to local communities, and support a greener environment. 





 <p>


Chinatown is home to over 15 markets that sell Asian produce. Currently many of these markets are getting the last pick of produce from suppliers because they cannot compete with the big box retailers; according to the owners, the profit margins are extremely narrow. With the regional food hub model, we would directly source to these markets and corner stores at an affordable rate while simultaneously reducing a key contributer to LA's pollution problem.


 <p>


By connecting local businesses directly to local farmers, we have the ability to improve economic, health, and environmental outcomes in our community in the following ways:





 <p>


â€¢	For every $100 spent at a local business, $45 stays in the  community, compared to only $13 if the money is spent at a national chain store.





 <p>


â€¢	Most chain stores source their produce from thousands of miles away, whereas our model will be sourcing produce from 200 miles away, significantly lowering our carbon footprint.





 <p>


â€¢	Improving the type and quality of produce available will increase access, consumption, and demand of healthy, high quality, locally grown food by residents.





 <p>


The regional food hub not only supports and grows the capacity of local small businesses, but it also helps do the same for the farmers we will work with. The regional food hub will invest funds early to developing our small business partners within the community. Workshops and capacity building for the local farmers and the small business owners we will be working with will be crucial in how well this model performs. By having stronger small businesses, Los Angeles will see great benefits not only from greater access to healthy food,  but also from greater economic output and cleaner air. If we succeed in reducing just 0.01% of our food miles we will have 25 tons fewer of global warming gases in LA.





 <p>


Here are some of the current facts about health in LA County: 


 <p>





â€¢	In LA City Council District 1, which includes Chinatown, adult obesity rates are at 23.3% and childhood obesity rates are at 27.8%. (CCPHA, Obesity and Mortality Report, 2011)





 <p>


â€¢	Asians across Los Angeles County have low rates of eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day; only 35.9% of Asians eat the recommended amount of produce in a given day. (CHIS, UCLA 2009)





 <p>


â€¢	53.9% of Chinatown residents are not eating the recommended 5 fruits and vegetables a day. (CHIS, UCLA 2005)


","Our vision for 2050 is to create a healthy and thriving system of locally sourced food in Chinatown that can serve as a model of sustainability for the rest of the City.  By following through on our business plan and creating the actual Chinatown food hub, we will be connecting local farmers to local businesses and residents. We will be creating an alternative system that would ensure fair prices for consumers,  fair wages for farmers and workers, and better air quality for the whole city. It is also our hope that because we are sourcing food locally, we would rebuild the connections between growers and consumers that have been largely abandoned by a more industrial food sourcing system."
3102224,2013224,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/sjbsocialservices.html,Building Bridges in the San Gabriel Valley: Social Connectedness in Action, Social Connectedness,"The San Gabriel Valley currently lacks solid social connectedness; this project aims to change this dynamic.





First, the area, like much of Los Angeles is experiencing demographic changes. This is definitely true in the San Gabriel Valley as newly arriving Latinos and AsianPacific Islanders mix with existing 2nd5th Generation Latinos. This project seeks to alleviate some of the tensions change can bring by starting dialogues and workshops led by established professional facilitators. These dialogues seek to bring different cultures with very different experiences and expectations for life in the San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles together in order to connect and work together, rather than exist in clusters individually. The idea is to use methods similar to successful â€œblackbrownâ€ projects in Los Angeles and make them relevant to the region and its needs. The dialogues would be adapted for language needs. This segment will be aided by previous experience working with NCCJ (National Conference for Community & Justice). The first step in growing connectedness is to have different groups actually connect; this project begins those linkages.





The second area of the project to expand social connectedness is to partner with LA Voice in expanding the region. Currently, LA Voice has many strong clusters in Los Angeles; but, it has a lone operation in the San Gabriel Valley (in Baldwin Park).  This project sees the formation of a regional base and expansion into many more congregations. 





LA Voiceâ€™s expansion would greatly aid social connectedness. In individual congregations, it would create opportunities for individuals to learn how to gain influence and change their communities.  Regional meetings would bring these congregations together in actions and planning sessions, which grow area connectedness. LA Voiceâ€™s network across Los Angeles provides further opportunities for connectedness at meetings and actions.  This effect is further amplified with statewide conferences of the PICO Network which will allow San Gabriel Valley residents to develop ideas and learn from other Californians beyond relying on emails or news reports. 





The third segment is the hosting of events to grow social connectedness. For example, preparations are underway for a higher education presentation that would include universities, counselors, immigration assistance, and local successful graduates, including a commitment from a locallyraised government official currently working in Washington, D.C. With ongoing budget cuts and cultural issues, an event held independently of school has very significant promise to connect a wide pool of potential candidates to resources needed to attend higher education. Hosting â€œget acquaintedâ€ meetings for local businesses, politicians, and leaders is designed to provide nonconfrontational opportunities for contact among what has been at time a contentious environment rather than confrontational or negotiating situations. The project also sees quarterly menâ€™s and womenâ€™s contact group meetings to discuss issues they feel are pertinent. Citizenship events are another key component. These events help residents move from residency through the application process and examinations to full Unietd States citizenship. The citizenship steps also introduce people to â€œthe systemâ€ and strongly encourage voting and voter awareness of issues. These events ranging from higher education awareness to more regular contact sessions and promote new linkages for the area.





The fourth area is training to improve social connectedness. Training will make presentations, events, and communications more effective. The training will include making sue of technology to improve presentations. Staff development will also help the program deal with the community changes already discussed. The project also plans to send teens to leadership development training. In this area youth leadership is often not fully nourished; the goal of the training is to have youth involved and to prepare them for greater success.





The fifth area to improve social connectedness is capability upgrades through technology and equipment. Currently, the Social Services program relies on â€œlow techâ€ communications. This project sees program gaining a major boost in longterm capability to connect with society through laptop computers, a scanner, PowerPoint projectors, significantly upgraded telephones to allow for more efficient phone banks, and data transfer equipment. The equipment upgrades will make communications more effective. For example, a bilingual PowerPoint presentation in AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogues will now be possible. Likewise, nonpartisan voting telephone reminders will be far easier to perform with upgrades. Communication improvements will literally boost social connectedness.





Social Connectedness is a complex concept; improving social connectedness is even more challenging. This project  faces the challenge.


","St. John the Baptist Social Service has a long history of involvement in the community, aiding those in need. The program has been meeting the many economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully adjusting to changes in the area since 194.





In the past few years, the program has also sought to increase linkages between different parts of society. Baldwin Park and surrounding cities have had some issues with having government, business, organizations, and the population working together such as with redevelopment issues. 





An example is the start of the Cesar Chavez Interfaith Breakfast, which for the first time brought together community leaders, business owners, labor leaders, clergy from several denominations, public sector employees, and politicians together in a nonformal gathering. The event allows people to meet others while also hearing different perspectives, such as a rabbi who worked with Cesar Chavez to a local graduate who has become principal of one of the cityâ€™s high schools.  Attendees leave with new contacts and possibilities.





There has been great success in having community voices heard with more influence at city hall. After a fatal traffic accident, the program teamed with LA Voice and other congregations to seek a solution to an ongoing danger.  This combined campaign led to a rapid decision by the city to install a new traffic light, which is now in service. The campaign prompted local officials to act far faster than normal.





An ongoing success has been getting community members much more involved in local issues. An example is the cityâ€™s study of whether to retain the local police department or contract with the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department. Now, community members are attending hearings, giving their opinions and staying informed of events in the debate. In previous years this process would largely have been ignored by the public and not been influenced by their views. The local officials now know their decisions are being monitored. Creating public accountability is a major gain for this area.





A significant achievement has been making connections to more effectively serve those in need, something that before was more provincial. The Social Services program has adjusted the annual Thanksgiving food drive to partner with the school district and their family liaison officers to identify people in need. This has led to a much better evaluation of the needs of the community and reduced fraud. Now, verified families in need have Thanksgiving food boxes delivered to their homes. This partnership is helping both parties ensure aid is effective to maximize results. 





The Social Services program has been developing greater and deeper linkages in the community to provide better delivery of resources. This project will take this process even further to yield wonderful dividends. The foundation of social connectedness has been established; now, the program looks to grow the structure.


","The project seeks to use diverse partnerships to improve its reach and effectiveness.





1)	LA Voice, established in 2000, aids congregations throughout Los Angeles in forming leaders to improve their communities. It is also a member of the national PICO network.





     2)   Baldwin Park Unified School District	 already works with the program in areas such as identifying families in crisis and advancing education for youth and teens. This project would use school liaisons to make the planned activities as wellknown as possible.





     3)   The project will involve other congregations in the area. Already, there are joint projects with Baldwin Park United Methodist Church and CLUE members. This project will enhance those connections.


","This project is not solely a project where simple headcounts or signatures on a page are the signs of success; this project will be accountable beyond statistics.





Some successes will be easy to measure. Were the proposed additional equipment purchased? A â€œYesâ€ means the project has successfully increased capacity significantly for communication. Here a â€œheadcountâ€ for PowerPoint projectors is obviously an easy task. Likewise, telephone upgrades are easily quantifiable to see that capacity has increased for phone banks and similar events. Laptops again are quantifiable and quickly add mobility and capacity to communication. A scanner is quantifiable and will boost connectedness by adding electronic capabilities to presentations and communications.





In less quantifiable area, the results will still exist and be more oriented towards â€œpeople powerâ€ and â€œsoft power.â€  The effects though will be profound.





+ Success for AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogue will be measured in creating a sustainable series in the region. Establishing the foundation for this dialogue will be the first success, especially as it will be novel in the area. 


+ Second, holding the events and workshops will be quantifiable. The results are less numeric and more longterm; but, attendance should create grounds for success and improve the region as demographics change.


+Third, seeing results for the expansion of the LA Voice presence will be ongoing. The project sees LA Voice growing from one congregation in the San Gabriel Valley to a substantial presence across the region and in a range of faiths. Success sees local organizing committees being established and active, connecting people in new ways and increasing their ability to promote change in their communities. 


+ Fourth, the events part of the project again will yield less quantifiable results. These planned events will result in greater connectedness among disparate parts of society: youth, adults, nonprofits, business, government and congregations. Success in this segment will see less animosity, greater trust, and greater awareness of opportunities for individual growth as well as partnerships. Currently, there is a significant amount of animosity among many of the groups that is affecting areas such as employment and education.





Training will be a success with staff and others gaining capabilities and expanding knowledge bases. Learning of new â€œbest practicesâ€ can boost even the most best operation. In addition, training can help in evaluating existing projects and looking at future projects for improvement and/or implementation.





In all these segments, there will also be evaluation by users. The project sees constant feedback from those involved. For example, attendees at dialogue workshops will be asked for their opinions of the event and for suggestions. Success will be taking the existing regional â€œhuman capitalâ€ and growing and improving it to make a huge asset for the future.


","This project boosts social connectedness in the San Gabriel Valley, an area of Los Angeles County trailing in linkages. Away from many economic and government power centers, the region has been semiisolated among its own cities and regionally. Like in a body, an atrophied region is a problem for an area; this project looks to add muscle and flexibility to an underdeveloped part of the Greater Los Angeles body.





The project rapidly boosts communications capabilities for the existing Social Services program. The upgrades will greatly aid in communicating to diverse audiences and increases effectiveness through technology.  Adding PowerPoint capabilities and laptops for mobility will boost the effectiveness of project contacts.





It aims to help smooth the regional transition as more AsianPacific Islanders arrive along with newly arrived Latinos amid existing native and immigrant Latino populations. A faithbased organization that has begun building crosscultural bridges can be very successful in building the connections and trust needed for dialogue and growth. With the rapidly growing AsianPacific population throughout Los Angeles, this component can be a model for other areas as demographics change.





The projectâ€™s expansion of the LA Voice operation in the San Gabriel Valley creates many new opportunities for connectedness and growth. Rather than being the current outlier in the LA Voice/PICO network, the San Gabriel Valley organization will function as a hub, linked together, regionally, and statewide and nationally through the PICO networks. The strengthening of local links also benefits Greater Los Angeles by yielding a more involved and aware region.





The events in the project will promote connectedness among residents, businesses, and local governments. The area has a history of disconnectedness and at times, distrust, among the different sectors. These events are designed to provide new opportunities for residents and also rebuild communication links between government, the private sector, and citizens through contact.  The Los Angeles area gains when different parts of the community are in closer contact and cooperation.





Training will allow for ongoing returns in the future. Staff development will allow for more creativity and awareness in addressing needs. Training also creates opportunities for residents, in particular youth, to learn and ideally develop into solid community leaders. The formation of national connections will also benefit the region and Los Angeles with new ideas and opportunities for additional resources.





Social connectedness is a complex process. This project sees the challenges and uses a variety of activities to create opportunities for growth in a region that has lacked cohesiveness for years. The benefits for the region will also benefit Greater Los Angeles as the area becomes more integrated and serves as a model for other underserved areas. Improving the region betters all of Los Angeles. 


","The San Gabriel Valley is a much more socially connected area in 2050 than the 2010s. The region maintains its distinctiveness while now also being much more linked to the rest of Greater Los Angeles. This social connectedness has made for a more involved and aware populace, more efficient and transparent government, and for greater economic opportunity.





Thanks to an AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogue program that began in 2013, transitioning communities have been pleased with increased cooperation and reductions in tensions among residents.  The workshops and dialogue series has been copied throughout Los Angeles and California. Facilitators have trained new facilitators for locations throughout the valley to ensure discussions are ongoing and available as widely as possible.





L.A. Voice is now wellestablished in the San Gabriel Valley, reaching the San Bernardino County and Orange County lines.  The presence of an interfaith umbrella organization with national and state links to PICO has boosted the influence of area congregations.  Its area activity which had been solely in Baldwin Park is now a force all along the I10 corridor.  Previously neglected areas now have their voices heard in downtown Los Angeles and Sacramento, and within their own city government buildings. The local congregations have strongly bonded and now can address local and valleywide issues effectively. It is a substantial change from when the San Gabriel Valley was more of an isolated outpost for citizenry and interfaith congregational involvement.





The original social connectedness project helped create a great tradition of participatory events for the community.  The events are now eagerly anticipated annual highlights and held at multiple locations throughout the area. The higher education events create many opportunities for students to learn about college as well as gain financial aid, scholarships, and career planning. The community contact sessions have greatly improved relationships between local government, businesses, congregations, and nonprofits. Held at neutral sites, the sessions have opened many new lines of communications and greatly reduced distrust among the parties. The small group quarterly meetings have been replicated across the region giving participants a chance to meet others in a less formal environment. Citizenship fairs are also helping people move from legal residency to being United States citizens.





Training and staff development remains an important objective in 2050.  Greater public involvement in government and greater emphasis on intellectual property for employers meant additional learning becoming very valuable. The sharing of ideas has helped make involved people more efficient and effective. â€œLifetime learningâ€ is now more than a slogan or vague concept; it is reality.





Los Angeles is improved in 2050. While there will always be room for improvement, the changes started 37 years ago yielded a better society.

3102225,2013225,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/StepUp.html,Professional women Step Up to help underserved teen girls graduate, Education,"The goal of Step Upâ€™s Teen Empowerment Programs is for girls to graduate highschool confident, collegebound and careerready.  Our partner schools focus on the IQ: the reading, writing and arithmetic.  We focus on the EQ: the emotional and social skills they need to be successful and break the cycle of poverty. Built into our afterschool and Saturday programming are elements that address barriers to success such as a lack of parental involvement and support at home, the disconnect between the relevance of schoolwork to â€˜the real worldâ€™, negative peer pressure, lack of positive role models and lack of confidence. By taking a more holistic approach to the needs of our teen girls we are succeeding in partnership with schools where schools alone are failing.  Step Upâ€™s proven programs directly impact high school completion and dropout rates, college going rates and afterschool enrichment program participation. 


  


Our model is unique.  Girls are introduced to many different mentors and role models, not just one.  If a 9th grade girl is interested in becoming a doctor we can introduce her to one.  By 10th grade she may be thinking she wants to be a writer, a psychologist or a talk show host (or all three!).  Step Up has that covered.  Not only are we able to introduce our girls to the women who have the careers they are interested in, we introduce them to the companies as well.  They get to experience what it is like to be on the inside.  Providing a tangible, attainable vision for the future is a powerful tool keeping our girls in school and motivated to go to college. 





The professional women in our network are there all four years of highschool as classroom volunteers, hosts for field trips to their offices, providing internships and as mentors.  Our group mentoring model enables busy professional women who cannot commit to longterm mentoring relationships to leverage their personal and professional resources on behalf of the girls in our community in an accessible way.  This keeps the women, and their companies, engaged.  





9th and 10th Grade Confidence Building Program


9th and 10th grade classes are taught after school, oneday per week.  This curriculum offers 30 weeks of afterschool programming per grade and is designed to offer girls a solid foundation in life skills that will build their confidence. Created by internationally renowned confidence expert, Jess Weiner, the curriculum is jam packed with confidence boosting activities that also ground the students in career and college prep. Rooted in a multi disciplinary approach of team work, creative selfexpression, group exercises, and open dialogue  students use their real life experiences to explore issues of identity, action, vision, voice, and expression.  The 9th grade class focuses on Identity, Relationships and Voice.  The 10th grade class focuses on Vision, Action and Expression.  








11th Grade Career and College Exploration: Pathways to Professions


Pathways to Professions is Step Upâ€™s program aimed at jumpstarting high school girlsâ€™ careerexploration by providing invaluable firsthand exposure to a variety of industries and strong professional female role models. Step Up takes girls on field trips to companies and collaborates with each host to create dynamic, meaningful activities for students such as tours, roleplaying and panel discussions. The program aims to instill greater professional confidence in Step Up teens.  We leverage the reach of our professional women members to secure field trips to companies in a variety of industries from tech to publishing to banking to entertainment.  After the field trips, the girls are led through critical thinking exercises about what theyâ€™ve experienced with the help of our membermentors.  Students attend at least five field trips throughout the year and meet one Saturday per month. Saturday workshops cover multiple college preparation topics utilizing our professional women mentors.





12th Grade College and Career Preparation: Young Luminaries


This  program is aimed at supporting Step Up seniors as they apply to and make their transition to college.  Utilizing a group mentoring model, mentees and mentors attend a workshop one Saturday per month. In the fall semester the program focuses on support through the college application process. In the spring semester the program focuses on preparing students for summer internships at Step Up member companies.  Topics include resume writing, cover letters, professional etiquette, dressing for success, mock interviews and more.  





All students meeting Step Upâ€™s internship criteria are matched with a company for a six week paid summer internship.  These internships help girls from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities level the playing field by building their resume and exposing them to powerful networks of professionals that can provide recommendations to college and references for job opportunities. ","Step Up is proud that since beginning Teen Empowerment Programs in 2006 we have worked with nearly 700 underserved teen girls. For the past three years, 100% of Step Up seniors graduated from high school and were accepted to a college of their choice.





In addition, after participating in Step Up:


â€¢ 80% of students felt comfortable speaking in public, as compared to 60% before


â€¢ 75% felt they had  gained strong college and career role models


â€¢ 80% felt they understood the college admissions process, as compared to 60% before


â€¢ 85% felt informed about career options, as compared to 65% before


â€¢ 90% felt they understood and felt comfortable networking professionally, as compared to 50% before





Here are some stories of our girls that help bring these successes to life. 





Kayla, Class of 2013: â€œStep Up has shaped who I am today. Iâ€™ve learned to speak my mind and become an independent woman and a leader. After graduation, I plan to go on to college and continue my journey, to try out all of the great things that the world has to offer me. I would definitely encourage other girls to join Step Up. Step Up is a family you build, and it will only make you stronger.â€





Yosselin, Kenyan College Class of 2015: At 10 years old, Yosselin left El Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles and a troublesome period of her life began. She was skipping a lot of school and got involved with a gang. She turned a corner her freshman year of high school when she joined Step Up. Through Step Up, she was able to imagine a better life for herself for the first time. â€œMy best moment with Step Up has been interviewing Jane Wurwand, founder of Dermalogica, and having been able to visit her office and see her in action, running her company. This is when I realized that school was very important and I had to get serious. In 9th grade, Step Up not only became my escape, it became my new family. It has been the influence of so many strong successful women that have kept me working hard. It has been the Step Up college tours, internships, and my Step Up mentors that have helped me envision the future I know now I am capable of achieving. Through Step Up, I discovered my passion for writing and my potential to thrive in college.â€





Jaâ€™Nai, Gettysburg College Class of 2016 â€œBy participating in Step Up they taught me all about the business world and what I needed to do to be successful in it. In addition, it taught me exactly what my working style is and helped guide me in my search of what career I may want to pursue in the future by providing me with several exceptional mentors who are successful businesswoman. Through this program I was also able to obtain an internship at The JAR Group. I want to be a writer when I get older so my internship really helps me exercise my skills, since I spend most of my time finding content and sampling copies to go along with it. The Step Up program has given me the opportunity to have a voice.â€

","In a 2011 evaluation of our programs, we interviewed educators including administrators as well as academic subject teachers at our partner schools. 100% of those interviewed said that they would recommend Step Up programs to the girls in their classes.  Step Up teens exhibit qualities of inquisitiveness, independence, resilience and an ability to express themselves that make them stand out.  Educators shared with us that they have confidence that these girls will go on to college and be successful.





With pro bono support from Deloitte consulting and input from Step Up staff, our alumnae and school partners we developed 11 key outcomes (and indicators of behaviors which demonstrate progress toward those outcomes) that represent the confident, collegebound and careerready young women we want our Step Up teens to become.  Our curriculum (outlined above) is specifically designed to achieve these outcomes. 





Step Up measures programmatic success through various tools including number of students in the program, attendance, retention, the results of pre and post surveys administered to teen girls, and soliciting feedback from members and teen girls.  During the first three weeks of the program, Step Up administers presurveys to students.  The students take the same post survey at the end of the school year. The aim of these surveys is to measure the 11 key outcomes including the impact the program has had on the student and a change in overall habits.

","By yearend 2013 Step Up will serve at least 230 female students in grades nine through 12 in lowincome and underserved neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles who attend four of our partner Title 1 schools. Ninety percent of these students are eligible for the federal lunch program, meaning that the students and their families live at or below the federal poverty level, which is how Step Up defines lowincome. 





The ethnic makeup of our students is 2% AfricanAmerican, 7% Asian, 84% Latina, 4% multiracial and 2% Did Not Report. 





In addition:


â€¢        Over 85% of their primary home languages are not English. 


â€¢        Less than 50% of Step Up girls' parents or guardians have a high school diploma.


â€¢        98% of Step Up teens do not have a parent who attended college.





We are open to all girls at our partner schools.  There is no GPA requirement.  Often our girls are those at the middle to bottom of the pack who lack a cohesive social group.  But they have an inner drive that gets them in the door.  Once in Step Up weâ€™re able to ignite their potential.    


The impact of lowincome, minority youth graduating high school and attending college is documented well by statistics.  But what is not always captured is the ripple effect on the community.  Many of our girls have younger siblings.  They are acutely aware that their success models a new way of life for their family.  They know that they are trailblazing in their communities and that other kids are watching.  You canâ€™t be what you canâ€™t see.  Our professional women serve as role models for our girls.  The girls then serve as role models for their peer group and help set higher expectations for the next generation.  


","In 37 years another generation of young people will grow up here in Los Angeles.  Their communities will offer a stronger base of support, a highquality education system, stronger local economy and an engaged community that operates in a spirit of collaboration rather than competition.  Our public education system will be a source of pride that prepares kids to not only be ready to work and contribute to the economy, but will take a holistic view of youth as people with unlimited potential.  





Step Up envisions that the teen girls served by Step Upâ€™s network of professional women today will be serving as the mentors and role models for that next generation of Step Up teens.  A Step Up teen in 2050 will have a large national network of women and companies ready to open their doors for a mentorship experience, internship, a job.   Step Up women will be the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, Senators (or perhaps President of the United States), and influencers in all industries that believe in the power of community partnerships and investments in education and workforce development.  Step Up will be an attitude, not just an organization.

3102226,2013226,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/urbanair.html,URBAN AIR,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Urban Air is a project that transforms existing billboards into living, suspended bamboo gardens.  Embedded with intelligent technology, Urban Air is at once a provocative artwork and a crack in the urban skyline meant to surprise, inform, suggest, and create a visual respite for a road weary city.  With a donated billboard over one of LAâ€™s busiest freeways, the faÃ§ade of the billboard will be removed and replaced with architecturally integrated planters. Imagine being stuck in traffic, channel surfing on the radio, nothing but billboards with advertising on the skyline, and up pops a cluster of suspended living bamboo with water misters creating a visual cloud forest.  As per artist Stephen Glassman, Urban Air is an opportunity for people to â€œlook up, feel themselves as human, and conceive of what might be.â€  Beginning with one billboard, Urban Air intends to take an infrastructure that is only meant for modern advertising and commerce and create something accessible, inspiring, and altogether different  art for artâ€™s sake in a social, urban, and ecological context. Billboards right now exist mostly as visually opaque structures, like boarded up windows on the horizon. Urban Air transforms them into portalsâ€¦ Open windows that connect the viewers not only to the sky but also to their own sense of humanity, and ultimately and potentially, to other Urban Air billboards around the globe. Urban Air is about transforming structures often seen as urban blight into living metaphors. While Urban Air is primarily an artwork, each â€œgreenâ€ board will also be a â€œhotspotâ€ that measures and wirelessly communicates the comparative air quality of its internal microclimate relative to its surrounding area via the internet. We are reportedly exposed to up to 5,000 advertisements alone per day. And it has been said that the average city dweller is exposed to as much information in one day as the average Victorian was in a lifetime. When advertising is replaced with art, something that is purely visual and intended only to be looked at and experienced, we all win. Urban Air becomes a global node, an open space in the urban skyline intended to inspire and revitalize, at once an artwork, a symbol of, and an instrument for a green future.","Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the early 1990â€™s creating freeform bamboo installations for devastated urban sites in the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and Northridge Quake. Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant largescale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansasâ€™ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for largescale projects. Glassman is the recipient of numerous grants and awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA Cultural Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen Glassman Studioâ€™s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in 125 countries.  Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April. Since its publication internationally Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and inquiries from all over the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects in other cities... and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been the subject of collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University, Hampshire College, and other institutions.

Steve Reiss â€“ producer","The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm.  For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning inhouse conversations to explore the possibility of public building â€“ both art and architecture â€“ as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.





A technical success will be in the comparative monitoring of environmental qualities. The embedded environmental sensors will be streaming to the Urban Air website, and this data stream will be available to the public. Traffic to the website, both its quantity and quality, will be easily measured.





Success will also mean a measurable and discernable result in the culture of advertising within the city and beyond. This could include launching a potential collaboration with an advertising company or a discernable change in the aesthetics of some ad campaigns. Questions we will ask ourselves to measure success and evaluate our project will include: Did we affect a cultural change and inspire artistic and sustainable innovation in the advertising landscape? Can Urban Air inspire and begin to generate an advertising landscape that contributes to the city and serves people? Can we begin to imagine buildings and monuments that both clean the air and beautify the skyline?  As ultimately we would like to see Urban Air become a global initiative, perhaps in partnership with the Clinton C40 Initiative â€“ a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020, to generate interest and a connection with them would be an important and significant milestone. A successful Los Angeles â€œproof of conceptâ€ installation will open the door to all of these possibilities.





","Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is at once both vertical and horizontal.  Each culm is connected to and sustained by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall health of Los Angeles. 





Throughout history, art has been a vital sphere and critical element in the construct of communities. It has lived in the public realm in cave paintings, religious idols and shrines, piazzaâ€™s, monuments, and more. In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent.  





Urban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as businessâ€™s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity â€œfor no reasonâ€  art for artâ€™s sake  in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.





","The success of Urban Air in 2050 would look something like this:  A driver in LA would see a plethora of Urban Air, and Urban Air inspired constructions gracing the skyline. Bamboo and other living plant life would be integrated with art on the edifices  of the built environment. There would be Urban Air billboards by an array of different artists as part of the Clinton C40 Initiative â€“ a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020. These â€œgreenboardsâ€ would be catalysts for the way we think, act, educate, advertise, and integrate both the arts and greening of our cities. There would be additional Urban Air or Urban Air inspired billboards in other cities around the globe. Many edifices around LA, as well as elsewhere, would be exploring the use of art as an initiative in and of itself â€“ â€œart for arts sakeâ€ â€“ as well as potentially for integration in socially and aesthetically conscious ad campaigns.  The urban advertising landscape would be transformed to become another layer of serviceable urban infrastructure. Campaigns and companies themselves would be taking a different approach to the use of billboards, frequently integrating environmental sensors to measure air quality and otherwise concerning themselves not just with commerce but with providing service and both integrating and communicating aesthetics and sustainability. Universities and schools would regularly offer courses studying the use of both art and sustainable concerns in advertising and in platforms traditionally used for advertising. Commercial architectural projects would integrate Urban Air inspired billboards as part of their initial architectural planning and design, rather than as a post construction after thought. Conversations and dialogue around the way we experience and use art, aesthetics, sustainability, technology and commerce would have expanded and changed significantly in ways that major cities approach both the integration of arts, sustainability and economy throughout the world, so that he human experience of living in cities would be significantly improved."
3102227,2013227,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/streetcraft.html,Streetcraft: where street hustlers and tag bangers become creative economy entrepreneurs, Income & Employment,"July 13, 2012, The Los Angeles Times Business section: â€œRecession Erases 2.7 Million Youth Jobs, Widens Employment Gap.â€ If we didnâ€™t know this already, the headline of the article reminds us that youth unemployment is one of the largest social issues facing Los Angeles.  The current unemployment rate for 16 to 24yearolds is 16.5%  double the national 8.2%. More than 2 in 10 Latino youth are jobless, while 3 in 10 black youth are unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 





Most of usâ€”dogooders, funders, policy makersâ€”assume that the answer to youth unemployment is pretty straight forward: hope the economy gets better and provide kids training and education to help them get jobs when it does.  Streetcraft LA has a different approach to youth unemployment. We donâ€™t provide education and training to help young people get jobs. We provide education and training to empower youth to create their own jobs.  





Streetcraft empowers low income, at risk, and unemployed youth to improve their economic future through creative economy entrepreneurship. Donâ€™t get the wrong ideaâ€”we are not talking about lemonade stands or bake sales. We especially support youth in building creative sector small businesses in three categories: apparel, design, and creative services.   Why is this our strategy? Entrepreneurship and the creative economy are the future. The factories are closed, pensions are dead, and design studios are hiring freelancers. And this selfmade creative economy is a natural fit for our kids. Streetcraft kids have a lot of creative capacity, energy and hustle that is being misapplied as graffiti on, well, the side of your building. 





	How do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft LAâ€™s approach to launching creative microventures is a threestep model we call engage, partner, launch.  First, we engage youth misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti in a training and youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong program taught by wellknown street artists that empowers atrisk kids to see themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs. Crew functions not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth but functions as a Streetcraft human resources department sourcing the true talent that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's retail platform and design studio. 





Streetcraft LA operates a retail store in Los Angeles that showcases collaboratively designed and produced products and original apparel. Youth are formal partners in this social venture working with Streetcraftâ€™s lead designer to design custom furniture and original apparel such as hoodies, lids, and tshirts. Over a oneyear period, Streetcraft partners are exposed to the product design process including market research, sales, marketing and promotion, distribution platforms and retail management through both direct instruction by industry professionals and experiential learning.  Streetcraft partners are paid and also receive a percentage of all sales.  Streetcraft partners are also required and supported to complete high school and attend relevant higher education while enrolled.





After a year partnership, Streetcraft youth enter a process to launch their own creative micro enterprise. Youth can choose to enter a business planning process in one of three creative sectors: apparel, product design, and creative services.  Youth are paired with industry mentors and attend lectures on product development, market analysis, financing and organization development. At the conclusion of the year planning process, youth pitch their venture to a group of funders including banking partners such as Wells Fargo. 


","Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC). SBCC is a longstanding nonprofit organization that has been working to empower lowincome communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those dogooders that operates jobtraining programs to mitigate unemployment. The organizationâ€™s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth.  In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasnâ€™t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youthled micro ventures. 





Streetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation.  Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be redirected; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youthâ€™s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other communitybased networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%. 


","Streetcraft has a number of strategic partners. First, we will work the public and social sector to refer youth into the program. Future referral partners will be youth development community based organizations seeking career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the boys and girls club, home boys INC. and other CBOs. In addition, Streetcraft is currently partnering with the department of probation to receive a courtmandated placement for youth arrested for graffiti. ","Streetcraft has identified metrics to measure impact. To measure participant level economic impact, we will track participantsâ€™ earned income through product sales and micro venture profits. To measure personal and professional skill development we will administer pre/post assessments of basic skills, personal resiliency (University of Pennsylvania GRIT assessment) and professional skills (adobe certification). To measure community level impact, specifically decreases in graffiti, unemployment, and illicit street activities, we will work with local law enforcement to measure localized arrests for graffiti, calls for local graffiti â€œclean up,â€ arrests for drug dealing, and local unemployment rates collected by the State Department of Labor.  ","Only 25% of participants in most job training programs increase their annual wages (Jobs for the Future). Over 85% of Streetcraft youth triple their annual income. Within five years Streetcraft will spread this impact throughout Los Angeles county, becoming a countywide initiative with retail hubs in 20 locations working with over 20,000 young people a year. These retail hubs will house our engagement programming, apprenticeships, and provide a commercial marketplace for products designed by streetcraft artists as well as engage 1000 students a year. Our engagement programming will reduce graffiti and illicit street enterprises; the apprenticeship program will increase youthâ€™s annual income and provide concrete technical skills and work experience; and the micro venture program will increase the annual income of students by 50%. Finally, communities where streetcraft hubs are located will see youth unemployment decrease by 5%. ","Streetcraftâ€™s vision for success in 2050 is ambition: reduce youth unemployment through creative economy entrepreneurship by 25% in Los Angeles. Itâ€™s imperative that we achieve this. Youth unemployment has long term and systemic consequences. Unemployed youth face lifelong diminished economic and social opportunity. Communities with high youth unemployment have higher crime rates and have higher rates of birth out of wedlock. And a country with high youth unemployment suffers. The tax base erodes. Civic engagement and trust in government decreases. And entitlement programs become unsustainable. Itâ€™s not a pretty picture; it is an issue that we must solve now, and Streetcraft LA can lead the way."
3102228,2013228,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/giantharpproject.html,The Los Angeles Giant Harp Project,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"The LA Giant Harp Public Arts Partnership is a performance and public workshop residency  that brings free music, dance, and arts education to underserved communities. The 2050 Fund will enable the partnership of String Theory and Artists for Literacy to launch this project together in 2013. It will transform Los Angeles public space and architecture into sonic sculptures while celebrating the culture and diversity of this great city.


String Theory is an established LAbased performance group.  We design and build giant Harps that transform architecture into beautiful large scale instruments, which are visually and sonically spectacular. The LA Giant Harp Public Arts Partnership is an expansion of our regular 10year programming. In partnership with Artists for Literacy, this project is designed to embolden peopleâ€™s perspectives on where art lives, who owns it, and its powerful role in LA society now and in the future. It will foster a deeply needed connection between audience members, artists, and the communities in which we all live. We have chosen 3 locations in LA for our residency programs. Each residency has 3 components: a grassroots advocacy and outreach campaign that celebrates the arrival of our project and ensures that itâ€™s no secret and everyone feels free to participate;  free arts education workshops open to people of all ages and abilities (these yield works of art that are then integrated into the performance); sitespecific performances that integrate music, giant harps, dance, and audience engagement â€“ all in nontraditional spaces with free access. The criteria used for choosing each of the 3 locations is based the areaâ€™s need for public art and arts education, and the areaâ€™s architecture, specifically having historically significant structures that are currently underappreciated. The locations will be vetted by our advisory board, a board that draws from a unique blend of Los Angeles stakeholders including the Director, Government and Public Affairs of American Institute of Architects, LA Chapter, and a professor of Urban Planning at UCLA. These advisors will ensure that the buildings in our locations are deeply considered for their cultural and historical significance. 





Hereâ€™s a more specific breakdown:`


Outreach and Advocacy: 


Artists for Literacy is nonprofit org that has leveraged the power of music and dance to marshal diverse audiences around a common issue since 2000. The artistry of String Theory Productions enables us to create a forum for dynamic exchange around the connection between physical movement and personal wellbeing, and provide written and experiential learning tools that bring home memorable and meaningful connections between the place, the art, the audience and the issue. We have a commitment to make art and information accessible to people of all abilities and learning styles.


 


Community Workshops: 


We have run these workshops over the past 10 years all around Los Angeles. They embrace people of all ages and abilities.â€¨â€¨ These Art Circle workshops encourage people to draw, move and listen. The workshop is highly adaptable to all communities. Their performance pieces then become integrated in to the larger String Theory show.  We design these workshops to make a tangible connection between the community,  the space and the artists. By weaving parts of their story into ours, we break down the '4th wall' of communication between art and the audience. This fosters a profound inclusion that, when experienced by participants, can lead to a shift in their perceptions of where art fits into their lives.





Interactive Performances:  


String Theory is known for our signature giant Harp installations combined with music and dance.  We have performed all over LA, including Ford Amphitheater, The Van Nuys Bus Terminal, TED, The Broad Stage, The Getty Museum, MOCA, and The Grammyâ€™s, By utilizing our signature large scale sonic sculpture, String Theory transforms space into giant interactive instruments which become the landscape  in which our performances unfold. The creative work inspired by the Community Workshop participants is integrated into String Theoryâ€™s performance  including the participants themselves. 





The impact this project will have on the Arts & Culture indicator can be qualified through the cultural invigoration of specific communities that have had limited access to the arts, the celebration of culturally diverse communities coming together around art, the experience of art in unconventional spaces, increased awareness of the architecture of Los Angeles as it is a focal point in the Giant Harp installation and performance, increased health awareness as it relates to movement and dance, social connectedness (via our flash drive giveaways at the end of each performance that encourage a deeper look into their own community, the Giant Harp program and its participants), and free arts education from all three components of the project.

","In order to establish a baseline for measurement of this public arts initiative as it impacts each of the three locations, weâ€™ll look at the entire 2month residency â€“ all the touch points â€“ from who we reached during the outreach, to the participants of the workshops and to our reach during the performances.





First, the practical, tactical plan: We are giving away 100 flash drives at each of the final performances. These will be loaded with free arts and advocacy content and a URL key to more content. That URL will be an online survey that, once completed, will link the user to the free music and video downloads. These surveys will provide us with measurement tools i.e. answers to questions about The Giant Harp Project. These will be solicit quantitative data that includes audience attendance, workshop participation â€“ including detailed demographic breakdown of age, sex, ethnicity, and differentlyabled people. Weâ€™ll tally the number of private businesses engaged during outreach, and the number of community leaders engaged. 





For measurement that is more along the lines of qualitative assessments, weâ€™ll curate the art pieces generated from the workshops, and assess what personal expressions were tapped and released during the workshop process. Weâ€™ll measure the happiness index (measured in smiles and applause during workshops and performances), and the awareness of the significance of the architecturetosonic sculpture. Most people who live and work in their communities for several years never LOOK UP or AROUND to notice where they are. They move through years with heads down without an awareness of their environment or that environmentâ€™s history. Our project is designed reorient people to their own surrounding with a renewed appreciation for where art and performance fit into their lives.





Indeed, The Giant Harp residencies are designed to reposition art in the minds of those who experience it.  Weâ€™re not just talking about free access to art and how to evaluate the success of that. We aim to address and heal a larger gap that exists between what String Theory does and what the average person perceives as possible for them.  It takes a certain creative audacity to imagine and then position oneself on a journey to learn music and dance. It takes repeated exposure and familiarity with its pleasure and its power. Can we follow the life path of a person exposed to The Giant harp Project during one of our 3 residencies? No. But based on countless studies of more controlled subjects (i.e. Students in arts programs, art students testimonials about the first song or dance or poem that sparked their careers) we know that our project will have statistical success if we reach as many people as possible. This is why the public art partnership model for The Giant Harp project is such a stronger paradigm than booking single shows behind closed doors. We want to give back and change lives in the process.


","The Giant Harp Project is extremely unique.  It celebrates the temporal transformation of Los Angeles architecture, along with providing world class entertainment for free.  This project makes arts education accessible to all through workshops designed to engage multiple communities regardless of their age and physical or mental abilities.  Because String Theory has been celebrated by the finest venues of LA,  the city has already embraced the phenomena of the Giant Harp.  However, it has not been accessible to people without the means to buy tickets to the shows. Artists for Literacy and String Theory are excited to partner with Los Angeles in pioneering the effort to bridge the gap between artists and audience.   Without compromising artistic integrity, The Giant Harp Project, believes that the integration of work created by the public (via our workshops) can fortify the  actual performance of String Theory and honor the collaborative potential between artist and audience. At its core, this process is about engagement and discovery by both the artists and audiences at a profound level.





We also believe that the Giant Harp Project is coming at a time when LA is going through tremendous transformations at the community level. When choosing the 3 neighborhoods for our residencies in 2013, we have the opportunity to lend a hand to community stakeholders who are ushering in these changes. For example, the 6th Street Viaduct / Bridge project wonâ€™t begin until 2015. The Boyle heights communities impacted by the project have a 100 year history of the bridge to celebrate before itâ€™s torn down. Our Giant Harp Project can speak to that legacy on several levels and also serve a community that is in dire need of an arts infusion. Another location that is compelling to us is the 5 mile radius of the Magnolia Place Community Initiative. They are engaging more than 70 county, city and community organization to bring over 5000 families a comprehensive health and education overhaul. Their innovative coalition has room for a residency like ours to invigoration the publicâ€™s excitement and participation around this initiative. 





Our residency will include grassroots outreach into the communities before hand so that we donâ€™t just come and go without making a true and lasting impact.  As proof of concept, Artists for Literacy was funded by the California State Library in 2005 to do a similar project, not with art, but with the celebration of free literacy projects.  The advocacy campaign was very successful and those best practices will be used for this project.  





We also believe in the serendipity of being exposed to the arts and what transforms in people.  The Giant Harp Project is designed to inspire the inner artist in everybody.   Over the past 10 years, String Theory has proven this theory to be true.  Countless people who have participated in our workshops have embraced and accessed an artistic part of themselves.  


","We are sitting inside the canister of 2013 â€“ about to explode out into a futuretripping conversation about 2050 and how arts and culture are overflowing in the city of angles. The only sane way to see into the future is to look through a lens of optimism. Any other perspective corrodes any sense of present day purpose. So to us, arts and culture in 2050 inform government policy, education, innovation, and urban planning. "

In order to increase the employability and earning potential of our city, we need to help working college students succeed in class and raise graduation rates. STRIVERS.LA will give students tools to balance work and school hours that too often overlap, by involving employers in supporting their employeesâ€™ academic success. STRIVERS.LA is a web and mobilebased platform that will improve outcomes on both educational and employment indicators, helping to build a stronger Los Angeles through an educated workforce. STRIVERS.LA is partnering with the Los Angeles City College Foundation (LACCF) to bring innovative technology to lowincome working students in Los Angeles, creating a more robust economy and a betteremployed population.The Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) serves more than 250,000 students annually, and Los Angeles City College (LACC) serves 18,000 of them. Many of these largely lowincome students struggle to balance employment and school.  Nationally, 74% of students worked during the academic year, and 15 % are working fulltime.  Juggling work and school schedules leads to skipped classes, missed sleep, and even noshow exams. Research shows that every extra hour a student works above 10 hours/week lowers GPA by a measurable amount.  Sixty percent of community college students work more than 20 hours per week and 25% work more than 35 hours per week.  In California, fewer than 28% of students who begin a twoyear college program complete a degree within six years; for those studying part time, this percentage falls to less than 12%, in both cases significantly below the national average.  Los Angeles must improve its college completion rates in order to reach its economic potential.</p><p>Students often face calendar conflicts between work and school. 


Employers use sophisticated software to chop up the day and schedule shifts to meet business needs, not employees' academic goals. Employers may want to support their employeesâ€™ educational commitments, but lack the tools to do so.  STRIVERS.LA is a way to solve the problem using digital tools so students can request schedule adjustments to protect their lecture, study and exam times, while providing a platform that brings benefits for employers. </p>





<p>Many students lack the experience and personal savvy to negotiate work requirements. STRIVERS.LA provides student employees a comfortable digital tool  just formal enough to communicate class, exam, and homework routines effectively. Using a simple point and click interface, students enter their schedule information on the STRIVERS.LA website. They can then share the information with an employer via print, email, or link to their schedule at STRIVERS.LA. </p>





<p>STRIVERS.LA will move students toward earning â€œfamily supportive wagesâ€ by increasing their likelihood of maintaining a balance between work and school, facilitating completing their education, and thereby preparing them for middleclass employment and higherwage jobs. Current LACC students are primarily lowincome, with 70% receiving tuition waivers. STRIVERS.LA will affect multiple employmentrelated indicators when brought to scale throughout the region, helping students move from their current, parttime, low wage work into readiness for jobs that will help them sustain and grow their families. Preparing people for wellpaying jobs in technology, entertainment, tourism, and healthcare is an essential part of reducing income inequality.</p>





<p>When they use the STRIVERS  tool to communicate class, exam, and homework routines, students also agree to achieve, comply with basic standards of employee responsibility and to work hard in return for employer support. Students can choose to upload grades for employers to follow, and earn incentives for academic and work performance. We will both secure incentive donations from local businesses, as well as fund some targeted incentives through a partnership with the LACCF partnership.  </p>





<p>When employers sign on to support employees, they receive dividends in positive ratings, employee loyalty and retention, and social media kudos. We will work closely with employers located in proximity to LACC that employ large numbers of students, getting detailed input from store managers about the challenges and benefits of supporting their student workers.</p>





<p>By participating in STRIVERS.LA, both students and their managers can earn simple incentives for focusing needed attention on how to better balance work and school: gas cards, bus passes, textbook credits, as well as concert or movie tickets, coffee vouchers, and mormore. Employers support studentsâ€™ educational goals, and in return, students agree to do the right thing.  STRIVERS.LA: Everybody wins.</p>","<p>STRIVERS.LA is a new organization that will incorporate as a California B Corporation,  a new incorporation option designed for businesses with a social mission at their core. Cofounders are Angel Dean Lopez and Catherine Geanuracos. Catherine Geanuracos is the founder of New Economy Campaigns; she leverages technology and media to create global movements that respond to the most urgent social, environmental and political issues of our time. Angel Dean Lopez is a writer with extensive credentials in television and digital content production. In addition to his entertainment work, heâ€™s taught screenwriting at USC, UCLA, and Cal State Fullerton; his experiences teaching lowincome students were the inspiration for STRIVERS.LA.</p>


 


<p>STRIVERS.LA is being incubated by New Economy Campaigns, a digital strategy consultancy that has created national and global programs to leverage technology for social impact. Creating accessible ways to engage with causes that matter is the cornerstone of New Economy Campaignsâ€™ work. Whether the entry point is through a brand marketing initiative, a political campaign, or an open streets event, we offer pathways for consumers, constituents, and creators to have measurable and scalable impact. Weâ€™re rigorous in our assessment and evaluation, and only work on projects we believe can fulfill both marketing and causerelated objectives. The significant movements weâ€™ve been part of building, including MoveOn.org, Live Earth, and CicLAvia, connect masses of people through simple, fun actions and transform our cultural understanding. Recent successes include the creation and funding of â€œSpin the Vote,â€ the firstever national voter registration initiative for the dance music community, and the creation of the Paul Frank Art Supplies RoundUp, which generated close to $100K in cash and inkind donations to support childrenâ€™s art programming nationally. </p><p>Our partner, the Los Angeles City College Foundation, has had several recent programmatic achievements in supporting lowincome students. One example is the Foundation's support of recent U.S. combat veterans. According to the latest statistics collected by the College, approximately 600 current students have identified themselves as veteransand 370 of those students receive support from the Veterans Success Institute on the LACC campus. </p>





<p>LACC has great success moving students into wellpaid careers. Each of the Allied Health Programs (Nursing, Dental Technology, Radiologic Technology) boasts of impressive student test results, job placements and successful alumni. However, the path to success for many of these students is filled with financial hardship, personal sacrificeâ€”and even homelessness. In addition, these programs are more expensive to complete because they require additional tuition, expensive textbooks and supplies.  STRIVERS.LA will work with LACCF to target recruitment of students involved in each of these successful LACC programs. </p>","<p>STRIVERS.LA will partner with Los Angeles City College Foundation. LACCF is a 501(c)(3) corporation established in 1968 to increase the educational opportunities for students of LACC. LACCF will ensure access to LACC students during product development, piloting, and implementation phases, as well as assist with program evaluation.</p>





<p>In addition to our collaboration with LACCF, we are gathering partners to provide incentives to participating students and employers. Current partners include Saban Brands/Paul Frank Industries (providing youthfocused clothing and licensed products) and Electronic Music Alliance (providing concert tickets). We anticipate recruiting additional media, promotional, and incentive partners.</p>","<p>Through collaboration with our participating students, we will evaluate whether they report improvement on the following indicators:</p>





<p>â€¢	Class attendance</p>


<p>â€¢	Academic performance</p>


<p>â€¢	Job retention</p>


<p>â€¢	Graduation</p>


<p>â€¢	Income levels</p>





<p>Comparing the reports from participating students to those of the general student population will provide very clear overall metrics of success, as well as nearreal time snapshots of how our participants are doing. In addition to these performance metrics, we'll survey students and employers using our technology to determine which components are most helpful.</p>





<p>Our longterm success will be measured by the overall number of students and employers registering for and using the technology, and how well STRIVERS.LA retains and serves its users.  We wlll evaluate whether our technology is being adopted by students outside our original population at LACC, and see whether students across the region begin using it.  Over time, we hope to be able to show improvements in graduation rates and employability for lowincome students in the LA region.  </p>





<p>In addition, we hope that we can change the cultural norms for employers about their responsibility to support their student workers, communicating that the benefits of an educated workforce accrue to all of us.</p>","<p>The goals of STRIVERS.LA are to increase graduation rates, involve employers in their employeesâ€™ success, and help grow an educated, responsible workforce for the city of Los Angeles. This project will focus the new technology of STRIVERS.LA on students in Los Angeles, and by partnering with LACC we will engage some of the most ambitious, but also some of the lowestincome students in the LACCD. Serving residents of Los Angeles' Metro urban cluster, LACC's student population is among the most diverse in the nation. Of the Collegeâ€™s more than 18,000 students, 54% are immigrants to the United States and 50% are firstgeneration college students. Current LACC students are lowincome, with 70% receiving a Board of Governors waiver for tuition and 53% receiving some form of financial aid. A number of students are even homeless and hungry. Through our partnership with LACCF, we will be able to engage directly with this population, helping to bolster the employment that most students use to support their educational goals and improving their likelihood of completing an associateâ€™s degree or transferring to a fouryear school. By increasing graduation rates and educational achievement, STRIVERS.LA will increase the number of students who go on to earn â€œfamily supportive wages,"" improving the overall economic health of Los Angeles.  </p>





<p>In addition, this will be the first publicprivate technology partnership initiative for LACCF, beginning opportunities for innovation partnerships focused on the advancement and success of LAâ€™s college students.</p>





<p>Using LACC's student population as proof of concept, we hope to scale our efforts to reach all campuses in the LACCD and eventually have a presence in the Cal State and UC systems as well, improving key indicators for students and graduates throughout the Los Angeles region.</p>


","In 2050, if our initiative is successful, our community college system will have graduated tens of thousands more betterprepared, employed and employable students, ready to work in growth industries that will power the LA economy for the subsequent 50 years; healthcare, technology, hospitality and tourism. Weâ€™ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of lowincome working students who successfully complete college; weâ€™ll improve profitability for businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs, encouraging increased hiring and local investment.  Most importantly, weâ€™ll have created deep relationships between our community college system and local employers, developing a collaborative understanding of how supporting student workers will result in an improved economic environment for the entire community.  We'll create new norms for employers about how to interact with working students, and new expectations for students about how best to balance work and school. Success will mean lower income inequality, more families earning wages that support their needs, and a more flexible, bettereducated workforce able to adapt to changing economic conditions. "
3102230,2013230,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/sustainableworks.html,Sustainable Works Presents Dr. Keelingâ€™s Curve , Environmental Quality,"Our idea is to mount the production of Dr. Keelingâ€™s Curve, starring Mike Farrell, in 10 different venues in the greater Los Angeles area, with a focus on reaching underserved communities. Dr. Keelingâ€™s Curve is a play that both entertains and enlightens. It is the story of how one man came to discover the impact of carbon dioxide on our planetâ€™s health and wellbeing. What he learned of course, is that the rising levels of CO2 are the primary cause of global warming. As a side note, when Al Gore was an undergraduate at Harvard, it was Dr. Keelingâ€™s Curve that inspired his interest in the environment, which of course culminated in the academy award winning film An Inconvenient Truth.


Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, the senior scientist as NRDC, said the following in an interview with the New York Times in October 2012: â€œWe are dealing with a gigantic problem and there is no one large undertaking that any individual or business or country can do to solve our ecological problems. It will take billions of people making highly intelligent choices.â€


So how do you get billions of people to make highly intelligent choices? By educating them; first hundreds, then thousands, than hundreds of thousands, then millions, and eventually those millions add up to billions. 


The power of live theater, done well, can be transformative. When I attended a performance of Dr. Keelingâ€™s Curve at The Blank Theater, I knew Sustainable Works needed to bring this play to as wide an audience in Los Angeles as possible. By doing so, we would be educating thousands of people on the issue of global warming in a way that would motivate them to do something about the problem.  








","Since 1998, Sustainable Works has educated over 4,000 residents and instructed over 5,500 community college students on issues of sustainability.  We have also advised over 400 businesses so they now operate more sustainably.  Specifically, they conserve water and energy, produce less waste, use less toxic chemicals and purchase greener products.",The Blank Theater,"We will gauge success in 3 ways: 


1. By the strength of performance attendance  


2. By audience response to a brief post performance questionnaire


3. By contributions collected for Sustainable Works. Admission to the performances is free.  However, following the example set by Panera Bread in some of their restaurants, attendees at our plays will be encouraged to pay whatever they feel comfortable paying.


","By telling the story of climate change in the form of a provocative play, starring a well known and respected actor, we will reach thousands of people who might otherwise not have been exposed to this crucial information.   ",In our vision for the year 2050 Los Angeles would be the greenest city in the country and one of the greenest cities on the planet
3102231,2013231,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/swipesforthehomeless.html,Students Working Together to Combat Homelessness and Reduce Food Waste on Campus, Housing,"In September 2009, â€œSwipes for the Homelessâ€ was established as an official university student organization at UCLA in order to help alleviate the destitution of the neighboring homeless community, specifically the growing homeless student population. 





Having seen oncampus students collect hot meals for the needy in past years, UCLA students Thach Nguyen and Bryan Pezeshki came up with a brilliant idea. They set out to create a partnership between the multiple campus departments to fully institutionalize a program that would allow the impact and influence of their idea to grow to its full potential. 





What exactly was this idea? Oncampus residents with meal plans that allow them to roll over unused meals from week to week, tend to accrue many unused meals, or â€œswipesâ€, by the end of each academic quarter. At the end of the quarter, these students can donate their unused meal swipes, which would otherwise go to waste, to Swipes for the Homeless. These swipes are then transferred into nonperishable goods and then taken to homeless shelters, homeless living on the streets, and homeless and hungry students on campus. In addition, many other subprojects target wasted food in the residential dining halls, fastfood eateries on campus, and community businesses in order to salvage that food for those less fortunate on a daily basis. The organization has collected over 30,000 meals to date, with a record of 7,421 meals this past university quarter 





The simplicity and effectiveness of this idea quickly led to its expansion onto numerous college campuses worldwide, amongst those being USC, UC Berkeley and University of Paris in France. In April of 2012, after a nationwide search and vetting of thousands of applicants, President Obama recognized our organization as one of five â€œChampions of Change,â€ personally inviting our group to the White House to honor us for our impact on the community. â€œSwipesâ€ has since become a statecertified 501(c)3 non profit organization with the aim of spreading its impact on to every campus in the world.





Although our main indicator would be â€œhousing,â€ Swipes for the Homeless affects several other indicators on many different levels. For example, our dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising young peopleâ€™s awareness of homelessness and hunger through education and outreach. Through this we hope to facilitate the spirit of giving and volunteerism, a crucial component of social connectedness. Swipes for the Homeless is also environmentallyfocused because it helps University campuses reduce their food waste. We understand that all indicators and social issues are interconnected, and that improving one area would correlate with an improvement in another indicator. 


","Since its humble beginnings, Swipes for the Homeless has donated over 35,000 pounds of food just in Los Angeles and thousands of additional meals around the nation. In fact, we have recorded a whopping number of 57,268 pounds of food donated as of January 2013! All of this couldnâ€™t have been done without our dedicated university chapters. We are continuing to spread our mission to university campuses, and additional students from over 30 universities have recently reached out to us to establish a chapter on their perspective campuses. Swipes for the Homeless has been featured in many publications and media outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, MTV, GOOD Magazine, Forbes, UCLA Magazine, and many others. Our biggest (and most exciting) achievement to date was when our organization was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Campus Champion of Change in 2011. The Champions of Change challenge was launched by the White House to honor five young leaders for outstanding leadership on their college campuses. After reviewing a record number of entries, fifteen Challenge finalists were announced and the public chose the top five projects they think best embody the Presidentâ€™s goal to win the future. Swipes for the Homeless was voted as one of the top five! Our members were honored with the opportunity to travel to the White House and personally meet Obama for a press conference with the other winners. In 2012, Swipes for the Homeless was also recognized as Most Influential College Organization at the 2012 Stay Classy Awards, the largest philanthropic recognition ceremony in America. From these various recognitions, we have been blessed with the opportunity to bring this important cause to further light on the national media scale, and would like to thank all of our supporters who have been with us every step of the way. ","Swipes for the Homeless has engaged with several organizations and companies that span across a wide range of industries. For example, we have conducted talks with companies such as TowelSafe (a cuttingedge company with a program that allows people to donate one pocketed towel with a toiletry kit to a local homeless individual) and KNOclothing (a sociallyminded business that donates an article of clothing to those in need for every purchase). Our talks have focused on partnership possibilities and ways that we can support each other. Recently, Swipes for the Homeless collaborated with Ebay's Giving Works program. Through this program,customers can donate to a nonprofit or charity of their choice, simply by buying or selling an item.","The meaning of success for us is multifaceted. If the past three years have served as any evidence, we anticipate exponential growth and impact. From a pragmatic standpoint, we want to streamline our relationships with our campus chapters by providing more communication, training, and development. Our executive team has spent last summer redefining our vision for the organization and made plans to establish stronger ties with our campus communities. Shortterm strategies include institutionalizing quarterly video conferences and developing grantwriting/campus development kits; our longterm strategies include providing financial and webbased support for our individual chapters. These new tools aim to elevate resources available athand for our campus leaders. From a highlevel vision, our hope and goal is to maximize the impact of our organization by being more intentional about our programming initiatives. 





We, of course, want to maintain our growth and expansion beyond the 12 campuses we currently exist in. But rather than simply focusing on the quantity of food in which collect, we want to establish partnerships with organizations and professionals from the medical field who will work with us to identify the most nourishing and nutritious foods. We hope to use our donated foods to not only alleviate hunger but to find opportunities to address deep malnutrition and the issues associated with it. Furthermore, as our organization continues to grow and our vision mature, we want to look at targeted demographics with special needs rather than just adopting a blind, homogenous view of the homeless population. Special communities, such as LGBT youth, experience unique circumstances that make them the most atrisk population and our goal is to develop programming that will address these issues. Itâ€™s an incredibly exciting time in the history of organization as we are transforming our structure both internally and externally. As Swipes for the Homeless continues to grow, we are rethinking our strategy by both broadening our scope and the campuses we are able to reach, as well as refining our approach to maximize the quality of our impact.


","According to a 2012 article in the Huffington Post, â€œmore than 51,000 homeless people live in Los Angeles County, from Antelope Valley to the South Bay, with doubledigit percentage increases in the number of families, seniors and veterans over last year.â€ The LA2050 website quotes that â€œLos Angeles is considered the â€˜homeless capital of the country.â€™â€ Swipes for the Homeless is especially prominent and beneficial in Los Angeles because of two main reasons. Firstly, the statistics tell all â€“ there is a strong need for support and services for the local homeless population. With such a large homeless population and shelters lacking in resources, every act of giving and every helping hand counts. We hope that Swipes for the Homeless has helped â€“ and will continue to â€“ alleviate the strain on homeless shelters and missions in Los Angeles. In addition, Swipes for the Homeless has two very strong chapters that are based in Los Angeles â€“ UCLA and USC. UCLA is our oldest and most established chapter, with a fully selfsufficient and independent team that runs smoothly every quarter. USC is a relatively newer chapter, but during their first donation drive in Fall 2012 the Trojans managed to collect 2,300 pounds of food! Despite the friendly rivalry between both schools, here is a wonderful example where students from rival universities can work together for a greater cause. Combined, our UCLA and USC chapters prove to be a strong force that is united in its mission to fight homelessness in Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.","Our dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to alleviate hunger while raising young peopleâ€™s awareness of homelessness and hunger through education and outreach. Because of our commitment to fighting homelessness, our vision for the year 2050 would be a large national decrease in (if not a complete eradication of) homelessness, especially amongst the student population. We hope that through our advocacy and outreach on this issue, we can influence and mobilize youth for generations to come. In addition, we would also like to see a reduction in food waste across campus dining halls on a national level. The future of the environment is already in jeopardy, and it is frightening to think what our cities will look like in the year 2050 if we donâ€™t take action to reduce waste and implement sustainable measures now. Ultimately, we want to advocate for the idea that each individual person, each small act of kindness or helping hand can make a difference in the lives of others. "
3102232,2013232,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/takebackthegrid.html,Renewable Financing for Renewable Energy, Environmental Quality,"Take Back the Grid's mission is to massively expand the financing for, and adoption of, renewable energy projects. <p>








The idea is to create an evergreen fund for renewable energy, where every investment in solar creates a revenue stream that can be reinvested in more solar. It changes the equation from savings to earnings. In this model, every $1 dollar invested in renewables creates a revenue stream worth $3 to $4 over time. By reinvesting these revenues into even more solar projects, our initial investment compounds and grows exponentially. With even a moderate return of 10% (typical for an average solar project), compounding means that you'll double your solar capacity in just 7 years, triple within 11 years, and by 2050 our initial investment will have multiplied 34 times! For creating local jobs, reducing energy costs, and combatting climate change, there's no better way than to make investments today that renew themselves tomorrow. And all we have to do is start. When we divert money that we already spend away from dirty energy and toward clean energy, the compounding nature of the evergreen fund takes care of the rest. <p>








This is a modification of the existing thirdpartyownership/solar leasing model that has drastically increased solar adoption over the last 5 years, in which a financing company owns the solar panels on your roof, and you pay them a fixed monthly payment for the energy generated by the solar panels. This solar lease is a 20year contract, where the investor gets paid back over time and allows the customer to ""go solar"" without the upfront cost while locking in savings relative to current electrical rates. <p>








My innovation is in the fund behind this deal. Currently, solar leases are financed by big banks, so all of the incentives, credits, and lease payments intended to fund solar energy just go back to the banks. That is fine, but there's a more powerful way. By backing these solar leases with an evergreen fund, we directly reinvest a project's revenues back into financing more solar. Once a project has duplicated itself, its revenues can return to investors while the ""new"" project starts duplicating itself. This way, every project we build will finance another project. Every dollar spent on solar energy is an investment in more solar capacity. It compounds our effort, insuring savings for our customers and that more solar will be built than with any other model for renewable energy financing. <p>





In the case of the LA2050 grant, there is no investor to repay, only tons of solar to build, so all lease profits will be reinvested for the lifetime of the project.","Working with Dan Rosen, Billy Parish, and Arthur Coulston at SolarMosaic (www.joinmosaic.com) to develop the financial model for the ""Oakland Solar Mosaic"" was an incredible time for me. Through that effort, $400,000 was raised from ""the crowd"" to develop solar projects for nonprofits in Oakland, CA. The support we had in developing a crowdfunding model for solar finance was absolutely humbling, and to see what happens when a good idea's time has come was inspiring. ",Progressive Power Group of Garden Grove is my installer of choice and Ivan La FrinereSandoval of Solar First has provided the tax equity investment that covers the 30% Federal Tax Credit portion of the project (a critical piece of any solar lease/thirdpartyownership arrangement). Matt Moses of Mimeos Sustainability has shown me the ropes of getting solar built while leading a customerfirst enterprise.,"Success will be measured by the existence of solar projects financing more solar. Success is where ALL of your utility payments go to building more clean energy for our city, not just a couple cents per bill by checking the ""green energy"" box. <p>





Specifically, we will be able to measure our success in:<br>





1) Total Solar Capacity deployed (first year and every successive year)<br>





2) Total Savings to customers<br>





3) Annual revenue for reinvestment<br>





4) Total carbon emissions offset (megatons/year)<br><p>





Since $100,000 spent purchasing solar projects from typical developers would only deploy about 25kW of capacity, and we'll build nearly 3x that in the first year, I'm confident the metrics for success will be significant.","It will create an enduring investment in renewable energy and prove a new model for solar leasing that can scale across the city and country.<p>





Specifically, it will install 70kW of solar energy in the first year (710 households worth), and will create a revenue stream that will finance another 9kW of solar the following year. Because the investment is compounded and the total revenue grows each year, the impact compounds as well. 9kW in the first year, 10.2kW the second, 11.5kW in the third, etc. Within 6 years, the initial 70kW of solar built will have doubled to 140kW of clean energy that is saving customers on their utilities while producing financing for more projects. <p>





It's a virtuous cycle where the more good we do, the more good we can do. We turn our customer's utility bill into an engine for financing renewable energy on their neighbor's roof, and that neighbor's roof, until all of the roofs are full with clean, efficient power plants. The larger we start, the sooner we can reach our goal of removing fossil fuels from our electrical grid.


","In 2050, we have a utility system owned by the community, powering the community with 100% renewable energy. We no longer have need for fossil fuels and are running our cities and transportation systems completely on renewable sources of energy.<p>


If we let 37 years worth of compounding interest apply to our investments today, it won't take long until we've kicked the carbon habit!"
3102233,2013233,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TEACHFORAMERICA-LA.html,Enlisting our cityâ€™s most promising future leaders in the fight for educational equity, Education,"Our vision of Los Angeles in 2050 is a city where every child, regardless of what zip code they live in or the where they were born, has the opportunity to obtain an excellent education. At Teach For America (TFA) we believe the key to an exemplary education system in Los Angeles is leadership and we are working to build a team of leaders committed to creating change.<BR>


<BR>


There are three parts to our mission:<BR>


<BR>


1)  We recruit diverse recent college graduates and professionals with demonstrated leadership ability to teach for a minimum of two years in lowincome public schools. <BR>


<BR>


2) We provide intensive training and support for these teachers, called corps members, so they can have an immediate positive effect on student achievement and deepen their own understanding of what it takes to end educational inequity.<BR>


<BR>


3) We foster their leadership as alumni who, deeply affected by their experience in the classroom, work at every level of education and across other sectors to advocate for the interests of students.<BR>


<BR>


Teach For America has been working alongside communities in Los Angeles since the organizationâ€™s founding in 1990. Since then our corps members have taught 440,000 Los Angeles students. This year approximately 300 corps members are teaching more than 20,000 students every day in and around Los Angeles. <BR>


<BR>


As a result of our 23 years in this city, our alumni network includes more than 1,600 individuals, including 50 principals and school leaders, 13 school system leaders (who supervise clusters of school leaders), and 11 elected officials. In concert with our communities, our alumni have worked to establish whole schools of excellence, which serve as proof points throughout our city of what is possible for our children. Our more mature alumni now have the experience and credibility to lead schools and school system and drive policy for the public and private sectors. The two decades invested in developing our people as leaders are now paying off. We believe the benefit of this investment will ripple throughout our city over the next 20 years when todayâ€™s corps members are teaching in classrooms, leading schools and businesses, serving on city councils, crafting legislation, and advocating for our students.





","Over more than two decades in Los Angeles, our corps members, alumni, and their students have proven what is possible in classrooms and in schools throughout our city. Some exciting recent developments include: <BR>


<BR>


1)	A recent report released by the Harvard Strategic Data Project found that Teach For America Los Angeles teachers and Career Ladder teachers (a pathway for LAUSD paraprofessionals such as teacherâ€™s aides) are more effective than other novice teachers within LAUSD at promoting student learning in math. The effect of having a TFA teacher corresponded to a month and half, or nearly 20 percent, of additional learning, compared to other teachers. <BR>


<BR>


2)	This yearâ€™s Los Angeles corps represents diversity of background (twothirds identify as people of color); diversity of experience (30 percent came from graduate school or professional backgrounds); and diversity of teacher placement (more than onethird teach math or science). <BR>


<BR>


3)	As noted above, alumnus Tommy Chang (corps year â€™97) was appointed by Superintendent John Deasy to be one of five local superintendents in LAUSD. As superintendent of intensive support and innovation, Tommy oversees 130 schools and 130,000 students, including a majority of chronically failing schools in the district. He and his team work aggressively to transform outcomes for students across these schools. Other notable TFA alumni in the district include Drew Furedi (corps year â€™93) who is spearheading the new teacher evaluation pilot in his role as the executive director of talent management for LAUSD. Drewâ€™s team includes at least six other TFA alums. <BR>


<BR>


4)	One hundred percent of Camino Nuevo schools K12 principals are TFA alumni, as is the charter networkâ€™s chief executive officer, Ana Ponce (corps year â€™91). Ana was also named one of the Worldâ€™s Seven Most Powerful Educators in Forbes magazine this year. <BR>


<BR>


5)	In the KIPP LA network, six out of seven schools currently operating are run by TFA alumni. Alumna Angella Martinez (corps year â€™01) led KIPP LA Prep to become the topperforming middle school in LAUSD and now supports all KIPP schools in Los Angeles as their chief academic officer. Other alumni continue to increase their leadership presence in charter organizations like the Alliance CollegeReady Public Schools, PUC, and Inner City Education Foundation (ICEF), as site principals, assistant principals, and schoolbased instructional leaders. Alumna Allison Bajracharya (corps year â€™00) supports all charter partners as vice president of regional advocacy at the California Charter Schools Association. <BR>


<BR>


With the striking evidence of what our corps members and alumni are capable of we can only imagine what our leaders will accomplish toward our goal of educational equity over the coming decades.


","We partner with more than 100 placement schools and administrators in Compton, Hawthorne, Huntington Park, Inglewood, Lennox, Long Beach, Los Angeles, and South Gate. We work with 11 leading charter management organizations, including The Alliance for CollegeReady Public Schools, the Inner City Education Foundation (ICEF), Green Dot, KIPP, Aspire, Bright Star, Camino Nuevo, Partnerships to Uplift Communities (PUC), Wiseburn Charter Schools, Para Los NiÃ±os, and Value Charter Schools. Our 2 university partners are Loyola Marymount University (our teacher preparation institute and corps member credentialing) and Cal State Northridge (an administrative credentialing program for a career in school leadership for our alumni).","We have identified three priorities to help us achieve our vision for Los Angeles: <BR>


<BR>


1) Cultivate more talent & leadership in Los Angeles: Educational inequity is a massive problem, and we need to dramatically increase the number of people in Los Angeles working together to solve it. This year, we aim to support up to 175 new corps members in Los Angeles, who will begin teaching in the 201314 school year. To meet the needs of our school partners, the majority of these corps members will teach science, math or special education. <BR>


<BR>


2) Increase student learning & support corps member professional development:  Once in Los Angeles, our teachers must be prepared to provide highquality instruction and be equipped to address the additional challenges children growing up in poverty often face. In short, they need to be great at what they do. Each year we aim to increase the positive effect our corps members have on student achievement by using data from previous years to improve our model. Progress is determined through a combination of standardized test grades, endofyear reports from school districts, and inclass evaluations. It is tracked throughout the year. We measure each corps memberâ€™s progress against an ambitious benchmarkâ€”the score a highperforming teacher would accomplish, which accounts for subject, grade, and student starting point. By 2015, we aim for the average growth of students to be at the top 75th percentile of students across the country. <BR>


<BR>


To achieve ambitious results in the classroom, teachers need support. All corps members attend our intensive summer training institute and regular professional development trainings, have Teach For America coaches, share resources and best practices, and enroll in contentspecific credential and/or Masters programs. Helping their students succeed and feeling supported in their efforts ensures that our corps members complete our program with the conviction to continue the fight for educational equity for Los Angeles students over the long run.  <BR>


<BR>


3) Foster alumni leadership: Filling highneed classrooms with passionate, highachieving individuals who will do whatever it takes to help their students succeed is a critical element of our approachâ€”but itâ€™s not enough. Our city needs people in every sector who are passionate about solving educational inequity. In addition to our 50 school leaders (defined as at or above the principal level), our shortterm goal is for 10 alumni to become new school leaders by September 2013 and for a total of 16 alumni to become new school leaders by September 2014. <BR>


<BR>


We support alumni by identifying job openings and offering resume and interview coaching, and helping to create pathways to pursue career advancement. ","Only 10 percent of the individuals who join TFA report that teaching is one of their top career options. Yet 93 percent of our programâ€™s alumni report they support TFAâ€™s mission through career, philanthropy, volunteerism, or graduate study and 63 percent still work or study fulltime in education. Our project will develop the next generation of city leaders in Los Angeles who are deeply committed to our students and a stronger education system.<BR>


<BR>


We have seen the benefits our corps members bring to their individual classrooms, to entire school buildings, and to school systems: <BR>


<BR>


<b>Teacher Leadership</b><BR>


Los Angeles native Beatrice Viramontes (corps year â€˜08) taught math and science at John Leichty Middle School just a few miles west of downtown. All of her Algebra students started the year at varying levels behind grade level. By the end of the year, 70 percent of her students were on or above grade level. Algebra is frequently referred to as a gatekeeper subject because it is the first in a series of higherlevel math classes needed to succeed in college and life. Beatriceâ€™s class was a stepping stone for even greater accomplishments; so far, her students have been accepted at Emerson College, Northwestern University, San Francisco State, and the University of California Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and San Diego. Beatrice now coaches and supports groups of corps members working to help future college applicants make their dreams a reality. <BR>





<b>School Leadership</b> <BR>


Many of our alumni become principals to expand their impact from individual classrooms to entire school sites. Six of our 50 alumni school leaders are at the helm of California Distinguished Elementary Schools, including Frank Lozier (corps year â€™00), the principal of Laurel Street Elementary in the Compton Unified School District. Laurel Street achieved a remarkable 927 Academic Performance Index (API) score last year. (API scores range from 200 to 1000, and the statewide target is 800.) <BR>





<b>School System Leadership</b><BR>


With more than two decades in Los Angeles, we also have 13 alumni impacting whole school systems, including: 


â€¢        Tommy Chang (corps year â€™97), Superintendent of Intensive Support and Innovation, who oversees 130 schools and 130,000 students, including a majority of chronically failing schools in the LAUSD;


â€¢        Gordon Gibbings (corps year â€™99) and Chad Soleo (corps year â€™01), both Cluster Directors overseeing groups of principals for Green Dot Public Schools; and


â€¢        Angella Martinez (corps year â€™01), Chief Academic Officer for KIPP LA schools.  <BR>


<BR>


This spring, we will welcome the next group of new teachers, who we will train and support over the coming two years. These corps members may be the next Beatrice Viramontes, Frank Lozier or Tommy Chang, opening doors for thousands more Los Angeles students who deserve an excellent education. 


","If we succeed by 2050, we would have put ourselves out of business. It is our hope that over the next few decades, the academic success we see in individual classrooms and in our cityâ€™s most successful public schools will be a reality for every Angeleno. <BR>


<BR>


If we continue to grow at our current pace, by 2050 more than 7,000 Teach For America alumni would live in Los Angeles. Our corps members and alumni would teach nearly 5,000 students every day. Five million students would have been taught by our people over the course of our history. If, together as a city, we succeed at infusing enough leadership into our system to move Los Angeles to a â€œtipping pointâ€ where the talent, innovation and policies exist to ensure that all children in Los Angeles have access to a highquality education, our mission will be achieved.

3102234,2013234,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/artmageddon.html,ARTmageddon,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Make ARTmageddon an annual celebration of the arts in Los Angeles! 





Under the motto ""Less Car. More Art."", hundreds of L.A.based artists and arts organizations united last fall for ARTmageddon, a twoday citywide celebration of the prolific and inspiring art happening all over Los Angeles. At the center of ARTmageddon was a new website which allowed the idea live and be shared digitally (www.ARTmageddonLA.com). It featured 250+ listings for performances, concerts, screenings, literary events, and exhibitions Angelenos could walk, bike and metro.


ARTmageddon began as an simple idea inspired by Metro's Carmageddon II, with almost all the previous support being donated time from dedicated volunteers, but it quickly became the largest citywide art party Los Angeles had ever seen. 





ARTmageddon connects local artists to each other, encouraging collaborating between artists and arts organizations with each other, and with other local businesses such as restaurants, bookstores, and retailers. This central hub also supplies artists and arts organizations with the tools and know how to start going door to door in their own neighborhoods, creating a structure to offer the opportunity for artists to get to know their neighbors face to face.





Expansions to enhance ARTmageddon in 2013 include printed materials including a detailed printed map and decals for participating locations. A series of hosted talks and art movies before and during event. Social media contests with instagram. A mobile app creation than can continue to be updated so that the program can live beyond the live event. We would like to create an affiliate program as well for the neighboring cities including Long Beach, Pomona and Claremont and the Orange and Venture counties. ","Our brightest achievement was our central mission at the founding of ARTmageddon, to redefine Carmageddon II as ARTmageddon. And it worked! We brought together hundreds of artists and arts organizations including LA's major arts organizations, and even the mayor's office joined in on the action. We were featured in local, national, and international press including USA Today, Newsweek, LA Times, NBC, Huffington Post, and dozens more, including neighborhood and city newspapers and newsletters from most LA District offices. We even noticed on Twitter and Facebook that people outside of Los Angeles (even in China!) were talking about ""Less Car. More Art."" and expressing their desire to be in LA for ARTmageddon weekend.  enjoying ARTmageddon weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people encountered our simple idea, and many of them took the opportunity to walk, bike and metro to art nearby!","ARTmageddon was created by artists Diana Wyenn (Beyond the Usual) and Ezra LeBank (Curbside), in partnership with Metro, Department of Cultural Affairs, LA Stage Alliance, ForYourArt, the Los Angeles Downtown Arts District (LADAD) and Experience LA, and in collaboration with thousands of artists and more than 250 arts and cultural partners including LACMA, MOCA, the Fowler, and more! A full list can be found here: http://www.artmageddonla.com/thankyou/





For our next iteration, we will once again partner with these folks, as well as with Team Friday, and work to expand our reach to include even more artists, arts organizations, community partners, and media sponsors. 


","Evaluation is key for growth and we definitely understand that. As 2012 was the first year we were able to measure success through artist and institutional participation and media coverage. We are also meeting with key participants and contributors to analyze what was successful last year on the ground level.  Although these will continue to be important factors of determining the future success of ARTmageddon, we will be measuring success in three phases. Phase one  will include measuring the interactions from all forms of participants including artists, institutions, consumers and media on  digital platforms. Phase two will be measuring the call to action by assessing the participation and media coverage during the event.Phase three will be any post event coverage and digital interaction. 





Covering the success of ARTmageddon in three phases will allow us to react and change anything necessary to ensure success going forward. ","One of the major and critical benefits of ARTmageddon centers on cultivating neighborhoods and their connection to artists. Los Angeles is a city defined by its freeways. And yet, there are dozens of beautiful, culturally and historically rich neighborhoods, that while tourists travel from hundreds and thousands of miles away to experience, we often aren't even aware of what is waiting only steps from our front door. Here at ARTmageddon, we believe Los Angeles and Art should be defined by its neighborhoods.





A project of this magnitude benefits not only the arts in a direct and literal way but on levels that span across economic and neighborhood development. 





And that's why we shout our rallying cry! ""Less Car! More ART!""


","Success would mean making ARTmageddon an annual Los Angeles celebration of local art, bringing together each of Los Angeles' beautiful neighborhoods. It would spread to every arts organization in Los Angeles, and because a holidaylike atmosphere one weekend a year that spreads through the rest of the year through the connections, collaborations, and awareness raised during ARTmageddon. It would spread to a national ""local movement,"" where headquarters in every major cultural hub join together for one weekend a year from cities from coast to coast join together in the biggest art party in the world!"
3102235,2013235,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/thankyouforcoming.html,We are an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles. ,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Thank You For Coming is an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles that opened its doors to the public in December 2012. We are a collectivelyrun and permitted restaurant  this means that our crew rotates through volunteer and artist residency programs which offer people with varying interests and skills opportunities to cook for the public, play with a space, and experiment accordingly. By presenting these opportunities and their resulting ideas in a permanent and public restaurant space, we are able to provide accessible, unexpected, and participatory cultural experiences for Los Angeles residents. 





By intentionally operating Thank You For Coming as a place that draws ambiguous lines between art space, community center and food facility, we want to demonstrate that arts and cultural vitality can thrive in everyday spaces and via the endeavors of everyday life  in our case, as it pertains to the basic acts of eating and feeding and through the universal medium of food. This school of thought can help move Los Angeles towards providing access to arts for all because its lowbarrier process invites the populace to create and participate in its own creative experiences, thereby encouraging the proliferation of autonomous cultural production in countless pockets of the city, whether occurring in living rooms, neighborhoods, restaurants, libraries, parks or parking lots. 





Thank You For Coming was conceived and built on dreams, lots of people power, and a highlyinvolved collaborative process. We are a ragtag crew of teachers, builders, scientists, gardeners, activists, and artists, but we are all firm believers that we have the ability to harness our own creativity and bring attention to it through careful resource appropriation and a doittogether, collaborative approach  which means that in the process, we are creating our own culture (and sometimes, economy) and building our own community. For as long as we remain open, we are committed to figuring out different ways we can transfer this empowering outlook to as many participants as possible.  ","The first milestone we reached was opening our doors December 5, 2012. After 9 months of fundraising, drawing, redrawing, building, permitting, repermitting, installing, inspecting, rebuilding, reinstalling, and reinspecting, we opened as a fully permitted restaurant, allowing us to legally sell food to the public. Throughout the process, our friends and neighbors continuously offered their hands and tools, making it possible to finish, install, and outfit TYFC for under $20,000. 





Weâ€™ve begun building a volunteer force and forged dozens of relationships, enabling us to source local produce, accept time dollars as currency, or offer a class on the History of Art and Food. 





We are proud to have hosted 3 diverse residency projects by multidisciplinary artists who each contextualized food in a different manner through their work at TYFC 





Cristina Victor/ L.A.Novela Special: ""As the daughter of CubanAmerican exiles born and raised in Miami, exile experience is at the root of my desire to contextualize a sense of cultural displacement. Through performance/food events, I create environments where parody, contradiction and nostalgia are ingredients to addressing the complexities of representing identity. My practice often involves appropriating stereotypes present in mass media, specifically about Latinos, through my alter ego Miami. By way of humor, kitschy aesthetics, and 'authentic' food, I intend to seduce people into a situation in which they are immersed in stereotypes that are familiar yet very clearly performed.""





Jennifer June Strawn/Superstition & Sustenance: ""Reportedly, superstitious belief is on the rise in modern society, neckandneck, it seems, with an everwidening faith in scientific fact. The purpose of this project is to examine the mechanism of superstition, its role in our private and public lives, and its relevance. As sensitive creatures vulnerable to the harsh realities of the world we live in, superstition, as a complicated system of smokeandmirrorsâ€”regardless of its actual efficacyâ€”is necessary to our survival as a species. Through the scope of whimsy, play, and humor, my mission is to present superstition in the form of food and foodforthought.""





Japanther/69Â¢ Only: ""In our research, we found that a nickel in 1930 is valued, coincidentally, at 69Â¢ today. But while automats used to provide public dignity for pennies on the dollar, in 2013, questions about value, quality and service are still highly contended. Our intention in creating a 69Â¢ Only store is to provide a place where people can eat and hang out affordably in LA. Weâ€™re challenging ourselves to fully consider the costs and value of things that are toooften omitted in the conversation: labor, modern manufacturing processes, etc. It is without a doubt that we will need to rely on creative resource gathering, careful proportioning, DIY processes, and the generosity of friends and strangers to realize a 69Â¢ Only store.""","Every single resident artist, volunteer, advisor and organization that has contributed to Thank You For Coming, whether by giving us farmfresh produce, being a 501c3 fiscal sponsor, working a kitchen shift, teaching a class, making oneofakind ceramic platters, or executing their creative vision. Each is important, and all together, they are integral. Mostly, we remain anonymous and amorphous  but here, we list as many names as possible to demonstrate how many collaborators have helped realize Thank You For Coming in the short time weâ€™ve been open. This list is yet incomplete, and we can only imagine that it will expand immensely:





http://www.thankyouforcoming.la/2013/03/everycollaboratorwhohasmadetyfcpossiblethusfar/","We rely on people to activate our space and so many of our evaluations are based on conversations or observations of interactive experiences. Though impossible to document and evaluate all of these experiences, weâ€™ve defined a few parameters that will help us measure success: 1. Number of active volunteers (around 30 right now); 2. Continued support and involvement of past artistsinresidence (only time will tell); 3. decibel level due to lively conversations during family suppers (definitely holding steady around 95dB); 4. Number of people with full bellies (safe to say over 1,000 so far); 5. Every single day we are able to remain open (114 and counting!).


","Thank You For Coming is dedicated to an alwaysopen, inclusive and connected â€œvibeâ€ where people of allages, families, and loners can congregate to feed and be fed and nourish and create; allowing for the possibility of an unexpected discovery of art and culture. We provide a place where people can hang out, have fun, develop personal relationships, and then choose their own mechanism for participation. Our approach encourages opportunities for social connectedness while participating in autonomous cultural practices such as organizing, creating, bartering and volunteering. 





We offer food as an accessible medium that can break down barriers of hierarchy in order to include more people into a conversation about our streets, neighborhoods, communities and city. By presenting and supporting Los Angeles residentsâ€™ creative projects and offering opportunities for true participation, we encourage coherent discourse addressing a bevy of Los Angelesspecific topics, including: food costs and sources, economy, education, transportation, recreation, cultural histories, etc.





Additionally, Thank You For Coming houses an artistinresidency program which provides a monthlong opportunity to use our kitchen, garden, and volunteer resources to play and explore. Through an open application process, we invite people with varying experiences and backgrounds to propose and develop a creative project in the context of sharing food. Residents then utilize our restaurant space as a platform for public engagement and creative experimentation. This program has and will continue to strongly support local applicants as the majority selected to be artistsinresidence at Thank You For Coming live in LA.


","By 2050, Allan Kaprowâ€™s wisdom about the blurring of art and life will be 100 years old:


â€œThey will discover out of ordinary things the meaning of ordinariness. They will not try to make them extraordinary but will only state their real meaning. But out of nothing they will devise the extraordinary and then maybe nothingness as well.â€ 





Weâ€™re at the midpoint of a journey thatâ€™s built upon those whoâ€™ve come before us. Weâ€™ve learned the most important thing is not to underestimate ourselves and our friends and our soontobe friends, all of whom are capable of accomplishing the extraordinary  





Everyday, we learn of examples of this occurring, and through this practice, we hope that all Angelenos will understand that they can create their own culture which views art as something that can be accessible and present in everyday life. By 2050, these types of practices should be embraced and encouraged in public and private spaces, institutional and noninstitutional places and integrated across all sectors.





In order for this to happen, we hope to see more funding for public art, nontraditional practices, and underdog organizations and individuals in Los Angeles by 2050. "
3102236,2013236,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ihaveadream.html,From Dream to Reality: IHADLA Will Help to Stop The Cycle of Poverty in Los Angeles 2050, Education,"<p>IHADLA sponsors entire grade levels of children from underperforming schools in lowincome, crimeridden areas of our city and provides them with the most longterm, comprehensive program of its kind in Los Angeles. Regardless of disability, all children are welcomed. The prime component of our program is academic achievement. For ten years, from third to twelfth grade, in both afterschool and summer programs, our â€œDreamersâ€ receive math and language arts instruction that not only better prepares them for California Standardized Testing, but also assures that they have the academic foundation required to perform at an accredited fouryear university. Parents/guardians are also provided with workshops on strategies that best prepare their child for academic success.</p>


 


<p>To accompany academic instruction, IHADLA provides college and career preparedness programming, including college site visits, SAT Prep workshops, and monthly lectures by professionals from a wide variety of careers. IHADLA also provides a variety of cultural enrichment opportunities which include engaging, informative field trips, arts and music courses and community service. Our objective is to expose Dreamers to enriching experiences outside of their neighborhoods that will reinforce their desire to achieve.</p>


 


<p>IHADLA is known as a â€œwhole lifeâ€ program because academic help, while crucial to success, does not guarantee the solid foundation needed to withstand negative external influences. Therefore, IHADLA partners with mental health providers to provide both group and individual counseling to any Dreamer that requires it. Dreamers also have mentors and tutors who act as positive adult role models and provide critical oneonone time that most do not receive at home. Sex education is also an important part of our programming, as teen pregnancy remains a pervasive problem in the communities we serve. During their high school years, Dreamers participate in the â€œBaby, Think It Overâ€ program, in which they are given lifelike infant dolls that require round the clock attention, coupled with sex education materials provided by Planned Parenthood. As our students are with IHADLA for over ten years with the same staff, they consider IHADLA â€œlike familyâ€, and are open with them about the trials in their life and relationships. These factors combined have kept teen births in the program incredibly low throughout our 25 year history.</p>


 


<p>Upon high school graduation, each Dreamer receives a college scholarship to the accredited university or trade school of their choice. IHADLA represents the most comprehensive, longterm program available for lowincome children in Los Angeles County.</p>


 


<p>IHADLA currently serves 297 students in four active program sites, which were chosen across Los Angeles to ensure that we are creating the most widespread impact possible. The numbers of children and adults positively affected by IHADLA is far greater than just the number of Dreamers, for our programs not only impact the students themselves, but their parents, siblings, peers and community members.</p>


 


<p>The following statistics encapsulate the need of our newest class of Dreamers at 99th Street Elementary School in Watts. The data exemplifies the types of needs of our other current program sites in Inglewood and Boyle Heights have as well:</p>


<p>â€¢43% English Learner population.</p>


<p>â€¢97% percent are from severely economically disadvantaged homes, including many that live in governmentsubsidized housing (projects). The 99th Street Elementary school in Watts is a Title 1 school.</p>


<p>â€¢41% of the parents of Dreamers have not attained their GED; almost none have attended a single day of college.</p>


<p>â€¢A significant portion of these students are under the jurisdiction of the dependency court system in Los Angeles, meaning they are in a foster care, a group home, or live with a nonparental guardian.</p>


<p>â€¢Within the past six months, 263 violent crimes have been committed in the Watts community, an area of only two square miles. Gang activity is on high, and many of the parents in our programs are members themselves.</p>


 


<p>IHADLA is unique, not only in its comprehensive nature and duration, but also due to its contract with each school district, giving IHADLA the ability to act as a powerful liaison between school district officials and parents, teachers, and school administrators alike.</p>","<p>As an organization, we have changed the lives of over 1,000 students in LA thus far by guiding them diligently through their academic careers and exposing them to enriching experiences which motivate them to attend college. Our results speak for themselves: Of our most recent class, 94% have graduated from high school, and 96% of those are in college. This more than doubles the average graduation rates that typically characterize these depressed areas. Programwide, 97% percent of Dreamers report that IHADLA is like a â€œsecond familyâ€ to them and Ninetyeight percent of Dreamers feel that their mentor will be there for them â€œno matter whatâ€ and can trust them with their problems.</p>





<p>Additionally, in 2011, IHADLA received the FBI Directorâ€™s Community Leadership Award for outstanding service to the community. Only one organization nationally is honored each year. We were thereafter able to forge a partnership with the FBI, and were able to match many of our Dreamers with FBI mentors. </p>





<p>Each of our current classes has achievements from this year which exemplify the success of our program overall:





In 2002, IHADLA adopted an entire grade level of almost 150 first grade students from Murchison Elementary School. Almost all of these students lived in the Ramona Gardens Projects in East LA, and many still do. These Dreamers are now on the eve of their high school graduation. Eightythree percent of our graduating Dreamers from this class will be attending college, and that number will grow next year when our second year seniors graduate as well. Colleges that Dreamers will be attending include: UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, USC, UCLA, Stanford University, Ithaca University, a host of Cal States throughout California, and many, many more.  





Adopted back to back in 2006 and 2007, IHADLA has two grades of Dreamers in Inglewood. This year, we are proud to report that these middleschool Dreamers are performing better than their peers on the California English Language Development Test. Seventyone percent of Dreamers were rated as â€œearly advancedâ€ or â€œadvancedâ€, compared with only 39% of their peers. These Dreamers continue to flourish academically, with 66% improving their grade point averages this year overall. Despite turbulence within the Inglewood school district, the majority of our Dreamers have above a 3.0 GPA, and many of those below are Dreamers in our special education program.





Our newest group of third grade Dreamers have not only melted our hearts, but inspired our organization as a whole. These children come from extraordinary circumstances, including domestic violence, familial gang membership, and unbelievable scenarios of poverty. Despite it all, these children are well on their way to becoming the future leaders of our society. Over the course of IHADLAâ€™s first six months of programming, these Dreamers went from 32% only passing their quarterly assessments to 62% at advanced/proficient level.</p>","IHADLA has partnered with mental health service providers Amanecer and Didi Hirsch to provide psychological counseling to our young Dreamers. An astounding 97% of students in our Watts class come from economically disadvantaged homes, and 30% are in the Dependency Court System, meaning Foster Care, Group Homes, or in the care of a nonparent guardian. Dreamers are now provided with group and oneonone therapy sessions, including artistic programs which offer Dreamers the opportunity to express themselves through different mediums. We partner with a host of organizations and companies that provide everything from physical fitness courses to organizations like The Story Project, which guides Dreamers through their own filmmaking project.","<p>The academic progress of Dreamers is measured consistently through teacher relationships, report cards, and CST scores. IHADLA staff regularly monitors homework completion and submission, and all Program Coordinators are responsible for completing Program Monthly Reports which detail events of the previous month and track the achievements and areas of needed improvement with specific students. These reports consistently monitor the effectiveness of the program.</p>  





<p>Additionally, IHADLA undergoes external evaluations every two to three years, and tracks statistics on grades, attendance, involvement in crime and drugs, pregnancies and familial discord through individual meetings, school records, and mentor reports.  </p>





<p>IHADLA believes in full transparency, and welcomes all queries by its supporters.</p>





<p>How IHADLA Measures and Defines Success:</p>





<p>Dreamers Achieve Academic Success


1. Dreamers are â€œontrackâ€ with enough credits to graduate from high school


2. Dreamers are enrolled in appropriate courses for college entrance requirements


3. Each Dreamerâ€™s average daily attendance rises or is at the level at which, in the combined judgment of their school and IHADLA, he/she are achieving their full potential. Dreamers will also indicate on annual survey that they feel connected to their school and intend to graduate


4. Dreamerâ€™s GPA rises or is at the level at which, in the combined judgment of their school and IHADLA, he/she are achieving their full potential


5. Dreamers will perform better than their comparison population on reading, writing and math CST


6. Dreamers will graduate high school/receive GED at a rate greater than the LAUSD nonDreamer population


7. Dreamers will pursue postsecondary education at a rate greater than the LAUSD nonDreamer population</p>





<p>Dreamers Develop Emotional Intelligence


1. Dreamers will report increased selfconfidence, perseverance, conflict resolution skills, and social competence


2. Dreamers will report that they have a caring and trusting relationship with IHADLA staff</p>





<p>Dreamers Develop Master Life Skills


1. Dreamers report that they are making positive life choices and are engaging in healthy risktaking


2. Dreamers report that they have learned skills for meaningful employment


3. Mentors report on whether Dreamers have learned skills for meaningful employment or not. </p>


<p>Dreamers Develop CollegeReadiness Skills


1. Dreamers enter college at a higher rate than nonDreamer LAUSD graduates


2. Dreamers report they are more knowledgeable about college admission requirements</p>","This past year, LAUSD shortened the academic school year, laid off hundreds of qualified teachers, cut almost all afterschool, art and music programs, and reduced funding dramatically. Ironically, students have then been asked to perform higher on California Standardized Tests. Our Dreamers already contend with substandard living, nutrition, and educational facilities. IHADLA aims to fill these gaps and beyond with the understanding that a better life for these children means a better life for all of us. 





IHADLA specifically chooses different program sites throughout Los Angeles so that we make the most impact possible across the county. By providing the children with the greatest needs with IHADLAâ€™s â€œwholelifeâ€ programming, we are dramatically increasing their opportunity to succeed. Higher graduation rates, and healthier lifestyles, mean that they are less likely to rely upon the public welfare system and also less likely to cause crime, which leads to a decreased burden on the prison system in California. High school dropouts are four times more likely to be unemployed as those who have a college degree, and are more likely to require federal assistance. They are also more likely to be delinquents, as eightytwo percent of prisoners in America are dropouts. 





Most of all, by supporting IHADLA, Angelenos are making an investment in the future of our city. The future innovators of science, technology, social science, etc. are standing before us at 99th Street Elementary School in Watts. They have extraordinary potential. However, most of their parents never finished high school, and even fewer still know what itâ€™s like to earn above the poverty line. Who, if not IHADLA, will lead these children towards towards their dreams? To turn our backs on them would be to turn our backs on our own community, and our economy, and all of our futures. 


","<p>Our ultimate dream, of course, would be for our organizationâ€™s mission to become obsolete. However, the problems that we are combating in these communities are generational, and only provide for as many students to enter the program as funding makes possible. In the year 2050, with support The â€œI Have a Dreamâ€ Foundation â€“ Los Angeles could be adopting multiple classes each year at schools in need. With the appropriate funding, IHADLA could potentially serve up to thousands more children. Every group of Dreamers sponsored by IHADLA means we are changing the income and educational level of hundreds, not just our Dreamers, but their parents, family members, peers, and ultimately, their communities. We will therefore see a decrease in public aid and uncrowded prisons, as well as safer streets for us all. We will see a drop in teen birth rates and a dramatic increase in high school graduation rates. </p>





<p>We will also see our Dreamers become the heads of our companies, the leaders of change, and the innovators of society. We, as a foundation, are ambitious and hopeful about the future. We see the struggle and triumph of our Dreamers on an everyday basis, and know that we can make dreams possible for so many more. After 25 years of service to Los Angeles County, we have gained a reputation for taking children deemed â€œwithout hopeâ€ and turning them into college graduates. </p>





<p>IHADLA wants to keep fulfilling our promise to the Los Angeles by finding new ways to alleviate the everchanging challenges facing our youth in the highcrime, violent neighborhoods we focus on. This generous grant has the potential to get us there.</p>

3102237,2013237,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/advotproject.html,Advot: Theater to Facilitate Change, Education,"<p>What vision will Los Angeles aspire to for its almost 3 million children, as they wait to be inspired, empowered and transformed? Simply trying to keep them safe, out of trouble and in school relies on management and control ideas, which are not very compelling. The schools alone cannot provide what Los Angeles youth need to lead productive and healthy lives within the Los Angeles community, as evidenced by low testing, high dropout rates and low participation in higher education. Even more remarkable, Los Angeles bears the burden of disparity based on ethnicity, socio-economic class and geography within the Los Angeles landscape. As more students opt for pathways to success other than traditional models, some even involving crime, the importance of preparing youth with the skills necessary to build healthy relationships bears reason to be the keys to long-term success.<p>


<p>The Advot Project, together with community organizations the Pico Union Project and the Los Angeles Red Shield Youth & Community Center, aspire to empower young people to thrive and build healthier connected communities.  ADVOT means ripples, in the Hebrew language, and represents the many ripples a healthy relationship and doing good can have on a community. The Advot Project seeks to provide strategies to help prevent violence, seek social justice, and help build healthy communities through the use of drama techniques to improve the lives of vulnerable populations. For the past two decades Naomi Ackerman, founder/executive director of The Advot Project has used art to promote peace, change, and encourage self-empowerment. This work and the strong belief in the power of theatre to facilitate transformation inspired the creation of the Advot Project and remain the driving values and essence on which we operate.</p>


<p>By working with often disenfranchised youth to develop and practice skills through the power of theater and the arts to live a meaningful life, enter the workforce and become functional members of their community. Rather than aspiring for higher tests scores or more competitive workforce, we aim to enable young people to achieve connections with others through joy, kindness and generosity. These youth strive for fulfillment by contributing in a meaningful way through the quality of their own experiences. </p>


<p>To achieve that goal, the Advot Project will implement two programs: 1) The Healthy Community Program (HCP) provides presentations geared at prevention of physical and emotional violence, such as bullying; and 2) the Healthy Relationships Initiative (HRI) provides disenfranchised youth with opportunities for social and emotional learning. These programs teach skills on working with others, appropriate communications, and dialogue. By teaching and practicing communication skills, as well as working on social relations and understanding of social behaviour, Advot navigates youth into employed and healthy functional working community members.</p>


<p>Many of the participants of our programs come in lacking the knowledge and capability of having simple conversations. Relationships 101 uses dramatic exercises to practice and learn new ways of engagement and communication in order to be better educated in interpersonal relations thus achieving healthier  and more successful approaches to work, life and citizenship.</p>


<p>Our Healthy Relationships Initiatives implements the Relationships 101 curriculum, using the unique method of theater techniques, as used in the Theater of the Opressed, to teach the prevention of violence.  Working with disenfranchised youth, theater methods provide a â€œsafeâ€ place to express ones â€œrealâ€ feelings and thoughts.  These techniques have been extremely successful when we implemented Relationships 101 with Los Angeles area high schools and in Detention Camps.  The Detention Camp program has been funded by three Los Angeles Supervisors and for every young person that does not re-enter the â€œsystemâ€, there is an annual savings of over $100,000 per person.</p>


<p>Our Healthy Community Program (HCP) includes one woman performances of â€œFlowers Arenâ€™t Enoughâ€. These performances have been seen by social workers, police officers, prison guards, probation officers, health workers, womenâ€™s organizations and general public that wanted the message of prevention of violence and how it impacts society.  â€œFlowers Arenâ€™t Enoughâ€ has been performed more than 1500 times in 7 countries and 3 continents.  </p>


<p>We wish to empower these youth to establish control over their lives, which comes having control over their own behaviors, attitudes and perceptions. These youth will be the change agents in their own lives by having healthy relationships stemming from skillful communication skills. By working collaboratively with local organizations, arts groups and civic institutions, we build a communal response to the needs of transforming our youth and through them our future.</p>","<p>Through our Healthy Community Program and performances of â€œFlowers Arenâ€™t Enoughâ€ (see videos to see the show itself and interviews with the creators: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESG8SuW-6Eo & http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN75Od3hJf0 ) we have raised awareness of thousands of people in many communities globally to the importance of healthy relationships, respect, and the dire consequences of abusive relationships.  If violence is left unchallenged and unchecked in the microcosm of the dating scene and the family home, then it will mushroom into larger conflicts. Without intervention, individuals caught in the cycle of abuse may be at risk for death, disability, injury, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Raising consciousness to the importance of healthy relationships its correlation to a healthy community and the responsibility that each and every one of us has to make sure our relationships and the ones around us are worthy, good and functioning, is one of our most important achievements.</p>


 


<p>Out of  Flowers arenâ€™t Enough the educational curriculum  Relationships 101 was born Relationships 101 has been implemented in the past 3 years all over Los-Angeles county, at  public schools, private schools, summer camps and The LA County girls and boys probation facilities. Having an impact on young adults lives and teaching them the importance of healthy communications/relationships has lead to successful outcomes.</p>





<p>Participants of the program articulate their success far better than we can:


 


<p>All of Relationships 101 was very interesting, but my favorite part was acting out the different situations, they put everyday life into a perspective, and showed where you can make clear choices, you can chose NOT to argue and make things worse, by using I messages, saying how you feel, I feel this, and I feel that or I donâ€™t like that, that makes me feel bad â€¦.that really helped !!!</p>


Student -San Pedro High</p>


 


<p>I feel like I can handle certain situations in my relationships better than I did before. I feel better knowing that it isnâ€™t bad to stand up for yourself or do what you think is right, even if it is going against your boyfriend or girlfriend. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, we are all worthy of a healthy relationship! </p>


Student - Verbum Dei High School</p>





<p>I learned in relationships 101 that anything that happens to us in the real world looks better when we act it out.  This program, helped me with a lot of frustrations. I learned to collaborate, be respectful, responsible, and ready. I am so happy I had the opportunity to realize that you need to think twice about what we really go through and how to work things out with every human being in the world. I learned how to accept things that I canâ€™t change and to change the things I can. </p>

Questions address the participantsâ€™ understanding of healthy relationships, interpersonal communication skills, and the impact of choices on likely outcomes. The survey results are analyzed using a statistical program, and paired t-tests are used to assess statistical significance between pre- and post-test responses (set at .05). A feedback form is completed after each workshop. These indicate, from the participantsâ€™ perspective, their retrospective view on new concepts and skills that were acquired in each session. It is expected that a minimum of 75% of the participants will indicate they learned something new.</p>





<p>A follow-up survey is repeated six months after the completion of the program to provide a measure of medium-term impact and durability of results. The survey results will be again analyzed to determine retention of attitudes and behaviors over time.

Empowered individuals capable of using exemplary communication skills develop healthier relationships with family members, neighbors and become more active citizens. The greater their capacity to communicate and engage in both  day-to-day conversations with peers and adults, they will be capable of entering into greater conversations about civic good, politics and service. As active members of their local communities, within schools, on the streets, at jobs, etc, they will bear the creative ability to not only be productive, but also transformative. As more young people, especially in isolated communities due to geography, ethnicity, or socio-economic classs, find the ability to navigate the complex system of institutional, civic and professional networks, the stratified nature of the Los Angele ecosystem becomes more flattened and a sustainable and healthy city. The greater the capacity for todayâ€™s young generation, especially those without the privilege that comes to many others, to find their voice, and how to use it effectively to communicate their needs, feelings and dreams, the stronger each citizen, community and our city will be.","There are other programs in LA that are working and using theatre skills to create performances that  speak a social message,  These theater groups do incredible work, using theater as a tool for self-expression, a vehicle   to tell important stories, as well as using the stage as a voice for the unheard.


 


 At the Advot Project we use theater techniques as a tool to teach individuals new behaviors and how to be better communicators.





Our work stems out of the works of Theater of the Oppressed founded by Augusto Boal.  Boal's techniques use theater as means of promoting social change. The audience becomes an active participant, such that as ""spect-actors"" they explore, show, analyses and transform the reality in which they are living.


 


The basic principle is using theater as a rehearsal for reality â€“recovering a language we already possess; we teach how to live in society through the playing theater games.


 


The Advot Project uses theater techniques to teach participants how to take responsibility and take charge of their lives and by teaching new skills and healthy ways to interact and deal with   societal situations.


 


In our programs we strive to instill the importance of expressing the needs, desires and most important what participants are uncomfortable with. Our work focuses on practicing this with puppets, masks and other theatrical tools and creative writing methods .


At the Advot Project we believe that this kind of self-expression is a crucial skill to achieve a successful life and healthy societal participant.  When an individual can be in a nonviolent, honest dialogue with his /her family neighbors and coworkers they  have  great potential to thrive."
3102238,2013238,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ExNLA.html,Education by Nature: Los Angeles, Education,"The goal of this application is to fund the further development and expansion of the Los Angeles iteration of Education by Nature, a national model aimed at increasing STEM learning opportunities. In LA, we are focusing on bringing STEM education opportunities to underserved LA schools while cultivating scaffolded, leveraged collaboration between nonprofit organizations. By facilitating coordination among multiple nonprofit natural science education organizations, the Education by Nature: Los Angeles (ExN:LA) model links the existing science programs of multiple organizations, focuses those programs on the same classrooms, and ensures that programs build on each other. Together, ExN:LA partners deliver more hours of STEM instruction to classrooms than any one organization has the capacity to provide.  ExN:LA, led locally by The Childrenâ€™s Nature Institute (CNI), is now in its second successful implementation year reaching 1,260 students and 37 teachers across 2 diverse Los Angeles communities in Council Districts 1 and 4.    


 This groundbreaking model changes the way programs are delivered to students. It shifts delivery from the traditional method of one-time, sporadic, and variable classroom services (based on individual teachersâ€™ requests) to a strategic, comprehensive and sustainable model of educating for depth, providing a wealth of integrated high-quality programs to schools in need. We would like to expand the reach of ExN:LA to further impact the educational markers that are intrinsic to LA student success such as subject learning, overall enjoyment of learning, and environmental stewardship. We also want to learn which components of ExN:LA are specific to Los Angeles, so we can focus on developing those. An award from myLA2050 will be used to fund further model replication throughout Los Angeles Unified School District. 


Currently, ExN:LA focuses on young children â€“ age 0-8 â€“ in school, and their families, helping them all develop scientific habits of mind as required by the Common Core State Standards. As ExN:LA grows, we will expand to include programming for students of all ages. Partner curricula are vetted to be sure they capitalize on childrenâ€™s innate, are in alignment with the standards and are scaffolded to specific learning objectives specified by teachers. Children learn about their environment, raising awareness about environmental issues in their communities. They develop fine motor skills and engineering mindsets by constructing their own learning tools ranging from watershed models to up-cycled paper bag forests. Children learn to ask questions and to reason through to the answers; to make observations and to communicate their thinking. They develop confidence to share ideas and to disagree constructively. This model helps teachers and students address necessary material -- both content knowledge and habits of mind â€“ that are necessary for their ongoing success and that are specified in the Common Core.


ExN:LA lessons come through the lens of environmental stewardship, and focus in part on changing and measuring behavior. By teaching students, parents and teachers to think critically about the environment and their role in it, we hope to instill in them an understanding of and love for the natural world around them. Through ExN:LA, people learn scientific facts and behaviors that will enable them to act on their own behalf and on behalf of the environment, and to see how the two are very much intertwined. Part of our ongoing evaluation will measure which lessons result in the greatest content learning and the greatest behavior changes, so we can disseminate that knowledge to our partner organizations to ensure that our environmental education partners are all utilizing best practices throughout LA.


CNI is physically housed within the Magnolia Place Family Center, which is also the home of the Magnolia Community Initiative (MCI). MCI is a 70+ partner collaboration focused in the Council District 1 Pico-Union community to learn â€œWhat would it take to have the 35,000 children living in the 500 blocks of the Magnolia Catchment Area break all records of success in their education, health, and the quality of nurturing care and economic stability they receive from their families and community.â€  MCI is designed to galvanize the community and organize partners to neighborhood development, rather than distribute services, and fosters working in innovative ways. CNI is the â€œgreen armâ€ and active participant in MCI, striving to work with the community infuse environmental learning and awareness into neighborhood and family development. MCIâ€™s initiative design has informed our guiding principles as we construct the ExN:LA collaboration. Overlaying ExN:LA to some of the schools within the Magnolia Catchment Area adds value to both models and helps us streamline, utilize best practices, and collaborate with a variety of partners and stakeholders. ","CNIâ€™s mission is to educate children, families, and their communities through interactive experiences with nature and to cultivate respect and responsibility for the natural environment.  We are the only organization in Los Angeles that focuses exclusively on environmental education for young children during their most impressionable years: birth through age 8. CNI works with more than 100 schools, early-education centers and social service agencies to serve 15,000 children each year. We focus on reaching children in underserved communities to share with them the wonder of nature as a tool for academic achievement, personal growth, and community building.


CNI was founded in 1985 by three mothers who were anxious to find ways to teach young children about nature outside of the classroom. We have been at the forefront of the movement to connect children with nature ever since. The organization was run by a core group of volunteers that led young families on walks at area parks and beaches. After the Los Angeles riots in 1992, motivated by the call for equity, justice and inclusion, CNI launched the outreach Nature Discovery Program to give children from low-income neighborhoods and academically low-ranking schools of Los Angeles the opportunity to learn science, math and reading skills through experiences with the natural world.  In 2000, CNI added a traveling classroom called the WonderMobile to the program (a visit that includes live animals and various natural artifacts).


          In 2010, CNI became the ""environmental arm"" of the Magnolia Place Family Center. As part of the groundbreaking Magnolia Community Initiative, CNI actively collaborates within a network of more than 70 service providers to improve the quality of life, including educational outcomes, for the 100,000 people living within a 500-block radius of the Center.  CNI offers a wide range of hands-on activities for families living in West Adams, Pico-Union, and the North Figueroa Corridor. These communities represent some of Los Angeles County's most challenged neighborhoods with historically low educational access and a high rate of families living at or below the federal poverty level. We have served more than 350,000 children, their parents, and teachers in the greater Los Angeles area since we started, and show no signs of slowing down. 


	Joining MCI gave CNI the latitude and capability to embark on the leadership role for ExN:LA, a collaboration modeled on MCI and focused on bringing continuous, high-quality environmental education to schools throughout Los Angeles. Now in its second year, ExN:LA has grown to include the entire 2nd and 3rd grades at 2 schools, 6 partner organizations and the MCI network of collaborators and community. ExN:LA is part of national Education by Nature umbrella with iterations throughout California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, each of which is designed to meet the specific needs of its community, and to share best practices and ideas with each other","Current ExN:LA nonprofit partners include Heal the Bay, California Science Center, Natural History Museum of LA County, reDiscover Center, EnrichLA,  Gibbon Conservation Center, Farms to Preschool and Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust. Education stakeholders such as teachers, students and community members are also essential to the robust efficacy of the model.  The Magnolia Community Initiative network of agencies, evaluators and community development consultants are also our partners.  


The expansion to 27 more LAUSD classrooms as this proposal outlines will require us to engage 6-10 more environmental education partners.  We will also continue efforts to cultivate a formal partner relationship with the LAUSD District itself.  


","Our evaluation plan includes pre- and post-tests on program efficacy. We have contracted with evaluators from UCLA, USC, and ETI Consultants to help us design and implement our evaluation goals.


We want to evaluate: student experiences, and the educational value therein; student understanding and perception of their relationship with the environment; how environmental educational is intrinsic to child, family and community development; deficiencies and remediation within the collaborative models.


We intend to: share all results online and at public events; provide feedback for partners and funders. Ultimately, we will move education away from achieving grades and onto learning, and show how this is especially important in very young learners.


","ExN:LA is a local model that meets the needs of the students, schools and communities served by the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Since 1985, CNI has served over 300,000 LAUSD students with our free, outreach Nature Discovery Program and our weekly Community Nature Programs at the Magnolia Place Family Center. We know first-hand the struggles of working within such a large district and the disenfranchisement of our community. ExN:LA is built on the idea that, to improve education, LA-based nonprofit partners, teachers, students and families must work together.  Evidence shows the only way to truly affect large-scale reform, whether in education, community or family development is to shift from â€œprogram deliveryâ€ to participating in a â€œcommunity of practice.â€ U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says, â€œWhen families learn together and where schools truly become the heart and center of a neighborhood â€“ a community anchor- there are tremendous dividends for children.â€


ExN:LA is exactly this kind of community anchor. Lesson plans focus on local issues, including nature in LA, the interplay of the city and its waterways, growing food in schoolyards, and changing human behavior to positively impact the world around us. The children we teach are concrete learners â€“ they understand best the things they can see and touch. Project based learning helps children understand their place in the world and develop a connection to its care. 


 ExN:LA helps teachers expose their students to STEM-based thinking that builds future success. Opportunities include modeling of scientific logic; professional development workshops; field trips; and lesson plans aligned with state curricula. ExN:LA benefits Los Angeles by improving the educational framework at large, making STEM subjects more accessible and addressing many of the issues weâ€™ve had teaching STEM subjects to LAâ€™s children. 


A 2011 RAND study â€œPreschool Adequacy and Efficiency in California,â€ found that 40-60% of Californiaâ€™s 2nd and 3rd graders are not proficient in core subjects, including STEM. Larger gaps exist for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, including Latinos, African-Americans and English language learners, the main demographics in our community. These achievement gaps have early roots: the groups who are behind in third grade were behind when they entered kindergarten.  


A 2012 fact-sheet from Preschool California supports that claim, stating that early experiences â€“from the time children are born to the first day of kindergarten â€“ shape whether a childâ€™s brain develops a strong foundation for the learning, health and behavior that follow. â€œEarly interventions for disadvantaged children are more economically efficient and produce higher returns than remedial programs to help teenagers and young adults catch up later on,â€ writes to James Heckman, of the University of Chicago and Nobel Laureate in Economics.  ExN:LA focuses on science and nature experiences for LAâ€™s youngest learners.","Success in the year 2050 includes all children having access to â€œcollaborative educationâ€ that increases exposure to project based learning, outdoor enrichment, and allows them to ask and answer their own questions. Schools would be full of hands-on, age-appropriate activities, that channel childrenâ€™s innate curiosity into their learning. We believe that education should teach students to â€œbe scientistsâ€ â€“ to be curious and to continually investigate answers to their questions â€“ about everything around them. This should be our educational status-quo.  We want to be part of bringing opportunities where they arenâ€™t currently, in the hopes that we can help develop the resources and the community to provide for themselves. Success in 2050, for us, would include components of self-sufficiency as well as our continued presence and community building. 


Specifically, we would like the philosophy behind ExN:LA to have spread throughout LAUSD while other iterations of Education by Nature have spread throughout the state and the country. In this successful vision of 2050, all children have access to high quality education, and they are learning to think more critically and behave more environmentally. Schools and other education partners have learned to work collaboratively with each other and across sectors, and kids are benefiting from their efforts.  Teachers â€“ both formal and informal â€“ are able to share best practices, while non-profit partners share resources across the board. There is trust, there is room for experimentation, there is real learning. 


	Another indicator of success would be that Education by Nature is no longer the primary access to environmental programming for our students. We hope that our partner organizations â€“ even the ones that do not focus on environmental education â€“ will pick up our example and use our lessons in their own work. Whether nature hunts or walks with families, it is very easy to engage a community through the environment around them. We hope that by 2050 we will have set a clear enough example and provided enough resources that we wonâ€™t be the only ones utilizing environmental education to build our community. 


Finally, weâ€™d like to see not only our students and our partners making good environmental and education decisions, but our community as well. Weâ€™d like to see the parents throughout Los Angeles have the ability, desire, and understanding to create the kinds of surroundings â€“ educational and otherwise â€“ for their children that theyâ€™d like. Weâ€™d like our community to make good decisions for itself, including educational and environmental ones. ExN:LA aims to teach children to think like scientists, but also to teach caregivers and guardians to gently guide childrenâ€™s education. Success in 2050 would be to see real progress in each of these areas. "
3102239,2013239,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TheCityProject.html,Discovering LAâ€™s Forgotten Landmarks: Celebrating Our Diverse Cultural History,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"Los Angeles County is home to over 1,000 City of Los Angeles HistoricCultural Monuments, over 100 California Historical Landmarks, and 20 National Historic Landmarks. Some, like the Coliseum, are prominent fixtures in the area. Others are hidden, such as the first Jewish site in LA tucked away on a hill by Dodger Stadium, or St. Vincentâ€™s Place, the first institution of higher education in Southern California in what is now an alley between Broadway and Hill. Our idea is to create an interactive online guide and userfriendly smartphone app that highlight city, state, and national cultural and historic landmarks in LA County by mapping them with linked photos and content about each siteâ€™s history and cultural relevance. This service would increase exposure to the full spectrum of LAâ€™s landmarks and paint a more complex, multicultural portrait of LA.





Previously, we mapped over 940 City of Los Angeles monuments, with interesting findings (www.mapsportal.org/thecityproject/monuments). The official government listings contain limited information about the number, name, location, and date of designation of a monument. Through our research and mapping, we linked city monuments to map locations and added photos and brief content about the history and cultural relevance of the site. In so doing, we discovered that only ten percent of the city monuments were related to people of color, women, or Native Americans. This stands at odds with the diversity brought on by migration and immigration that was pivotal in LAâ€™s creation, and it reflects the glaring inequities in our city. Statedesignated landmarks more closely approach an accurate reflection of LAâ€™s demographics, with nearly 40 percent of the landmarks honoring people of color, women, or Native Americans.





We will update and expand upon our online mapping of city monuments to include city monuments designated since our prior work and all state and federal historic landmarks. We will create a smartphone app that provides photos, locations, and content about each siteâ€™s history and cultural relevance to facilitate onthego access to and appreciation of all of LAâ€™s landmarks.





Mapping LAâ€™s cultural and historic landmarks will reinvigorate forgotten cultural aspects of the countyâ€™s history. Local residents will gain a deeper understanding of their neighborhoods, and visitors will be able to see LA beyond its famous tourist attractions. In so doing, we hope to draw attention to the past and present demographics of the city and celebrate the history and diversity of LA.


","The City Project is a nonprofit organization committed to achieving equal justice, democracy, and livability in Los Angeles. Since our founding in 2000, we have influenced the investment of over $41 billion in underserved communities.





Working with community allies, we have helped create the Los Angeles State Historic Park and RÃ­o de Los Angeles State Park as part of the greening of the LA River. We helped save the sacred Native American site of Panhe and San Onofre State Beach and helped save the community and park in Baldwin Hills. We have mapped and analyzed green access and equal justice for nine counties in Southern California and beyond.





We have received recognition and awards from the American Public Health Association, Hispanic Business Magazine, American Society of Landscape Architects, California Parks and Recreation Foundation, Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board, City of Los Angeles, Community Partners, and Cultural Landscape Foundation.


","We will work with a GIS consultant, a web consultant, and an app developer to package the research and content we create.","After we launch the app, we will measure success by the number of downloads. We hope the number of downloads will correspond with increased familiarity with all of LAâ€™s cultural and historic landmarks. We also can include a checkin feature in the app to gauge if people are visiting the landmarks.","Los Angeles has never been a monolithic city or county. The cultural and historic landmarks in LA chronicle the major developments in the cityâ€™s formation, in which people of diverse ethnicities played a crucial role. By increasing awareness of these landmarks, our project will enhance understanding and fill the knowledge gaps in LAâ€™s history. 





Beyond this education, our project will increase traffic at the lesserknown landmarks. For example, there is a plaque commemorating La Mesa Battlefield, where the last battle of the war on the California front was fought in 1847, by the railroad tracks in the tiny industrial area of Vernon. Generating interest in this landmark could spur development, beautification, or perhaps green space around that city, which currently lacks parks. 





Specifically, this project will benefit cultural vitality in LA; ultimately, it will work towards reducing the inequity that is inherent in the county. People of diverse ethnicities were instrumental in LAâ€™s founding and continue to play a critical role today. By making forgotten historic landmarks visible on the LA landscape, we can create a more holistic sense of place that includes all those who live in it.","The diverse and vibrant art, music, dance, fashion, cinematography, and photography in LA that continuously push the envelope would continue to thrive in 2050. Along with this forward momentum, however, success in 2050 would also include preservation of LAâ€™s past in a manner that is alive, engaging, and dynamic. By the year 2050, the number of cultural and historic landmarks in LA will have surpassed the number registered now. And an app might be as archaic and obsolete as floppy disks are now. Nonetheless, we hope that in 2050 the spirit of our project will be manifested in an inclusive, multicultural Los Angeles that celebrates its past."

Renowned choreographer and New York City ballet soloist Benjamin Millepied.<p>Originally established in 1999, The Gabriella Foundation was founded by Liza Bercovici in memory of her daughter Gabriella, a thirteen year old who loved to dance.  The Foundationâ€™s initial program, everybody dance!, began in 2000 by providing 12 weekly dance classes to 35 children in a lowincome housing project just west of downtown LA. That program has since grown to become the largest dance program in LA providing sequential, longterm dance training to underserved, innercity children and youth.  Today we provide approximately 200 weekly schoolbased and afterschool/weekend classes to more than 2,200 innercity students at six innercity sites, including Camino Nuevo charter school campuses and our studios downtown.  Yet we fall far short of demand for our programs:  In 2012, nearly 1,000 children applied through our lottery for 125 available openings.</p><p>In 2005, we established Gabriella Charter School (GCS), the only dancethemed public elementary school in LA (and perhaps the nation), where students take an hour of dance each school day.  


While 91% of our students are socioeconomically disadvantaged and 41% are English Learners, GCSâ€™ 2012 API score of 894 make it one of the topperforming public schools in LA.  In 2012, GCS was named â€œCharter School of the Yearâ€ by the California Charter Schools Association.  LA Unified, proud of our schoolâ€™s success, has established a unique longterm facilities agreement with us in Echo Park and built new dance studios for our use; LAUSD also invited us to triple enrollment from our original plan and expand to a K8 continuum.  Today GCS enrolls 463 students and maintains a lengthy waiting list.</p><p>Now, The Gabriella Foundation seeks to dramatically change the opportunity gap in dance education across LAâ€™s public schools by training K8 teachers â€“ both trained dancers as well as those with no formal dance training  to implement dance enrichment programs and integrated dance curriculum to ensure that every child in LA is able to experience quality dance education.  Not only will ensuring access to quality dance education for all children improve Arts & Cultural Vitality in LA, but also Education (and thus Income & Employment), Health, and Social Connectedness for our City.</p><p>Our acclaimed dance faculty is comprised of professional dancers described by the LA Times as ""some of the best children's dance instructors in the world.â€  These experts in dance have worked closely with our academic faculty over the years to design curriculum that integrates dance into â€œcoreâ€ learning (English language arts, math, science and social science) both thematically and literally, all tied to state academic standards for each grade level. </p><p>After years of decimating funding for arts education, the LAUSD School Board recently passed the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ Resolution, declaring that it would restore arts education funding over the next several years and treat art as a â€œcoreâ€ subject.   This renewed focus on arts education includes an emphasis on professional development and recruiting teachers who can integrate the arts into a standardsbased curriculum.  Gabriella is uniquely positioned to ensure LAâ€™s teachers have the training and resources they need to successfully implement dance programs in schools across LA, benefiting tens of thousands of children in the years to come.</p><p>This grant would enable us to launch a comprehensive teacher training program with two strands â€“ one for experienced dancers hired to teach dance enrichment classes at K8 public schools and afterschool programs, and one to train certified K8 teachers who are not experienced dancers in ways to integrate dance elements into their daily curriculum.  In addition to disseminating our awardwinning curriculum for use in other schools, we will offer teacher training workshops, webbased resources and interactive support including (lowtech) videos with â€œdemo lessons,â€ and establish a hub for highquality dance education in LA.</p><p>As LAUSD has recognized, highquality arts education for children â€œincreases test scores across every subject area, lowers dropout rates and helps close achievement and opportunity gaps for students of color and students from lowincome families; . . . increases average daily attendance and student enrollment; [and] . . . young adults of low socioeconomic status (SES)  . . . earn better grades, demonstrate higher rates of college enrollment, achieve higher GPA scores, develop greater selfesteem and exhibit higher levels of civic involvement.â€  (http://home.lausd.net/apps/news/show_news.jsp?REC_ID=273222&id=3)   In short, dance education will benefit everyone in LA. </p>


","<p>â€œI canâ€™t tell you how much this program and everything it stands for means to me. . . .  I learned to love, I learned to cope, I learned to express myself, and most importantly, I learned to BE. I am much more confident now that I know what dancing is and what it brings to me. I am infinitely grateful!â€   Sandy Vasquez, 18 (Everybody Dance! participant; current UCLA Regentsâ€™ Scholar doublemajoring in Chicano Studies and English)</p>





<p>Everybody dance!  is the largest dance program in Los Angeles providing sequential, longterm dance training to innercity children. Our programâ€™s achievements have been highlighted in the Los Angeles Times, Dance Magazine, People Magazine, Biography Magazine, California Lawyer Magazine, Family Circle Magazine and on multiple television and radio stations.  Our faculty of professional dancers has been described by the Los Angeles Times as ""some of the best children's dance instructors in the world.â€</p>





The dance program has opened doors for our students, enabling them to win prestigious awards and scholarships to acclaimed dance schools and academic institutions, including Juilliard, Rock School of Ballet, Kirov Academy of Ballet and summer programs at American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, and Bolshoi Ballet.  Some of our alumni are now using their training to become professional dancers with companies such as the Los Angeles Ballet, Vox Dance Theatre and Complexions Contemporary Ballet in NYC.  





Gabriella Charter School was honored at the 19th Annual California Charter Schools Conference in 2012 with the Hart Vision Award for Charter School of the Year as an innovator and leader among charter schools statewide.  GCS received the Music Centerâ€™s 2011 BRAVO Program Award, which honors educators and schools for their commitment to delivering exemplary arts education in both visual and performing arts.  Our faculty and staff are frequently invited to give presentations at universities, arts institutions and national conferences, such as the Colburn School of Performing Arts, UCLA, the Delta Kappa Gamma XI Education Conference (an educational honor society for school leaders and teachers), the California Charter School Summit and the National Dance Education Organizationâ€™s Annual Conference.   





We believe our dance program is directly responsible for our schoolâ€™s academic success as well:  In 2010, the California Department of Education (â€œCDEâ€) awarded Gabriella Charter School the Title I Academic Achievement Award, recognizing significant academic achievement by disadvantaged students who had doubled the academic targets set for them by the CDE for two consecutive years.  GCS also received sixyear accreditation (the highest possible) from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, which sited GCS as a â€œmodel school for any number of schools wishing to get high academics in a predominantly lowincome and underserved community.â€ (WASC Self Study Visiting Committee Report, April 2010.)


","Working with our primary partner, LAUSD, our teacher training program will be highly collaborative and build on existing partnerships.  The following are just a few illustrative examples of our current partners:





â€¢	Camino Nuevo Charter Academy (dance classes for their students) and Pueblo Nuevo Development (rentfree studios in PicoUnion) 


â€¢	LA County Arts Commission (teacher professional development) and The Annenberg Foundation (Alchemy Program) 


â€¢	Skirball Cultural Center, Staples Center Foundation, UCLA, Music Center of Los Angeles, Marat Daukayev School of Ballet and more (tickets for students to attend performances)


â€¢	Benjamin Millepied, Contra Tiempo Urban Latino Dance Theater and BODYTRAFFIC (free master classes for our students) 


","<p>â€œWOW!...We were all so impressed and magnificently entertained by your talented and gifted multiage dancers. . . . (T)he strength and variety of dance training you masterfully provide was clearly evident. . . . You confirm the rumors I have heard, that you are a remarkable organization, based on high expectations, rigor and consistent results.â€   LAUSD Local Superintendent Richard Alonzo, 2008.</p>





<p>Currently, Dr. Tiffany Berry, Research Associate Professor in the School of Behavioral and Organizational Sciences at Claremont Graduate University and Associate Director at Claremont Evaluation Center, is conducting a yearlong independent evaluation of our dance programs to assess outcomes and strengthen inhouse evaluation capacity. That evaluation is expected to be completed this summer, and will certainly inform development of teacher training workshops.  Throughout our organizationâ€™s 13 year history we have collected extensive data:</p>





â€¢	Parents and students are surveyed annually to gather input on program impact (emotional, academic and physical) and to assess programmatic strengths and weaknesses.


â€¢	Parent feedback also is collected at quarterly parent meetings (preceded by popular parent dance classes).


â€¢	Teachers and staff participate in extensive collaborative planning time and professional development, providing feedback to program leaders and one another about curriculum, student progress and program efficacy.  


â€¢	Both schoolbased and afterschool dance instructors administer dance skills tests and written tests and complete formal studio observations to determine studentsâ€™ improvement in dance skills and achievement of standards and programmatic goals and objectives (terminology, social skills/behavior, etc.)





<p>As we scale up capacity of the teacher training program, we ultimately will seek funding for a formal evaluation of the teacher training program and tracking of outcomes at participantsâ€™ schools, though in the interim, during the term of this grant, we will survey teacher participants (pre, post and followup) regarding the efficacy of our workshops, materials and impact on their students.</p>


","â€œElementary instruction designated specifically for dance . . . is fast becoming an endangered species.â€   Erik W. Robelen, â€œNo Obituary Needed for Arts Education, Study Reveals.â€ Education Week, April 11, 2012 (summarizing federal study on K12 arts education).





While the LA2050 report notes the relative strength of the arts in LA currently, a critical weakness is identified in the programs (or lack thereof) provided in our public elementary and middle schools.  Even in schools that have managed to retain some visual arts or music programs in the face of debilitating cuts to arts education budgets, the overwhelming majority of students in grades K8 in LAUSD today receive no exposure to dance.  The LA2050 report notes that as of 2011, LAUSD employed only 250 fulltime elementary school arts teachers â€“ for more than 600 elementary schools.  We know that few, if any of these, are dance instructors.  The U.S. Department of Education recently reported that while 94% of elementary schools  offered music and 83% offered visual arts in the 200910 school year, only 3% offered dance. (danceusa.org/newsactionalerts.)  LAUSDâ€™s own Arts at the Core Resolution acknowledged the Districtâ€™s current â€œinequality and opportunity gapâ€ in arts education for youth in our City, where students in parts of the District attend schools that raise private funds to provide arts experiences for their students, while schools with predominantly Title I students have no such resources.  We aim to change that.


  


The positive impact of dance on learning and psychosocial development has been widely documented in academic research.  Dance activities support the development of fluency, originality and critical thinking skills (Deasey, 2002), improve test scores, school attendance, responsibility, selfdiscipline, and   just as importantly  an understanding of delayed gratification and work ethic (Brooks Schmitz, 1990b).  Dance helps combat the epidemic of childhood obesity  and helps counter the impact of lack of park access for our children (as reported in LA2050, just 33% of children in LA live within Â¼ mile of a park, compared to 91% in NYC and 65% in San Diego).  â€œ[The] odds of being overweight or obese increased relative to lower household income levels, less neighborhood access to parks and sidewalks, lower levels of physical activity, and more time spent watching TV or on the computer.  Black and Latino children had higher rates of obesity and greater chances of being overweight than their nonLatino white counterparts, after researchers adjusted for socioeconomic and behavioral factors, and state of residence.â€  (â€œA New Map of Childhood Obesity in the U.S.,â€ L.A. Times, May 3, 2010.)  





Expanding opportunities for children in LA to engage in quality dance education will not only impact the future of the Arts & Cultural Vitality in LA, but directly impact Education (thereby also improving Income & Employment), Health, and Social Connectedness in our City.


","<p>â€œEvery education system in the world has the same hierarchy of subjects. There isn't an education system in the world that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics . . . . Why? Why not? Children dance all the time. We all have bodies. As children grow up, we start to teach them only from the waist up.â€   Sir Ken Robinson, 2006 TED Conference Presentation</p>





<p>Our vision is that each and every child in LA is provided equitable access to developing the skills and habits of mind that will enable success in our 21st century society.  Beyond simple mastery of skills in English, math and other subject areas, todayâ€™s rapidly changing world demands that the workforce of tomorrow be prepared to face challenges we cannot predict today.  The pace of technological development and information exchange is unprecedented in human history, and skills that were essential just a generation ago have become obsolete. Critical thinking, problemsolving, analytical skills and creativity will be more important for this generation than any in recent history.  As the highly acclaimed author and speaker Sir Ken Robinson has noted, â€œCreativity is not some exotic, optional extra.  It's a strategic issue."" (Ken Robinson, Fast Company, July 5, 2011.)</p>  





<p>We believe â€“ we know â€“ that through dance and other arts, children are able to experience true joy in the learning process, building on their inherent curiosities and desire to be active learners.  While we are quite proud that some of our students have gone on to excel in programs with some of the nationâ€™s top professional dance companies, our primary goal is to use dance and the arts as a means of engaging all children in becoming selfconfident, hardworking, disciplined and motivated to excel across all areas of their lives.  Throughout our history we have demonstrated through our schoolbased, afterschool and community programs that exposure to quality dance education can have a lifelong impact on some of our Cityâ€™s most â€œatriskâ€ children.  Students who will never become professional dancers, but who will benefit from the life lessons our program imparts:  the value of perseverance in the face of setbacks, the ability to see the connection between hard work and results, and a willingness to push oneself past selfimposed limits.</p>  





<p>By making our curriculum, assessments, program structure and expert faculty available to train other teachers across LA, our vision for LA2050 is that all children in Los Angeles will have the opportunity to discover previously unknown talents, be inspired, and find a sense of belonging.</p>





<p>â€œEverybody dance! helped me unleash not only troubled emotions as a child but helped me grow both mentally and emotionally. . . .  [A]s clichÃ© as it sounds I really donâ€™t know where Iâ€™d be or what Iâ€™d be doing if I had not found out my talent and passion is dancing . . . .â€ â€“ Amaris Jacobs, 18, Pasadena City College student </p>

3102241,2013241,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/sycamoreandromaine.html,volunteers housing the homeless, Housing,"For 25 years the allvolunteer GWHFC has helped the homeless of Hollywood and West Hollywood survive life in the street by serving them a fantastic meal every night, seven nights a week, which we make entirely from highend food donated to us all over town.  With the GWHFC/UCLA Mobile Clinic, which we founded in 2001, we help them take care of their myriad medical and legal concerns.  Now, we'd like to focus on getting them OFF the street, one by one, into safe, clean, and attractive apartments of their own choosing  not public housing and not slum housing, but apartments which we wouldn't mind living in ourselves (just as the meals we serve are planned and prepared to our taste, as if we were going to eat them, not they).  Over the past 18 months we've ""housed"" twelve chronically homeless ""clients"" in that way, and we've come to realize that we are better at it than any of the dozen or so public and private agencies which use up enormous amounts of money in salary and overhead to do the same thing.  Why are we better?  Because we are volunteers, and we come to know the people we serve organically:  we meet them over a really good meal, and little by little they tell us about themselves, and we are able to figure out which of them are ready to join us back in the mainstream.  We aren't social scientists, and we aren't bureaucrats  we are a crosssection of the community much like they are, and it is no wonder that they come to trust us and we come to trust them, because they know we are doing what we do out of love for our fellow man and for no other reason. ","Having been called into being as volunteers by the City of West Hollywood in 1987, we suffered the awful realization just two years later that West Hollywood, as a political entity, wasn't ready to defend a group that was helping the homeless.  We were accused of perpetuating homelessness, encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying property values  all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a day  and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having fought city hall and survived.  From that point forward we have only gotten braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of people like us in the community who wanted to do something ""good"" but didn't know where to begin.  We have since fought any number of running battles just to keep going  against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians and other ""social service agencies,"" and, just two years ago against a company which sued us for creating ""a public and a private nuisance.""  When that happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice.  We are now stronger and more effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still.  We serve an everbetter meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night.  We have two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary.  As far as we know, no other ragtag grassroots organization formed to help the homeless has lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support.  And yet we are still at the takeoff point, in that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea as to how we can reach deeper into the community and how we can avail ourselves of its strength to do more for the weakest among us.","The US Department of Housing and Urban Development

In the latter half of the Twentieth Century political and economic systems were created ostensibly to make that happen, and it simply didn't.  Now we have another chance:  not for ideological reasons or with a view to creating yet another enforceable system, but  because there is no greater social logic than doing good for its own sake, we should all follow our instincts and pitch in.  The number of volunteers who want to join the GWHFC is growing in geometric proportions.  By 2050 will they and others like them have nothing more to do, because people will no longer be living in the street?  Not a chance.  But there is every chance that if we keep going as we are going now, we will be able to move the newly homeless off the street almost as fast as they come to it, and it will be easier to do it than it is now, because most of the community will be engaged with us in the process.  We will ALL be volunteers."
3102242,2013242,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/theheartproject.html,The HeArt Project: Arts Education ends the Dropout Crisis in LA, Education,"The HeArt Project aims to end Los Angeles' high school dropout crisis by bringing the arts and artists to 650 of the most vulnerable teenagers in Los Angeles. 





The HeArt Project leverages the resources and expertise of its partners  working artists and creative professionals, cultural centers, and colleges/universities  to offer a fourstep ""ladder"" of increasingly advanced arts opportunities to youth who otherwise would have no arts in their education. The HP ladder is: Level 1  arts workshops and student exhibitions at cultural centers; Level 2  afterschool art residencies and leadership development; Level 3  scholarships to conservatorystyle art programs for high school students on college campuses; and Level 4  mentorship, internships, and scholarships for high school graduates. Through HP's advanced programs, students connect a high school diploma with creative careers and gain the 21st century work skills and confidence to pursue these opportunities. HP also runs the arts programming at the Hollywood Media Arts Academy, launched in 2010 in partnership with the L.A. County Office of Education. 


","Started in 1992 at one site with a budget of $2,000, HP now serves 650 students in 25 school sites throughout three school districts with an operating budget of $1.2M. Our longterm arts programs reach communities and students who otherwise lack access to the arts, proven to be one of the most effective ways to engage teenagers in their education and community. Our professional artists teach realworld skills needed in todayâ€™s creative economy, and impart a sense of confidence and purpose that leads to graduating from high school with a plan for the future. 





Highlights of our recent achievements include:





Responding to an increasingly urgent need to address the high school dropout crisis, The HeArt Project partnered with the LA County Office of Education to open the Hollywood Media Arts Academy (HMAA), an alternative arts high school for students at high risk of dropping out. The Academy celebrated its 2nd anniversary in August 2012.


 


An important measure of the success is how many students advance from Level 1 to Level 2 and participate and complete HPâ€™s advanced levels. In the past two years, HP has had its largest cohorts ever participate in these advanced levels, and this year, for the first time, all Level 2 arts residency students applied for Level 3 summer arts scholarships. 





As students advance up HPâ€™s program, they continue to realize more successes in the larger community.  Since July 2012, HP students have:


Enrolled in West LA Collegeâ€™s Communications, Entertainment, and Media Arts Division in a partnership program with Hollywood CPR, an entertainment industry training program.  


Performed at REDCAT with the CalArts CAP Program


Attended Earthwatch Instituteâ€™s Los Angeles Student Fellowship Program on scholarship and studied the Diamondback Terrapin turtle in New Jersey. It was this teenagerâ€™s first time on an airplane.


Our first student was accepted into the Ryman Arts Program, a rigorous and highly selective classical arts training program for teens. 


Been accepted into the Mark Taper Forumâ€™s Young Ambassadors program





Scholarships have traditionally taken place in the summers, but this past fall, HP has an unprecedented 8 students participating in advanced programs   6 at Art Centerâ€™s Saturday High and their collegelevel program Art Center at Night; one at the Taper, one in Ryman Arts.


","Based on a partnership model of connecting students to Los Angeles through the arts, The HeArt Project has worked with nearly every major cultural institution including The Getty Center and Museum, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Museum of Contemporary Art, The Natural History Museum, UCLA, The Autry National Center, the Los Angeles Opera, SCIArc, Japanese American National Museum, The Museum of Tolerance, and The Huntington Library. Thanks to our partnerships with professional awardwinning artists from a wide range of creative practices, our students have been exposed to nearly every artistic discipline, among them painting, photography, African dance, graphic design, urban planning, assemblage, music, oral histories, fashion d","The HeArt Project uses qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate student progress and outcomes. Teaching artists, workshop coordinators, and classroom teachers provide a consistent presence during each workshop and after school residency, and are able to work together to note improvements and challenges in student performance during the workshop cycle. HP also administers an online qualitative assessment tool that was recently developed under the guidance of a professional evaluator and in collaboration with educators. The tool measures studentsâ€™ progress over time across multiple learning outcomes: social learning, aesthetic/creative learning, subjectbased/content learning, and school and community learning. These outcomes correlate with preparedness for the 21st century creative economy as well as dropout prevention risk reduction. According to this assessment, 74% of students felt that HP changed their attitude towards learning at least somewhat, and 87% felt that their participation in HP encouraged them to stay in school.  HP also tracks the number of students who participate and complete each level. ","HP is one of the only arts organizations in L.A. that works exclusively with alternative high school students. Students attend alternative high schools (continuation and community day schools) for reasons including failing grades and behavioral problems, teen pregnancy/parenting, gang involvement, expulsion from their home school districts, or prior incarceration. Most are lowincome minorities, and all are at high risk of dropping out for good. Our students have experienced high levels of transience and failure, perceive a lack of future possibilities, and have difficulty recognizing the value of their contributions and connection to others. As a result they are often unable to envision a future where they embark on fulfilling careers, feel a meaningful connection to their community, or identify and pursue substantive goals. 





We have witnessed through the years  and research in the field supports our experience  that the arts are a particularly effective mechanism to inspire hardtoreach youth. Many HP students are part of rampant cycles of poverty, gang involvement and violence that perpetuate themselves within their families and communities. HP helps students help themselves and chart a new course in life. HP students connect with professional mentors, contribute to a positive peer network, graduate high school, and pursue substantive goals. By investing in their own potential, these teenagers transform into fulfilled and responsible adults with a stake in their communities. 





HPâ€™s work is significantly underscored by a major report just recently released from the National Endowment for the Arts, â€œArts and Achievement in AtRisk Youthâ€ (2012), which compiles findings from four longitudinal studies. One example from the study is that in two separate databases, students who had artsrich experiences in high school showed higher overall GPAs than did students who lacked those experiences. And further, high school students who earned few or no arts credits were five times more likely not to have graduated than students who earned many arts credits. This significant effect of the arts on the graduation rate of atrisk teenagers mirrors what we have witnessed in our 20 years of service. 








","Success for our idea in the year 2050 would be the elimination of the high school dropout crisis, with high quality arts education being offered  to each and every student in every public and private school across Los Angeles. Success would include the placement of each and every one of the students we serve in job opportunities/internships in the creative economy. "
3102243,2013243,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LASA.html,The Los Angeles Service Academy, Social Connectedness,"<p>The Los Angeles Service Academy (LASA) begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such agencies funded? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do cultural institutions play in the life of Los Angeles? What about businesses and nonprofits? What are the potential career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin? These are among the thousands of questions that students have about the city and region in which they live. There are a million more that they would have if they knew more about place, region, and history. </p>





<p>Designed as a supplement to the regular school year, LASA provides an intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public, civic, and civil service. Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies â€“ infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise â€“ of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers. Students who successfully complete the program during the junior year are placed in internships during their senior year, and will receive assistance and mentoring in the college application process. </p>





<p>Social connectedness is at the very heart of LASAâ€™s mission. Our hope is that LASA will change the lives and career paths of hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of change and community building across the Los Angeles basin. Throughout the year, LASA places particular emphasis on making certain that participants get to know one another personally, become familiar with one anotherâ€™s region and/or neighborhood, and gain an appreciation for one anotherâ€™s goals while participating in LASA (and beyond).</p>





<p>Currently in its first full year of operation, LASA brings together a diverse and select group of 2025 students and 68 high school teachers from across the Los Angeles basin; 80% of the student participants are from public schools. The students begin their examination of Los Angeles during an intense fourday Summer Institute (scheduled for July 29th August 1 in 2013). The summer program will be followed by onceamonth sessions on Saturdays from September through May. Depending on the topic on a given day, students will gather in the morning at the Huntington Library or at the Central Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. Each session will focus on a particular theme or module and will be guided by experts on the given topic. In 20132014, the topics will include water, transportation, business, local and county governance, business, museums and cultural institutions, sports and entertainment, downtown, the LA River, police and criminal justice, food and housing, and the harbor complex. </p>





<p>Utilizing the astonishing archival resources of the Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library, LASA will teach students about the historical growth of Los Angeles from the midnineteenth century forward. We will work from shared seminar readings (â€œhomeworkâ€ will be kept to a minimum), draw archival resources and personnel into our discussions, and build a collaborative working knowledge of Los Angeles history.</p>





<p>Our seminars will be but step one of a twostep process as our work â€œin the classroomâ€ will be supplemented by fieldwork. For example, our investigation of the history of Los Angeles water resources and water engineering will start from indepth study of regional water history, hydrology, and the many interfaces between water history and water politics. On that same afternoon, LASA will visit one or more key water facilities in order to have firsthand and practical knowledge as to contemporary water issues in the greater Los Angeles Basin. During the past year, for instance, and again with reference to water, LASA visited the Metropolitan Water Districtâ€™s Weymouth Treatment Plant in Azusa and the San Gabriel Dam. Future site visits might include Hansen Dam or the LADWPâ€™s Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant. In all site visits, LASA participants meet with key personnel who are in a position to contribute to our discussions and investigations.</p>





<p>The academic and investigative part of LASA takes place during the junior year. For those students who faithfully attend and take part in the required number of monthly meetings, LASA will facilitate internships during the senior year in collaboration with Leadership LA, the nonprofit arm of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, whose alumni work in agencies and institutions across the entire region.</p>","<p>LASA has been active since the summer of 2012. Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different ""node"" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development  with rare documents  and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles.  For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region.  Following an onfoot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with reimagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day).  A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an endoftheday Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times.  </p>





<p>We believe our LASA students are getting to know the region, getting to know one another, and beginning to build lasting ties to their home and one another through LASA's commitment to fostering   engaged civic participation and civic education.  We believe that we are off to a great start.</p>","<p>LASA is directly partnered with the Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library.  Leadership LA, the nonprofit arm of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, provides assistance in coordinating internship placements for LASA students during the senior year.</p>





<p>In addition, LASA works closely with institutions helping facilitate our exploration of regional infrastructure.  In 20122013, LASA has visited, or will visit, Los Angeles City Hall, Warner Brothers Studios, the Metropolitan Water District's Weymouth Treatment Plant, the Glenair Corporation, LAPD headquarters, Union Station, Mudtown Farms in Watts, the Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, Disney Hall, the harbor complex, and LACMA.</p>","Our metrics for success will include both simple and complex measures.  In the short term, can we show that LASA expands its service year to year?  Can we build more partnerships with more schools, more teachers, more students, and more institutions?  Can we facilitate student interest in moving on to collegiate education, and can we bring important collegesuccess tools and strategies to the students?  We can, and will, track these issues by reference to each student and each student's postLASA trajectory.





On a more complicated level, can we foster bonds of commonality, community, and connectedness between and among our diverse group(s) of students and teachers?  Will friendships develop across region, background, or socioeconomic status which help bridge the distances and differences in Los Angeles?  Although tracking such issues or such progress will be difficult, we expect to monitor these aspects of LASA success by way of careful attention paid to student goals, student progress, and student evaluations.





Much farther out, can we say  eventually  that LASA has fostered bonds of connection and community which serve to make Los Angeles more efficient and more humane when LASA graduates enter the workforce in civil, civil, and other service to our region?","<p>LASA inspires young people to think about their region and their future and how these are intertwined.  We aim to foster ties of community and connection between diverse groups of teenagers as we collectively explore how greater Los Angeles works.  Along the way, we will offer assistance to those students by way of collegiate counseling and mentoring internships across the basin.  Our LASA graduates will have foundational understanding of Los Angeles history and institutions as they move on in their education and into career paths.  By maintaining connections to one another and to what we learn together, LASA students and graduates will create new and lasting ties across region and background, ties which we hope will grow as LASA grows and as our student participants move into positions of public service in their lives and careers.</p>





<p>LASA aims to change the lives of its student participants and, in so doing, change the future of Los Angeles for the better.</p>","<p>2050 is a long ways away.  But LASA is, in part, aimed precisely at that future.  37 years from now, can we point to a large body of LASA graduates?  More schools, more students, more teachers, more partnerships  all serving to draw together regional ties of connection, education, and community?  </p>





<p>Most exciting, can we look to a Los Angeles of 2050 in which LASA students have entered the realms of civil and civic service (professionally or otherwise) and can they, through the bonds established when they were much younger, find innovative ways to work together and to communicate beyond the challenges of size and metropolitan complexity?  Can LASA help pull our region together in common pursuit of the public good?</p>"
3102244,2013244,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/thelakitchen.html,L.A. Kitchen: Neither Food or People Should Ever Go to Waste, Social Connectedness,"<p>â€˜Charity is about the redemption of the giver, not the liberation of the receiver.â€™</p>





<p>Each of us has experienced the power of food to bring people together; whether through the intergenerational passing down of recipes and techniques, serving the less fortunate, or even around our own kitchen tables. But when it comes to helping people who are hungry, our systems are plagued by fragmentation, reinforcing models that perpetuate the kind of dependency that make breaking these cycles impossible. This antiquated model is inequitable ineffective and has more of a lasting impact on the â€˜giverâ€™ than the â€˜receiver.â€™ The new L.A. Kitchen is at the heart of an innovative approach, a transformative model that uses the universal power of food to foster volunteerism, civic and social engagement, and voting. </p>





<p>First, we will recruit diverse L.A. residents to volunteer and join us in our commercial kitchen and produce processing hub, renewing raw fruits and vegetables into â€œstrongâ€ meals and nutritious snacks. Once there, volunteers will find incredibly real, rewarding work to be done. Very often, these perfectly edible items are discarded by farmers because they donâ€™t appeal to a mass, privileged market; but thanks to L.A. Kitchen, they will be recombined as nutrientrich, dignified fuel for hungry and atrisk individuals. While some of our volunteers will be the recognizable, middleclass dogooders whose generosity currently supports nonprofits across the city, older adults who want to stay active and engaged and students from local high schools and universities seeking service hours will be a huge part of our mission, turning our kitchen into a gathering place and classroom. Everyone has a role to play and job to do at the L.A. Kitchen, and all are welcome!</p>





<p>Volunteers wonâ€™t be the only ones standing in our production line. At their side will be young men and women aging out of the foster care system and formerly incarcerated adults. These seemingly unlikelypaired groups will be enrolled in a pioneering threemonth jobtraining program, allowing them to develop real culinary skills, while simultaneously mentoring one other & enriching the community. </p>





<p>Volunteers will interact on a human level with the very people they thought they would be serving, and together, they will nourish Los Angeles on a new level and be challenged to a degree that personal paradigms will shift. Both groups will be guided through the daily process by L.A. Kitchen staff, and most will have completed the rigorous culinary curriculum and earn living wages.</p>





<p>Once weâ€™ve humanized hunger and joblessness in the minds of our volunteers, we will expose them to the true power of their dollars and their votes. </p>





<p>As consumers, each of us possesses great power. â€œStrong Food,â€ L.A. Kitchenâ€™s dynamic social enterprise, will provide highquality, nutritious items through responsible sourcing and fair employment practices, allowing everyday people to support our charitable work by purchasing our products. We believe in breaking down the obsolete barrier between .coms and .orgs. (forprofits and nonprofits), and L.A. Kitchen will provide the topquality skills and services expected of a forprofit with the social impact of a nonprofit. As volunteers, L.A. residents can contribute their time and see meaningful impact as a result. As customers, they can spend their dollars and see the same. We will prove that living wages, an encouraging work environment, quality benefits, and financial transparency are not detractors from a companyâ€™s bottom line; they are some of its greatest champions.</p>





<p>Unlike too many nonprofits, L.A. Kitchen is unafraid of political action. Todayâ€™s leaders are paralyzed between the false choice of providing public good and creating private sector jobs. The L.A. Kitchen promotes a new civic currency, insisting that both are essential to generating profit and maintaining a civil society. </p>





<p>Employing foster care graduates and exoffenders is cheaper than reincarcerating them; recovering surplus food is smarter than throwing it away; giving our seniors healthy meals is less costly & more effective than loading them up with prescriptions. Engaging volunteers and utilizing their professional skills is smarter than having them paint shelter walls over and over again.</p>





<p>Humantohuman interaction, facilitated by food & fueled by social enterprise, grounded in empathy & dedicated to justice will unite Los Angeles around an inclusive vision for a healthier, more prosperous community. </p>","L.A. Kitchen is brand new. Many of its core ideas have been proven successful â€“ though, never quite in this dynamic combination. L.A. Kitchen is the latest venture of Robert Egger, the author of the award winning book â€œBegging for Change, The Dollars and Sense of Making Nonprofits Responsive, Efficient and Rewarding for Allâ€ and the pioneering creator of D.C. Central Kitchen, The Campus Kitchens Project, and CForward.





D.C. Central Kitchen, founded in Washington, D.C. in 1989, is now a thriving $11 million nonprofit with a $6 million social enterprise portfolio. Egger created DCCK to turn leftover food into balanced meals in a â€˜central kitchenâ€™ that could in turn deliver them to 100 other nonprofits that were spending too much for substandard meals. There, he launched a culinary training program that brought in some of the cityâ€™s toughest cases â€“ men and women written off as hopeless, helpless, or both â€“ and prepared them for lasting careers. Since 2008, DCCKâ€™s 370 culinary graduates have averaged a job placement rate of 90%, despite the weak economy, and are 96% less likely to return to prison than exoffenders nationwide. Eggerâ€™s results inspire 14,000 individuals to contribute their time and effort as volunteers to DC Central Kitchen each year.





Egger launched The Campus Kitchens Project in 2001, because he saw a generation of young people dedicated to community service, but few nonprofits capable of maximizing their tremendous potential. Today, there are 34 CKP sites in 20 states across America, led by 5,000 tireless student volunteers who turned idle college and high school dining halls and cafeteria leftovers into new tools in the fight against hunger. In addition to preparing meals, CKP is preparing a new generation of community leaders. In 2012, 45% of CKPâ€™s student volunteers reported that their experiences had changed their entire career path, opening their eyes to new needs and new opportunities. 





His work in Washington earned him numerous accolades and awards, including being named an Oprah Angel, the James Beard Humanitarian of the Year and a Washingtonian of the Year.





In 2006, Egger CoConvened the first Nonprofit Congress, and in 2011, he launched CForward, Americaâ€™s first Political Action Committee for nonprofits. Nonprofits comprise 10% of the US economy and 10% of the American workforce, but they speak with no common voice in our electoral process. In 2012, CForward made history by endorsing 8 candidates, representing both major parties, who had strong, clear plans for strengthening nonprofits and their role in solving key problems. Most won. This work also earned him a spot on the â€œTop 50 Most Influential Nonprofit leadersâ€ four years in a row.





Now, Eggerâ€™s energy, experience, and entrepreneurial spirit are here in the region where he grew up in the 1960â€™s and 70â€™s, with an added focus on fighting the needless waste of fresh produce and strengthening our senior citizens. Itâ€™s time for change.


","St. Vincentâ€™s Meals on Wheels, EngAge and AARPCA know the unique needs of our cityâ€™s senior citizens well, and we have forged exciting partnerships that allows for direct outreach to L.A.â€™s elders.





We will build on the job readiness programming provided by programs like our partner Chrysalis, as well as programs that focus on supporting emancipating foster youth and returning felons.





We will provide student volunteers with service hour opportunities & nutrition education, which will make the LA Kitchen a dynamic partner for LAUSD.





We will work with Central Valley farmers, chefs, and the UCLA Arts and Healing Center to develop recipes that will pioneer the â€œfood as medicineâ€ movement. 


","Old metrics that have defined â€˜successâ€™ in the nonprofit sectorâ€“meals prepared, clients served, expenditure on overheadâ€“are as tired as the solutions they claim to measure. We believe in integrated metrics to show valuable synergies between programmatic activities.





First, we will push back against the status quo of measuring impact based on â€œpounds moved or agencies served.â€ Big does not equal good, and L.A. Kitchen will pioneer measuring the nutritional content of what we serve. We will partner with local medical schools & nutritionists to develop metrics that can quantify the medicinal / health impacts of the meals we serve. This will shatter the typical way we measure the impact of â€œhungerâ€ programs and incentivize a new way for foundation officers and regular people to understand which programs are making people strong, versus those who are endangering peopleâ€™s health in the name of feeding them.





Second, we will assess the impact of our dynamic approach to volunteer engagement. By building a base of strategically managed senior citizen volunteers, we will generate more than free labor. We will reimagine the way nonprofits measure the value of volunteers by extending that value to the tangible benefits provided to volunteers themselves. By offering physical activity and intergenerational engagement opportunities (mentoring to atrisk / younger individuals), our senior citizens will lead healthier, more connected lives. And by actively recruiting the potentially isolated seniors who rely on L.A. Kitchen meals and nutritional items to volunteer in our kitchen, we will be energizing individuals, who in turn bring that energy to a meaningful outlet of community service. Giving seniors a place to reinvest all they know and have experienced will produce costeffective â€“ & actually effective â€“ mentoring and social support services for atrisk populations, including exoffenders and emancipated youth. The interplay between qualitative resultsâ€“changes in perceptions, reported shifts in behaviorâ€“and quantitative ones â€“ hours of community service among marginalized populations, vitamin intake among seniors, and reduced recidivism â€“ will tell a far more compelling story than either form of evaluation alone.





Finally, we will capture changes in voting & political behavior. In partnership with the nonprofit sectorâ€™s PAC, CForward, we will track increased nonprofit activity in the electoral process through social media & lobbying activities, while surveying individual nonprofit workers & volunteers about their perceptions of the role of nonprofits. In time, the many rating systems for charities, which claim to address questions of effectiveness and fiscal responsibility, should change their approaches on savvy business techniques, quality job creation and strategic, nonpartisan political activity as vital indicators of a thoughtful, wellbuilt nonprofit organization, & our success in effecting such change will be a vital indicator of our continued work. "," empower older Los Angelenos, those not returning to prison because of participation in our program, and foster youth who will avoid their anticipated cycle of lifelong systemliving


 use healthy food to offer meaningful volunteer opportunities


 unite diverse populations in the battles against hunger and poor health 


 help the city redefine aging, making LA more whole, freeing up resources used to address declining health and prison terms, and redistributing it in much more impacting ways





Too many volunteer experiences achieve little for those purportedly being served. Our efforts to train atrisk members of our community for decent jobs mean we are pulling men and women out of the service line & empowering them to be part of the solution. Volunteers will see that transformation in action, and demand similar accountability and results from all their community service activities. Financial donors demand detailed accounting and transparency; nonprofits owe volunteers the same respect when they give their time and labor.





Second, we will bring together a diverse group of L.A. residents to fight hunger together. We will place special emphasis on recruiting and leveraging older volunteers, men and women eager to redefine retirement. LAK will engage thousands of these experienced community members each year, empowering them to remain active and involved as they grow older. 





Our intergenerational approach will unite our elders with atrisk youth, especially those in the foster care system. We will also offer a meaningful mentoring program that is specially geared toward preventing destructive, shortsighted behaviors and negative outcomes among foster youth. Many of these mentors will be fellow trainees, men and women returning from years in prison who made the mistakes and learned the lessons the hard way. We will empower men and women who have turned their lives around to counsel and coach young people about the key decisions involved in avoiding prison and addiction. In turn, the younger men and women will help older trainees transition into the cyberworld of today. 





Helping any one of these populations is valuable. Helping them to help one another is visionary.





Third, we will engineer a change in business practices and political debates by educating and engaging individuals as consumers and voters after they come to us as volunteers. The success of our social enterprises will empower nonprofits to launch new enterprises and inspire forprofits to change their approach. When consumers understand the full costs of substandard wages and lowquality food products, the competitive balance of the marketplace will shift. Similarly, individuals will have a new understanding of the vital role nonprofits do and must play in political debates and policy solutions if we are to meet the challenges of this century. We will be nonpartisan, but not nonpolitical. ","Our vision for Los Angeles in 2050: our city will unite individuals of different generations, cultures, and tax brackets to make engagement, volunteerism, voting, and responsible business practices essential components of our daily life.





For a town that worships youthfulness, the notion that we can make it a hub for the redefinition of aging might seem unrealistic, but this is at the core of the L.A. Kitchen experiment. Given the extra years that science is affording us, it is economically essential that older Americans live at home and stay productive for as long as possible. We must develop programs, establish metrics and elect officials to make that a reality NOW, not in 10, 20 or 50 years.





It may be strange for an organization that will focus on strengthening senior citizens to speak so boldly about a future nearly fifty years away. But if youâ€™re a young adult reading this today, youâ€™ll likely be a senior citizen in 2050. We want senior citizens to be valued, treasured citizens, and to see their later years as a new opportunity to connect to their communities. We will prove that our model of intergenerational service and engagement will empower seniors to live healthier, more active lives while sharing meaningful knowledge with fellow residents. 





We will reveal the economic power of keeping our older citizens engaged and respected. Redefining aging, while also providing healthy meals, will have a huge impact on the cityâ€™s treasury and its ability to invest money in its schools, parks and other community enhancing initiatives. 





LA Kitchen believes that organizations should treat volunteers like any foundation officer or donor, and provide reporting on the impact, value, and longterm results of their contribution in the lives of those it serves and the community we share. We believe that increased transparency among nonprofits will inspire active engagement among volunteers, donors, and other community stakeholders, as they hold nonprofits like L.A. Kitchen to account, demanding that we make the most of our available resources and constantly innovate in service of our community.





We also envision a future where missiondriven nonprofits are unafraid to act politically. It isnâ€™t a violation of tax laws to educate lawmakers, inspire voters, or speak truth to power. Rather, doing those things is an inherent part of what a valuesoriented organization must do to earn its taxexempt status. In our vision, nonprofits, public sector agencies, and forprofit actors all have equal seats at the decisionmaking table as we devise shared solutions to our common problems. 





Finally, we seek a future where for and nonprofits alike behave responsibly in their business practices. Americanmade products, living wages, and preventative health care must be part of any viable business model. Accountability among employers will inspire harderworking employees, increased worker productivity, and profits that ultimately fuel growth & development in Los Angeles."
3102245,2013245,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/RXforLA.html,An Rx for LA  Combining Art & Technology to ReBuild Los Angeles, Income & Employment,"Our idea is to expand an existing program that has created dozens of new businesses and hundreds of new jobs â€“ while helping revitalize an entire neighborhood  and attracting over 150 new businesses and working creative individuals â€“ all without one dollar of public funds.


An RX for Los Angeles will take what one person working with the assistance of dozens of different community members on each project  accomplished in Downtown and to now expand that program's scope in DTLA and then the reach out to the rest of Los Angeles.  So rather than it being a program to get one LA business to move to another part of LA â€“ or competing with programs offering financing from the same pot of money or promoting facade improvement grants  RXforLA will look at the needs of each geographic area and the needs of each of the different major business categories (fashion, film, tech, small retail stores, food) to see what is working or not working.  Concurrently,  the different creative and tech industries are also examined to see how each of them might help any of these projects.  And, finally, each potential solution will also be examined by how it might impact any of LA's other indicators.  


Now this may sound complicated, but there are those who quickly learn how to think in this way â€“ and having multiple eyes look at each deal also makes it easier.  It also helps that  at times  the more constraints you haveâ€“ the easier it might be to see the one thing that will work best.  It also helps that we have a team of serial entrepreneurs  who have started multiple businesses and have experienced just about everything that can happen.  


The program's initial expansion will be to target specific social and industry wide problems within Downtown  â€“ and then follow that with looking at specific industries & social problems outside of the greater Downtown area.  These focuses will make it easier to judge the results outside of the Downtown area.


And now for a successful example of the process.  When the Last Bookstore opened its vastly expanded space at 5th & Spring, the newspapers were filled with all the local bookstores closing  new, vintage and even antiquarian bookstores.  They were closing due to not just AMAZON discounting new books but because AMAZON was also selling other peopleâ€™s used books  as were online booksellersâ€™ abebooks and eBay.  But after researching those challenges â€“ and making the necessary business â€“ and artistic  decisions, the store was profitable from the day it opened.  And the fact the store has expanded twice within a year after it opened â€“ is no accident.


The plan was developed by store owner Josh Spencer and  supported by the person who leased him the space â€“ Brady Westwater, who started RXforLA , after he helped negotiated a lease  structured to make it financially possible for the store to first open â€“ and then be able to expand.  And â€“ again â€“ none of this this was a fluke or an accident.  It was all planned


And it has also fulfilled two other markers.  It has created not only a far connected local community, but a regionally connected larger arts community that didnâ€™t exist before from all over Southern California.  And again â€“ this was no accident â€“ it was all planned from the very beginning.  





Lastly old store  7 employees,  new store  27 employees.





Turning to fashion, we have team members who run some of the leading LA Fashion Week shows for LA designers but, unfortunately, most designers donâ€™t do shows in LA because our fashion week seems to be thrown together at the last minute â€“  spread out all over town, in multiple venues on different days â€“ and that makes it impossible to attract the buyers and critics who attend New York's Fashion Week. 


So everyone is finally askingâ€“ why canâ€™t we all show under one big umbrella in one place with one set of dates?  But for that to happen â€“  planning would need to start now  to select a site and dates and then start to promote the hell out of the fact that LA will â€“ finally â€“ get its act together and try and have a real fashion week.  RXforLAT, if it is successful in getting the grant,  will develop a site promoting the major cultural industries of Los Angeles â€“ a single place where people from around the world can come and see what is being planned.  And once that site is launched â€“  it will be a lot easier for the different producers of Fashion Week to agree upon dates and venues â€“ since once everyone agrees to lock them down â€“ then a serous effort can be made to lure buyers and critics from New York â€“ and many other cities  to LA Fashion Week.  





But first we need to create that infrastructure and even then   it wonâ€™t happen over night, But it needs to start somewhere â€“ and it needs to start â€“ now.  And to accomplish even just that â€“ would be a huge win this fall for LA2050.


","The RXforLA program is an expansion Brady Wastewaterâ€™s long work with a wide variety of stakeholders in DTLA.  Since moving there full time, he was a founding member of Downtown LA Neighborhood Council where served as both president & VP.  He also recruited the founders of Gallery Row, Nic Cha Kim and Kjell Hagen to DLANC and worked with them and Art Walk founder Bert Green with their projects since their inceptions and leased the majority of the first galleries on Gallery Row. He also helped start â€“ and was president of LANCC  a citywide Neighborhood Council organization and he was one of the five members of the DWP MOU Committee that negotiated the first MOU with a City Agency.


 Since then. he as leased  (at no charge or helped create â€“ over 150 different creative businesses or individual artists studios and when he saw the need for local fashion designers to show at reasonable rates, he organized two major Fashion Week Shows â€“ first BOXeight â€“ and now CONEPTU Fashion Week â€“with only six weeks notice. 


He has also searched out individuals he felt would be successful in Downtown and convinced them first to move here â€“ and then to opens businesses.  He also helped Downtown residents sell their art or their other products during Art Walk and then leased them stores.  He also convinced online sellers â€“ such as THE LAST BOOKSTORE â€“ to open physical spaces and convinced brick and mortar stores to do more sales online.


When he read the Company of Angels lost its lease and was having a garage sale of all their equipment  he found them a new space 24 hours later and over the years, he helped over 50 homeless individuals find their way off the streets.


","Among our partners are the over 100 community members who have helped or worked with over the past decade.  It also includes institutions such as Gallery Row, Spring Arts Tower, the Los Angeles and the Palace Theatres, The Industry Opera group, Poor Dog Theater Company, Skin Graft, the HDBID and Bringing Back Broadway.","First, we are somewhat unusual in that we have already been very successful with our project   more successful in generating new businesses than any other economic development organization  even with six and seven figure budgets in our market area.





So for a start we will take a baseline survey of our core market area and gather what statistics we can about the various local industries.   We will also monitor all of our new contacts to determine how many of them we convert to being 'clients'.





And each of our many individual projects will also need a base line to be determined at the start so that there will be something to compare the later results with. ","One of our fashion projects is working with groups and individuals who are trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to LA.  They are either setting up or working with existing groups of workers so that not matter or how large  or how small a job is  and no matter what skill that job will require  any designer will be able to get affordable quality work done.  This helps make up for all the lesser skilled jobs LA has lost over the years by creating higher skilled and higher paying jobs.





Live Broadway theater is the number on tourist draw in New York  and it is now the only one of the major performing arts that has continued to grow both in grosses and in audience. 





That is why one of our goals is to help develop a major theater district between the theaters in Downtown Los Angeles and  joined by the Red Line  the theaters of Hollywood and North Hollywood. And besides the billion dollars that New York reaps every year from the theater industry  it also creates more film and TV jobs in New York.  Live theater makes New York  and London  the only cities where an actor, director, or writer can have a major theatrical and film or TV career  concurrently. And it is one of the many reasons why LA is losing so much of the film and TV industry to New York.





That's why we are working to assist all levels of the theatrical community from 49 and 99 seat equity waiver theaters to successfully finding tenants for existing DTLA theaters to working to create a major international  theater festival to helping develop technological advances that could change the future of live entertainment forever.  It's also why we have supported the Festival of New American Musicals and our new contemporary opera company  The Industry   since their inceptions.  A strong live theater community is essential to the long term health of  two of our largest existing industries  film & TV and tourism.


",The simple answer would be a Los Angeles that was as economically healthy as it once was.  The more complex answer would be enough good paying jobs for everyone who wants a job  to be able to get one  and a business climate that supports and rewards business.  Going much beyond that would require far more space to properly discuss.
3102246,2013246,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Gardens.html,Gardens Gardens  Everywhere!, Environmental Quality,"The Learning Garden wants to build a garden at every school, church, empty lot, public library, traffic median and every home in Los Angeles.   Over the ten years as one of the most vibrant school and community gardens in Los Angeles, The Learning Garden has learned that a garden is not just a place that grows wonderful organic fresh food which brings people to good health.   It is not just a place that grows medicinal herbs which not only cure illness but teach health care practitioners how and why each plant creates health in people.   It is not just a place where school children are exposed to nature, the knowledge of how to grow their own food, and learn about careers in nutrition, horticulture, science, art and ecology.   It is not just a place where people learn to grow their own cotton and flax, dye plants and the traditional art techniques to create both utile and artistic materials.   It is not just a place to save seeds from heirloom foods that are becoming extinct, helping to save our biodiversity.  It is not just a place that beautifies a neighborhood, adds oxygen to our air and reduces waste.  A garden is also a place that brings people together and even more profound â€“ connects them to the earth.   Itâ€™s a place to celebrate each other â€“ to share both knowledge and food  a place of â€œcommon groundâ€ for young and old, rich and poor, men and women â€“ a place that enriches the quality of life on every level. 


While we chose the Indicator of Environmental quality, this project also impacts education, arts and cultural vitality, health, and social connectedness.  The mission of The Learning Garden is to bring back that connectedness to nature, and teach people the importance of plants in our lives.   By creating an outdoor learning center in an underutilized area of Venice High School, The Learning Garden offers handson education in horticulture, permaculture, herbology, botany, nutrition, art, photography, and environmental science to students and community.   It not only beautifies the community, but offers a place of peace and serenity in an often turbulent â€œconcretedâ€ world.


In the ten years of existence, The Learning Garden has been instrumental in starting gardens in many other LAUSD schools by offering teacher training, workshops, starter plants, mulch and wood chips and volunteers.    Seeing amazing results, not only in the creation of gardens, but in the creation of supportive communities within our city, we now want more gardens in our city.


Gardens, Gardens Everywhere is a project to make that happen.   With the funding we would receive from Good, we will facilitate the installation of a minimum of 10 gardens in interested communities throughout the city.  We will train project leaders to assist communities to build what THEY need in their community, offering classes, supplies, seeds, mulch, plants and helping them find their community volunteers and local businesses.    We will ask that groups fill out a questionnaire, commit to the project and to training and get a minimum of 20 people involved.   We will offer free monthly classes to inspire the participants what needs to be done each month.  We will supply tools for big work days and give each group funds for tools of their own.   We will supply mulch, compost, seedlings, seeds, trees, and workday food and water.   We will offer lifetime memberships to the Seed Library of Los Angeles so they will have access to nonGMO open pollinated seeds for their gardens.


A project manager, together with the board of The Learning Garden, will design the application process, and criteria on which projects are chosen.   The project manager will also design the protocols of the lending tool library and all forms, and be responsible for the inventory.    A â€œpropagation crewâ€ will be hired to start seeds, transplant, propagate cuttings, graft trees, to create a huge resource of plant materials for the new gardens.   Any participant will be able to â€œinternâ€ with the propagation crew to learn how to do this for their own garden.   A monthly class will be offered for all participants, and will be taught what to do in the garden that month, with hands on learning, and opportunity to have their specific questions answered by a highly respected horticulturist.    Each project will have its own project leader who will guide them in the design, implementation and sustainability of the garden.  


We will also work with Good Karma Gardens, a payitforward operation that starts gardens in individualâ€™s homes, whether in their yard, on their patio or roof.   The recipient of their labor would be expected to help install someone elseâ€™s garden in the near future.   Again, all individuals will be offered free monthly classes, and membership to the Seed Library of Los Angeles.   Good Karma Gardens will have access to the Lending Tool Library, seed, mulch, chips and plants, and a working fund for water and refreshments for work days. ","The most important achievement of The Learning Garden is the continual growth of programs and gardens it has inspired over the past ten years.   With very little funding, The Learning Garden has demonstrated the true meaning of sustainability through community spirit and volunteerism.    Over 250 high school students a year are trained in organic horticulture, and many have pursued careers in horticulture related fields.  In our Seed to Sale program, students learn the process from planting to harvesting to selling at the local Farmers Market.    Our art students regularly use the garden to draw and paint. The science classes are out in the compost piles learning the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.


We have inspired and supported gardens at many of our feeder schools so that garden curriculum is developing from Kindergarten thru High School.  


The Learning Garden has one of the most extensive Chinese Medicinal gardens in the country and our local Traditional Chinese Medicine schools are trained from seed to harvest to medicinal use at our garden by world experts.   Our Native Californian and Succulent gardens are works of beauty and an example for homeowner to strive for in water wise gardening. This year, our Natural Arts Garden is in the process of being installed and will be home for classes in weaving, dying, painting, all with natural fibers and dyes.    Upcoming plans include simple designs for water catchment and water gardens as demonstration for homeowners to emulate.    We offer classes through UCLA extension and the UC Davis Master Garden programs, as well as our own Victory Garden classes and regular gardening, tai chi, chi gong and cooking classes.   The Learning Garden works with organizations such as Occupy Venice and Sivananda Yoga to make sure that all extra food goes to those in need.   


Our community events, including the Spring Equinox Celebration, the July 4th Ice Cream Social (with ice cream made from the garden), Pesto Day (our garlic and basil whipped into a heavenly meal) and our Winter Solstice all bring together our community in celebration.    We also sponsor, with Transition Mar Vista/Venice, a 100 Mile Meal, stressing the importance of eating locally.  Most important, our weekly potlucks create a regular and safe place for people of all kinds to join together to share their garden foods.  





","The Learning Garden partners with many organizations and will promote this project through all its venues.  For this project, we will work with SLOLA, Transition Towns, Tree People and Good Karma Gardens.   The Seed Library of Los Angeles will supply seeds for the seedlings as well as seeds for the gardens directly.   Good Karma Gardens will supervise the installation of individual gardens.  We will work with the Transition groups to offer reskilling and repurposing workshops, Little Free Library builds, cooking and canning classes, and other interests.    We will contact Tree People for large tree donations and Better for help with water catchment designs.  We will create contacts with local businesses in each area for additional support.","The first measure of success would be the physical completion of 10 garden projects throughout the city.   Each project leader will document the process and participants will be asked to write about their experience in the process.    A blog page on The Learning Garden website will be created for each garden to document ongoing progress.    The true measure of success will be the yearly reports and stories of the effect the garden has on its community, and the programs and other gardens it inspires.","The building of neighborhood gardens in the vastness of Los Angeles will help the city in many ways.  We have learned over the last ten years that a garden that is shared by community and students builds a strong support system.    It beautifies the city, creating green lush food and flower gardens, adding trees and community gathering areas.   Growing and eating locally helps the ecology, reduces the carbon footprint, reduces excess trash, and creates healthier individuals.  Most importantly, it creates community;   a garden has no limits as to age, race, gender, creed, culture or color, or economic status.  A garden brings together people at an equal level to work together and develop trust and support.   It reconnects people to each other, making our city rich in positive relationships working toward the good of the community, not just the individual.   It will bring educational opportunities to schools , churches and neighborhoods.    Each garden will exemplify the culture of the community around it and the network of gardens will share knowledge across the city to each other.


","Imagine a Los Angeles of the future with gardens on every block, in every school, church, office building, roof top  everywhere!  Gardens which are rich in food and beauty bringing nature back into everyoneâ€™s lives   how could this not be good?   Communities will be brought together with the common goal of growing food, herbs and flowers that will benefit their own neighborhoods.   Eating local will be as local as it can be which benefits our ecology in so many ways:  reducing traffic, oil consumption, the carbon foot print and adding oxygen into the air.  People will be healthier from eating fresh organic produce and working the land in their spare time.  Our retired and elderly will have purpose, as well as a community that supports them.  People in need will have access to fresh food and herbs.  Our children will learn through the garden â€“ science, art, nutrition, ecology, respect for nature and community,  naturally and profoundly. And the most important thing that we have found â€“ people will connect to each other and resilient communities will evolve.    Resilience is the quality that will see us through all that may face us in 2050, whether due to climate change, peak oil results, earthquakes and fires, economic collapse, or anything that will challenge us as a people.    At The Learning Garden, we have seen remarkable changes in ten years.  We can only imagine what the next 37 could manifest if we start now.

3102247,2013247,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/school_fuel.html,School Fuel  Tackling Childhood Obesity in the Los Angeles Unified School District, Health,"<p>Nowhere is the future of LA Countyâ€™s health more at stake than in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  According to the California Physical Fitness Report, over half of the students tested in LAUSD, the nationâ€™s second largest school district, are considered to be overweight.  Health officials universally consider childhood obesity to be the most important indicator of increased future health risks, especially chronic disease, and mortality & morbidity.</p>





<p>Now, imagine the ability to reverse the trend of childhood obesity in L.A.  Imagine in the year 2050, that heart disease, lung cancer, strokes, and liver disease are no longer the leading causes of premature death in Los Angeles. </p> 





<p>Now imagine every student in LAUSD from today through 2050 acquiring the education, knowledge, and habits through participation in our School Fuel Program to live a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.  Working together with LAUSD, the School Fuel program has the ability to create this change and alter the trajectory of health indicators for LA County.  School Fuel will equip 2.5 million future Angelenos, every L.A. city public school student from now to 2050, with the habits to live healthier.   </p>





<p>OUR IDEA:


The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education, LAUSD and nine partners are tackling the LA health  challenge headon through School Fuel.  By changing the way every LAUSD student starts their day and learns about nutrition, health and wellness, School Fuel addresses our cityâ€™s childhood obesity epidemic.  The program has two components.  First, School Fuel ensures that over half a million LAUSD students will receive a nutritious start to every day by serving students breakfast in the classroom after the bell.  Second, an integrated health and wellness campaign will be incorporated into the breakfast packaging to educate students on how to make healthy choices regarding nutrition and lifestyles.  </p>





<p>Through School Fuel, each of the Districtâ€™s more than 300,000 elementary students and a significant portion of the more than 350,000 secondary students will receive breakfast in the classroom.  Breakfasts will be delivered directly to the classroom, where students and teachers spend the first 10 minutes of the school day eating breakfast together.  During these 10 minutes of communal time, students and teachers will build a familial learning community.  At some secondary schools, students will â€œgrabâ€ their breakfasts and â€œgoâ€ to class in the â€œGrab nâ€™ Goâ€ model with new breakfast kiosks on campus making it convenient and attractive for students.   </p>





<p>Perhaps the most innovative part of School Fuel will be the integrated healthy habits campaign that utilizes all parts of the breakfast as a platform for teaching students about the importance of food, nutrition and healthy lifestyles.  For years, consumer food companies have used colorful and distinctive food packaging to market unhealthy snacks to minors.  From Capâ€™n CrunchÂ® to Chester the Cheetah,Â® children have been conditioned to respond to these powerful brands.  School Fuel takes the same concept, but applies it to the LAUSD breakfast program with the goal of educating students.  School Fuel branded food trays, milk cartons, and other packaged goods will be introduced to all LAUSD students beginning in the 2013 school year.  By leveraging the Districtâ€™s purchasing power and existing vendor relationships, the bulk of the cost to transform the packaging of all the breakfast items into vehicles for health and nutrition education is born by District suppliers.  Our initial estimates that School Fuel will deliver at least 50 million health education impressions to LAUSD students annually.  Building on this base, School Fuel partners will develop teacher and parent resources to supplement the branded campaign.  We believe the combination of distinctive, messageoriented packaging, together with teacher and parent outreach will create spontaneous learning opportunities for students and staff. </p>





","Since our inception in 2011, The LA Fund for Public Education worked with LAUSD to achieve several noteworthy accomplishments.  In addition to School Fuel, we have made three significant investments in LAUSD to date.





ARTS MATTER: is an unprecedented campaign to revitalize arts education in the nationâ€™s second largest school district. The campaign has been developed to drive public awareness for the critical role of arts education in public schools. By bringing together leading contemporary artists, including Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari, as well as Los Angeles entertainment, civic, and education leaders, Arts Matter is focused on rebuilding arts education in the creative capital of the world.  The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education was inspired to spearhead this initiative to address the creativity crisis existing in Los Angeles public schools. Today, only 2% of all instructional time is devoted to the arts in L.A. elementary schools. The purpose of Arts Matter is to develop a system that integrates arts instruction with traditional core subjects to dramatically increase creative thinking and learning for all students.  All proceeds raised throughout Arts Matter will directly support an innovative R&D fund to develop arts integration programs in L.A. public schools.  In addition to the successful awareness campaign, the fund raised over $850,000 to fund multiyear arts integration programs.





 ANTIBULLYING CAMPAIGN


Bullying is a pervasive problem in our schools with 71 percent of students report bullying as an ongoing problem.  Studies have linked bullying with anxiety, depression, and lower academic achievement.  We realized that in order to create a safe school environment where every student feels free to pursue their dreams without the fear of harassment or intimidation, students must take personal responsibility and show courage to stop bullying when they see it. When individual students stand up to bullying, they can ignite a cultural change schoolwide.  Together with LAUSD, the LA Fund brought together close to 7,000 students from 49 different schools to the Nokia Theatre for a screening of the documentary â€œBullyâ€ followed by a townhall discussion.  The largest gathering of youth against bullying in California, the students that attended were given the inspiration to be the change agents to combat bullying on their campuses.  The LA Fund will be providing antibullying grants to further support schools in their cultural transformation.





BLENDED LEARNING: We have established three different exemplar â€œblended learningâ€ programs that integrate online curriculum with traditional teacherled classroom instruction.  Our programs are pilots to create new instructional models to support LAUSD in its bold initiative to cross the digital divide for every student through the use of tablet computers. Each program leverages technology as part of a rotation model where students circulate between classroom instruction, online learn





","This team of partners meets together quarterly to provide input and support for this collaborative project:





Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD); California Endowment; California Food Policy Advocates; ChildObesity 180; Creative Artists Agency Foundation; Healthy School Food Coalition;No Kid Hungry LA / Share our Strength; InnerCity Struggle;Roll Global


SEIU Local 99","<0>Initially, School Fuel will be considered successful if the breakfast participation rate at the implementing schools increases from 29% (actual districtwide rate in 20112012)  to over 70% in three years. </p>





<p>A national partner housed at Tufts University, ChildObesity180 (CO180), will have a dedicated researcher located at the LA Fund.  CO180 is focused on leading the research component of the program, looking at student health, behavior, academic achievement and other indicators of success. CO180 will be responsible for designing and implementing the multiyear project that will evaluate School Fuelâ€™s effectiveness. </p>





<p>School Fuel has the potential to change nutrition and health for students of the LAUSD.  As such, all of the partners of School Fuel will be accountable to a clear set of outcome and research measures to guide the program towards success.  We have budgeted $50,000 per year to manage a largescale research and evaluation project at the scale of LAUSD.  While we expect nonprofit and academic partners to provide much of the services pro bono, this funding will cover project management and outofpocket expenses. </p>


","<p>In a recent study, obesity has cost Los Angeles County over $10 billion yearly in increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity.  If the obesity epidemic continues, the impacts on our economy and health care system due to chronic diseases are dire.  For children, being unhealthy will hinder them from obtaining a quality education, and eventually gainful employment and full participation in society.</p>





<p>Addressing the obesity crisis directly in Los Angeles with our comprehensive School Fuel Program that will impact the nearly 650,000 LAUSD studentsâ€™ health indicators such as obesity within the first 3 years of the program.  If successful, the program is projected to reach 2.5 million students by 2050 based on current enrollment numbers. </p>  


 


<p>In addition, research shows that schools with high breakfast participation yield tremendous student results. Numerous independent studies show that serving students breakfast significantly improves their cognitive and mental abilities leading to increased reading and math scores.  Other studies have linked breakfast to improved attendance, fewer disciplinary office referrals, fewer visits to the school nurse, and reductions in late arrivals to school, and most significantly a reduction in the likelihood of obesity and type 2 Diabetes. </p>","In the year 2050, through School Fuel all Los Angeles Unified School students will start their day with a nutritious and healthy meal.  In part due to School Fuelâ€™s educational messaging, students will be informed on how to make decisions regarding healthy habits and healthy eating.  As a result, the percentage of students that are overweight will become a small minority and their risk of future health problems such as type 2 Diabetes and obesity will be significantly reduced.  A healthier city will not only reduce the health care costs of Los Angeles, but also increase its productivity. "
3102248,2013248,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/LAMCII.html,Make Los Angeles the Innovation Capital of the World, Income & Employment,"LAMCII is focused on six specific areas of concern and interest. They are: Education, Policy, Capital, Comparative, Narrative, and Network.


	


We are developing concrete projects aimed at making a real impact on not just the technology and innovation sectors of Los Angeles, but on how the citizens of Los Angeles interact with the city, businesses and each other.  All projects are geared towards attracting, and retaining: diverse talent, entrepreneurs, businesses and capital to Los Angeles.





In the last year we have begun:





The Texpo Innovation Hubs


LAMCII is working in a public/private partnership with the City of Los Angeles, local universities, and recognized environmentally conscious developers to transform cityowned properties along the Expo line transit corridor into â€˜innovation hubsâ€™. Innovation happens with diversity: different businesses and organizations bumping up against one another on a daily basis will bring about new and interesting ideas, projects and solutions.





These hubs will provide worldclass physical space for startups and new economy businesses as well as community space that serves the dual purpose of providing a resource to local groups, organizations, and citizens and exposing our friends and neighbors to the opportunities inherent within the tech sector.





Phase one is underway at the Jefferson Transfer Yard, a 220,000 square foot 


facility slated to become the first Texpo Innovation Hub. LAMCII has identified four other sites along the Expo line that are earmarked for development in phase two of the project. Following the line to USC and Downtown LA, this will quickly enhance the flowthrough of information and innovation.





There will be bike rentals available at all of the Texpo Innovation Hubs, a small but powerful catalyst for green commuting, better relationships with the community, and better health for employees and residents.





EdgeLA Fellowship Program


We interviewed LAMCII members, many of whom own businesses in Los Angeles, and asked how many open positions are available at their companies. In August of 2012, from 25 members surveyed, there were over 550 open positions at local companies. Los Angeles County produces more graduates and has more residents holding PhDs than any other in America, but from our survey of Los Angeles universities, we know that at least 50% of engineering graduates leave Los Angeles. There is a huge opportunity for a stronger relationship between the nearly 1.1 million college students and businesses in the greater LA area, fulfilling the talent needs of LAâ€™s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. 





LAMCII seeks to bridge this gap by working with businesses, universities and city colleges to create the EdgeLA Fellowship program. The program will be a onestopshop to connect businesses looking for bright, welleducated talent with students looking for longevity and meaningful experiences. We are working with Internships.com, a local business, to build a platform that makes it easy for students and businesses to connect with and navigate the myriad of opportunities available in LAâ€™s innovation and tech communities.





Launching in 2013, the EdgeLA Fellowship Program creates an unprecedented citywide conduit for students and businesses and paves the way for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.





The EdgeLA Awards


The EdgeLA Award is not a recognition of achievement. It is an award to help an idea or product that needs significant support to get to market.





It is an â€œXPrizeâ€ styled venture meant to attract worldchanging ideas, innovation and creativity from all over the world to Los Angeles by offering a significant financial award, mentorship, and legal and marketing support from LAMCIIâ€™s partners. We will administer the contest in conjunction with Skild, an LA based company that creates platforms and provides services for competitions. 





The award will be presented at LAâ€™s Leading Edge Awards, an annual showcase of the worldâ€™s most innovative ideas after 3 rounds. Entrants are accepted online from anywhere around the world. In round one, the top 20 ideas are selected through crowd voting and executive panel. Round 2 will consist of a 2 minute video pitch that will be featured on the EdgeLA website and again, voted on by the public for originality, realization and credibility. The top 5 teams will move on to the finals. There will be one winner, but all finalists will receive prizes and support from LAMCII.





The goal of the Leading Edge Awards is to incentivize and attract brilliant entrepreneurs and fledgling companies to Los Angeles, offering them a home and network from which to launch their success.


 ","LAMCII has been able to attract some of the countryâ€™s brightest minds and biggest companies to lead the council and is continuously approached by business leaders and tech pioneers in the city looking for ways to become involved. Members of the council have given their time and resources freely and willingly to ensure the success of LAMCII. To date, we have expended 2,000+ hours of research, extracted 4,000+ pages of reports and engaged over 75 people and organizations not previously involved in the council. Council members, who already have significant commitments and responsibilities, have spent 300+ hours in committee meetings in 2012 and many more hours working independently towards Council goals.





LAMCII has developed two engaging and robust websites â€“ lamcii.org and edge.la. Both sites are quickly becoming hubs for information directed to those who want to understand how the future of LA is being navigated. The purpose of our websites is to be the gateway or aggregator of information about Los Angeles  involving the innovation and tech community, events and activities, real estate opportunities and contact lists. These sites act as an uberconnector for anyone wanting to become involved in this community. They help others realize the potential of the city and its members. 





As described above, the following initiatives are scoped and underway for 2013:





Texpo Innovation Hubs


EdgeLA Fellowship Program


The EdgeLA Awards





Beyond those three major initiatives, the Council has identified the following action items for scoping and next steps in 2013:


Better publicize LAbased capital sources


Attract Tier1 capital sources to Los Angeles


Support existing LAbased venture capital


Cultivate and expand the angel community


Improve access to city/county information


Encourage mayor to more closely align and promote LAâ€™s innovation economy


Build an entrepreneurial ambassador program with City Hall





Upon completion of the first year of the council LAMCII produced The Leading Edge Report â€“ a 44 page report outlining the councilâ€™s motives, initiatives and vision. 


The report is available here: http://lamcii.org/resources.html





LAMCII has captured the interest of both the leaders within the city and the media who have followed the journey and endorsed the vision. Key publications and media outlets include: NBC, Los Angeles Times,LA Business Journal,Yahoo!,Wall Street Journal

When we started LAMCII one year ago, we took a â€˜snapshotâ€™ of key areas that we consider important to the success of this project. As part of our mission, we will annually gauge our success by measuring growth in the following metrics in Los Angeles: 


Number and types of sources of capital available to startups 


Total amount of capital available 


Number of new startups 


Number of headquartered businesses 


Retention of talent from local universities 





Another key metric is moving the perception of people outside of Los Angeles ever closer to reality. We will continue to measure these perceptions through independent and commissioned surveys as well as reports from independent sources and management consulting firms. The objective is ensure that the perception becomes the same as the truth.





Perception: We are 35th out of 35 for Public Transportation.

This inspiration trickles down to high schools and improves graduation rates. Students graduating from our universities choose to stay in Los Angeles and begin careers with local businesses or are able to capitalize on their energy and brilliance and start their own businesses. 


Policy: Los Angeles has a business environment that is simple and rewarding to navigate, with a unified set of regulations that attracts entrepreneurs, investors, and small and large businesses alike. Our city is connected by a robust public transportation system through which people can access work, education centers, commercial centers, and leisure activities. More business and more jobs create a broader tax base which the city uses to build and improve infrastructure, creating a virtuous circle that benefits all communities.


Capital: The flow of investment capital into Los Angeles is no less than 50% of all investment capital coming into the State of California.


Comparative and Narrative: In all key measures, in both perception and reality, Los Angeles is among the top three cities in the world to live, work, and innovate. Every business must consider starting or headquartering their operations here. The misperceptions about Los Angelesâ€™s crime, pollution, congestion, lack of talent and business unfriendliness have not only been addressed, but are no longer associated with the city. 


Network: Los Angeles is the city where an entrepreneur or innovator can expect to be easily connected to sources of capital, top and most diverse talent, and supportive governmental resources. Improved public transportation and infrastructure creates a physical network that connects people and communities to jobs, universities, and all the beautiful and brilliant aspects of LAâ€™s amazingly diverse geographies."
3102249,2013249,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/thelatrust.html,Student Health = Student Success. Improving student health and readiness to learn in LA , Health,"The LA Trust for Childrenâ€™s Health envisions a LA2050 where all students are learning in an environment that not only supports their academic achievement, but one that fosters lifelong health and wellness through a comprehensive web of emotional and physical health promotion services and supports. This system of care enables students to miss fewer days of school, succeed in their academic careers, graduate on time and pursue successful futures. 





  The LA Trust is the champion of a bold vision for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) developing a network of 14 School Wellness Centers that will improve student health and academic achievement. The Wellness Centers will each serve the students and families throughout its network of surrounding schools and community brining needed access to health care and prevention for at least 40,000 individuals at each center. The LA Trust is working tirelessly with its many partners to open 12 of the 14 centers by June 2013.





  In 2008 the school district and county Department of Public Health joined forces with The LA Trust, and other supporters to find solutions for our children and teens who were experiencing violence, obesity, poverty and sexually transmitted diseases. These harsh realities and poor health outcomes were impacting student achievement leading to higher dropout rates and school failure. This group of innovators recognized that success in school requires that students are healthy enough to learn, but far too many students have little or no access to the health care they need. 





  Schoolbased health clinics in the district have provided more than 200,000 health care visits annually to elementary, middle, and high school students. But, it is not enough.  The bold vision for Wellness Centers moves beyond the traditional health care visit. The Wellness Centers are a onestop shop, providing near universal access to care and information about healthy diet and exercise, diabetes prevention, mental health promotion, and oral health care. Care doesnâ€™t end at the door of the Wellness Center, but expands throughout the school network to promote wellness for all students. The Wellness Center is not a place a student goes, but an experience students and their families have of being connected with essential preventive health care, health education, support programs, and health insurance coverage that create a healthy life at school and at home.





  Wellness Networks engage students and offer opportunities for students to promote positive health behaviors for themselves, other students and their community, thereby increasing their leadership skills, selfempowerment, and interest in a future health career. Wellness Networks also facilitate access for students to training and placement to pursue a health career pathway.





  The LA Trust is leading the charge in moving this vision forward, bringing the numerous stakeholders, sponsors, and experts to the table through the Wellness Network Learning Collaborative. It is this collaborative planning approach that ensures the success of the process by bringing LAUSD, federally qualified health centers, Public Health Department, and other partners together to negotiate the operational and programmatic details. The Wellness Centers will bring together all student programs within the district including mental health, pupil services, medical services, health education and nursing to build linkages and coordination to create a studentcentered approach to prevention and wellness promotion. 





  An unprecedented investment by the school district of $34 million has helped build the infrastructure, the bricks and mortar, for the Wellness Network. Federal grant funds have also been awarded to support the effort. But, the school district cannot do this alone. To realize the promise of the Wellness Network in Los Angeles, there has to be buyin and investment of public and private partners throughout the county. The LA Trust has brought in some initial foundations to invest in the vision. However, additional support is needed to: (1) Engage communities, students and families in the collaborative planning process, (2) Get creative and expand the horizon of services and supports that the Wellness Centers offer, and (3) Build awareness among students and communities of the Wellness Centers and the services available.   





   A grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation would support our efforts to develop and launch this innovative network of Wellness Centers that would redesign health care and prevention for a generation of youth and their families in Los Angeles.


","One of the most significant achievements to date for The LA Trust has been the engagement of a broad crosssection of stakeholders to develop a strategic plan, which outlines the vision for the Wellness Networks. This considerable undertaking has built the foundation and buyin across the many collaborators and partners.





The LA Trust has supported the opening of four new Wellness Centers on high school campuses within the school district. An additional eight Wellness Centers are currently under development and will be open by June 2013.


 


Additional achievements to date include:


	Convened more than 15 conferences, meetings and symposia with key stakeholders to build community buyin and support of the Wellness Centers


	Developed overall goals for Wellness Network operations, student and community engagement practices that have consensus among the schools and providers at 14 sites


	Provided resources and support so that more than 30,000 students could receive needed immunizations


	Supported student advisory groups on 14 campuses to increase awareness of and support for important health and mental health issues 


	Established plans to roll out a District wide oral health initiative for students in K3rd grade


	Raised funds for and created a District Oral Health Nurse position


","The LA Trust plays a leadership role as the convener and strategic coordinator by facilitating the Wellness Network Learning Collaborative. This collaborative brings partners and stakeholders together to build and realize the vision on the ground. However, this would not be possible without the commitment of LAUSD. In addition, all of the Wellness Networks are sponsored and managed by a federally qualified health center and supported by dedicated school personnel. The LA Trust also works closely with the California School Health Centers Association, the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County, the LA School Health Coalition, LA Health Action, the Childrenâ€™s Partnership, the LA County Education Foundation and many others.","The LA Trust and our partners in the Wellness Networks recognize that there is an important and necessary role for local community stakeholders, particularly students, families and caregivers when employing a placebased and populationbased approach. As part of the evaluation approach, Wellness Networks utilize students and community members in the data collection at the beginning planning stages and throughout implementation. Community members can map community assets, help set baseline measures for evaluation of key outcomes, and monitor progress on what matters most to students, families and communities.





Wellness Networks build in evaluation plans that are based on a set of outcomes common across school complexes that relate to the foundational principles of the Network. Evaluation goals include determining what works, whatâ€™s likely to be replicable and what holds promise for scaling up to other school complexes or the district as a whole. 





Wellness Networks conduct data gathering, analysis and evaluation of outcomes that help to demonstrate the efficacy of the Wellness Network concept, in comparison to traditional schoolbased health care. Consistent results and measures will demonstrate potential benefits to stakeholders in terms that students, families, providers and school staff will understand as tangible measures of their schoolsâ€™ and studentsâ€™ wellbeing. 





Quantitative and qualitative data (such as case studies) are both important to tell the story of student wellness. Such evaluation will also support efforts to seek funding and contribute to national knowledge about schoolbased strategies for improving studentsâ€™ wellness and readiness to learn.





Wellness Networks have written agreements with internal partners and providers and formal arrangements with external partners and providers. Agreements set out mutual expectations and benefits, including increased utilization of services, demonstrating success with underserved populations, demonstrating followup capacity and demonstrating outcomes to internal leadership and external funders. Agreements also cover quality assurance and improvement requirements.


","Every day more than 680,000 children attend school in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Many of our students have little or no access to essential preventive and primary health care. In some classrooms, one in three students are obese and are already on the path towards chronic health care conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. In some classrooms, one or two students will develop Type 2 diabetes before graduation and four teenage girls will contract a sexually transmitted infection. One in three young women in LA will have an unplanned pregnancy before their 20th birthday and many of them will drop out of school as a result.





We know, and the research confirms this, that kids that are healthy are better able to learn and achieve academic success. The Wellness Networks provide a launching pad for a range of public health interventions in the schools to address these serious issues and improve childrenâ€™s health and community health outcomes. Wellness Networks use a communitybased approach and strategies to address health concerns. Research has shown that schoolbased strategies are effective in improving health and student readiness to learn. Placebased approaches call for engaging the community where people live, work, learn and play to understand their resources, identify their needs and engage them in culturally appropriate ways.





Through the Wellness Networks and using evidencebased strategies, The LA Trust, in partnership with LAUSD and other key allies, is working to:


	Increase access to preventive and primary health care services


	Improve access to dental care for children by bringing in mobile dental clinics for preventive screenings, cleanings and treatment


	Engage communities in healthy living





Improved access to health information, health promotion interventions, and health care services will have a positive impact on the students and the overall health of the community. The longterm goals The LA Trust seeks to achieve improve student academic outcomes and population health over the next five to seven years, achieving outcomes such as:


	All students are career and college ready (in line with District goals)


	Decrease chlamydia and teen pregnancy rates


	Decrease overweight and obesity rates


	Increase insurance enrollment 


	Improved asthma management","Success in the year 2050 would see a generation of county residents that are healthier than their parents and grandparents because they were raised with universal access to prevention and wellness promotion supports and programs that set them on the path for lifelong health. In 2050 the disparities in chronic disease and poor health outcomes between the wealthy and the poor would be nearly erased with the equitable access to health care and coverage fostered by the LAUSD Wellness Networks.





LA County would be rated as one of the healthiest places to live in the U.S. based on its low rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, teen births and sexually transmitted disease. LAUSDâ€™s Wellness Networks would be a national model for promoting health in schools and the community and as a coordinated system that leverages numerous community resources and assets to support the needs of our community. 





In 2050 the deeply rooted connections between the schools, health care professionals, social services, students and their families create strong communities that are connected, thriving, and prosperous.

3102250,2013250,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/relationalcenter.html,Camp reLAte: A Community Organizing Approach to Cultivating Connectedness, Social Connectedness,"<p>In the last 60 years, Americans have experienced weakening social bonds and deteriorating communities, leading to profound isolation for people from every walk of life. During the same period, we have seen alarming increases in the kinds of human suffering that accompany social isolation. Low levels of educational and economic achievement, a high incidence of violence and crime, shorter life expectancies, and skyrocketing disease rates characterize cities where people are most disengaged from community.  In its vast sprawl, Los Angeles has lost a core sense of connectedness, leaving its residents too vulnerable to the alarming indicators correlated with isolation:  the erosion of social capital for those who most need it, the loss of social and interpersonal skills particularly among youth, the crumbling of a reliable ground for public dialogue on issues critical to our city, and the associated impact on our ability to make important decisions together. </p>


<p>We want a healthy, thriving, connected and diverse LA in 2050.  So, we MUST come together to change the social landscape.  And to do this successfully, we need to accomplish three essential goals: (1) stimulate our hunger to reconnect; (2) build our skills for healthy relating; and (3) create many new connectionsustaining structures. We need Camp reLAte!</p>


<p>In the tradition of Camp Obama and Camp Courage and adapted from the Public Narrative tradition, Camp reLAte relies on relational community organizing strategies to help Angelenos build capacity for more connection. Camp reLAte will recruit and train 50 Angelenos as â€œSocial Connectedness Leadersâ€ who will serve as catalysts for a social connectedness movement across our city. The campaign will assemble a diverse range of stakeholders representing the different communities, work forces and social movements that comprise Los Angeles. Over two intensive 2day workshops, this leadership group will learn a relational, momentumdriven community organizing strategy that spreads and maintains the values, skills and practices needed to usher in a new era of deep social engagement, increased volunteerism, active civic participation, and sustained relationship networks. </p>


<p>Camp reLAte targets four dimensions of social connectedness: emotional intelligence, inclusion of diversity, democratic process, and relational leadership.  Building skills in these areas will empower participants to lead their communities in building trust, identifying shared needs and values, and coordinating meaningful change.  Camp reLAte will teach leaders to construct a community story about a shared vision for a more connected LA in 2050, a story that unites and inspires our city. Upon completing the training, each Social Connectedness Leader will recruit 10 new participants to a daylong summit with a minimum of 500 in attendance. These stakeholders will be introduced to the relational movement model and learn how to build and sustain a culture of social connectedness by launching Community Action Networks (CAN's) throughout greater Los Angeles. A CAN is a versatile small group designed to incubate a culture of deep mutual support, interdependency, and leadership, to build a thriving social infrastructure that ignites civic engagement, democratic participation and social action. With the emergence of multiple CANs we will activate a viral process that leads to a living culture of connection and creates many localized and accessible structures Angelenos can join to practice connection continuously, develop leadership capacities and spread relational values.  </p>","<p>Funded by The Annenberg Foundation, The Relational Center launched a pilot antibullying campaign in select LAUSD campuses last year in partnership with LifeWorks, a Project of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center.  This campaign, called Get Empathy, focuses on spreading a culture of compassion in schools in our city, leveraging the same Community Action Network (CAN) model we are proposing for our LA2050 campaignâ€¦Camp reLAte.  </p>


<p>We were also recently awarded a grant from The JIB Fund to provide training and community capacity support to groups and organizations in LA working toward social justice and nonviolence for Angelenos who identify as transgender.</p>


<p>Since 2007, The Relational Center has reached over 3,000 residents of Greater Los Angeles with a broadbased social health strategy that includes mental health care, workforce development for service providers and community organizers, social action campaigns, public dialogue facilitation and capacity building support. </p>",We collaborate with several community organizations in Los Angeles on an ongoing basis to build momentum for social connectedness in targeted communities.  This project will benefit from those partnerships.,"Initial success will be evaluated by the number of attendees we are able to mobilize to Camp reLAte mass trainings, and the number of CANâ€™s (Community Action Networks) that are catalyzed from those events. We will measure the number of members and sustainability of groups. We will also integrate an evaluation system into our mass training that gathers feedback about participantâ€™s experience, relationships/ connections formed, plans for ongoing work, and usefulness of the target skills.","<p>For a sustainable Los Angeles in 2050, we know that we need greener buildings, a local food system, better education and a thriving economy. But we also know that these efforts require us to adapt our values and behaviors so that we can work together to maintain all those improved conditions and structures. Mostly change efforts succeed because people come together to create and maintain a shared vision because many different needs and interests shape their context. Even with initial success, sustaining longterm change is often difficult. Change is sustained by structure and culture.  We need a culture of connectedness to serve as the glue that holds all the pieces of our common vision together.  </p>





<p>Creating culture happens through relationshipsâ€”people engaging people in patterns of conversation, rituals and habits organized around shared values and stories.  To ensure social connectedness for LA in 2050, Camp reLAte will inspire Angelenos to cultivate new patterns that prioritize relationships across our many different factors of diversityâ€”economic status, neighborhood, faith, ethnicity, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc.  We will organize one another into a healthy culture of connectedness through communitycatalyzing leadership practices.</p>","<p>Success in Social Connectedness will mean that in 2050 Angelenos will know their neighbors. They will have a better understanding and appreciation for their shared interests. As a result, the city will see greater coordination in the sharing of resources. More cooperatives, time banks, and community gardens will emerge.  We will see more volunteerism, new civic associations, greater use of public space, more public events, less crime, safer communities, and greater mental health. Wellbeing will be the norm. </p>


<p>Los Angeles in 2050 will be a more inclusive city. Currently, diversity in Los Angeles is correlated with weak social connectedness. Relational organizing flips this equation â€“ with Social Connectedness Leaders organizing and training their communities to practice empathy and inclusion, diversity will find its way back to the top of the list of community assets, offering people a wide range of perspectives and contributions to problem solving around the complex issues that confront our city. </p>


<p>Volunteerism rates will rise with increased safety and stronger social networks that make us feel more engaged in our communities. Increased social capital and decreased isolation will encourage greater democratic participation and voting. With neighborhoods and communities organized by Social Connectedness Leaders, people will have a greater investment in the democratic process.  Success will look like a new public discourse about relational values that influence daytoday interactions and even political outcomes.</p>


<p>The LA2050 report warns that a poor education system leads to declines in social connectedness. But Angelenos are not only educated in schools. They learn from the social structures and organizations that shape their ideas and reinforce their behaviors. Even a strong education system may not successfully cultivate the empathy and inclusion we need for greater emotional intelligence.  More civic engagement means greater social health and more robust emotional capacities. </p>


<p>Finally, we believe that success in the Social Connectedness indicator will be measured by success in every indicator, because if Angelenos cannot sustain a culture of connection, they will not make use of the other conditions and structures associated with a successful Los Angeles. We consider social connectedness the dealbreaker indicator. Failure here has the potential to undermine the success of all the other indicators. </p>"

How about we build a 3D virtual LA using actual GIS data on all the natural & built environments here, add in social & economic data, make it relational & run it all through existing hydrologic & climate models thatâ€™ll let us move through time to 2050?</p><p> Ooh, ooh! What if we took that & made a game the public could use?! That would be some SERIOUS GAMING!!</p><p>Imagine what youâ€™d learn from that game. Youâ€™ve always had GREAT ideas about how we could do things better. What choices would you make to create a healthier, more resilient LA in the face of climate change? How can we integrate & prioritize the cycles of air, water, soil & fire in urban planning & design for a truly sustainable LA? Can we do that & be economically vibrant, too? Can we do it quickly enough so that our investments help us ADAPT rather than RECOVER?</p><p> What if you could play the game with that friend who also has ideas about how to run the city, butâ€¦.heâ€™s just wrong, yâ€™know? Play the game WITH that guy, & watch the impacts of his choices & yours as you play! What happens if we invest in public transit, add park space, revitalize existing neighborhoods, ramp up home solar, install cool roofs, capture stormwater, revitalize the river? What happens if we expand freeways, demolish crumbling neighborhoods to make way for new development, build more in the mountains, add concrete to the river walls, invest in desal? You can play until you find an approach that meets common goals. In fact, thatâ€™s a major objective OF the game: to prompt informed collaboration.</p><p> Imagine doing this with students in a classroom, or with your local Neighborhood Council? Making sound decisions about how we invest scant resources is challenging. The problems involved are complex & the various interests are often at odds. A solution seems logical to one partner, but makes the problem more complex for another. Playing the game, all parties see impacts of any approach & work toward common ground, learning that collaboration really does reap better solutions. Imagine being able to show the results of your choices to the public by projecting it on the side of a building downtown? Cool, huh?</p><p> LETâ€™S DO IT! â€˜Cause guess what? We need to make serious decisions NOW. And now we have the technology to make those decisions more quickly, in a more informed & equitable way â€“ collaborating on what LA 2050 will be. Letâ€™s start with 2013 & see what challenges the game presents: </p><p>20th c. LA relied on the idea that resources could be extracted from afar & that the city should promote car culture. This had huge ecological & social effects: air quality degraded, resource lands paved, groundwater depleted, agriculture extirpated, public health & quality of life in decline. Our freewaysâ€™ promise of mobility gave way to the reality of congestion & immobility - neighborhoods are physically & socially isolated, the single-family housing model turned people inward rather than toward community gathering spaces. In addition to ambient air pollution, freeway traffic directly affects the health of people living & working nearby. The flow of goods inland from the Ports exacerbates this effect & compromises the livability of communities near goods movement corridors. As LA grew, so did its dependence on imported water, with impacts to distant communities & regional competition for water resources. The energy needed to deliver & treat water, & to mimic compromised ecological functions, caused environmental impacts on a scale reaching well beyond metro LA.</p><p> Reestablishing ecosystem services is key to ameliorating impacts & rethinking urban form for the future. As the city reshapes itself with public transit & density, the time is ripe to require strategic, concurrent open space set-asides that provide critical ecosystem services.  Strategic densification, coupled with green streetscapes that enhance pedestrian, bicycling, & public transit opportunities, can provide local water supply, reduce air pollution, increase public health & significantly enhance our quality of life. But how do we accomplish this while supporting existing key services & keeping the economy strong?</p><p> Angelenos hold an illusion that the existing grid & infrastructure are permanent, yet our long-term success may depend on re-shaping that grid to integrate natural processes with sustainable urban design - to see ecosystem functions as critical infrastructure, while anticipating the need for resiliency & local resource security.  Serious Gaming provides a means to test both the reality & the value of that permanence in the face of a climate change & post-carbon world.</p>

","Everyone who uses the Serious Game will be given the means to provide online feedback to us in the form of a survey.  This will help us gauge increases in awareness and willingness to participate in contributing their ideas and voice in planning their future city.  The feedback will also help local agencies better understand the publicâ€™s priorities and concerns, and vice versa.   ","<p>We expect to see a broader awareness of the specific challenges Los Angeles will face in the era of climate change, a better grasp of what each individual can do here at home, a clearer understanding of how each choice affects another, increased collaboration and communication among stakeholders, education, empowerment, participation, vision, a shift in priorities, more local vocal engagement.</p> 





<p>We will be able to move more quickly in deploying the critical changes necessary to adapt to a shifting climate in a timely, cost-effective way while at the same time not merely protecting but improving the livability of the city and its environmental function and quality. </p> 


","<p>Our priorities have shifted. The region no longer relies on imported water supplies, nearly everyone has access to parks and transit, more local food, better air quality, large segments of our rivers, creeks and streams are alive. The Sacramento Bay Delta and the Colorado River Estuary have rebounded, relieved of the pressure of extraction from 9 million users in Greater Los Angeles. The air feels good to breathe in deeply when you walk and hike.  </p>





<p>We have rebuilt an ecologically functioning landscape with green infrastructure, an extensive public transportation network, pristine air, swimmable rivers and beaches, a vibrant economy, and a healthy populace equipped to be resilient in the face of whatever climate change brings.</p>

3102252,2013252,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Heal_This_City.html,Heal This City, Health,"<p>My idea, â€œHeal This Cityâ€ (HTC) will demonstrate how PURE, FRESH food, grown locally, is the medicine needed to heal our city's economy from the bottom up &, also, to heal its citizens from the inside out. As you'll read below, besides Health, HTC will also impact Education & the Environment.</p>


<p>LA2050's award will start 4 highproduction, circulatingwater farms, a virtual economyinaneighborhood, in Council District 1, 8, or 9 (TBD). These will be designed compliant with municipal zoning code that would, otherwise, outlaw traditional, petrochemical & poisondependent, soilbased farming.</p>


<p>In the selected neighborhood, HTC's farms will be located 10 to 15 minutes walking distance from every home in the service area. Typically, the heat of asphalt/concrete during summer keeps people indoors. HTC farms will cool the service area with greenery & give an incentive for neighborhood residents to stroll. Tranquil waterfall farms will be structured in climate controlled greenhouses, surrounded by green, parklike settings, producing plant nutrient with onsite fish aquariums. Farms will generate 6 to 10 times more produce per square foot, in (small & large) vacant lots, compared with traditional, industrial farms that work vast acres of land in distant, rural settings.


HTC farms will use 5% of water needed by soilbased farming, helping to conserve water in a critical period of drought. They release no pollution into the environment.</p>


<p>Local jobs will emerge, paying substantially more than minimum wage. These will be supported by ongoing sales of produce. Culinary programming will be coordinated, with friends & family dinners to be served. Priced at cost, they'll introduce neighbors to healthful & delicious nutrition designed (& proven) to increase healthful living, & even save lives (search â€œMay I Be Frank,â€ the movie, on Google search).</p>


<p>Grown in the place where people reside, HTC's fresh foods will be rich in living enzymes from the moment they are picked. They will be sold to consumers the same day. Grown without pesticides or herbicides, this food is more pure & better tasting than organic foods. It is not filled with preservatives & chemicals, as is the food that arrives by truck from hundreds of miles or (by airbus) from thousands of miles away. HTC will improve diets, enable better health for local families.


In HTCâ€™s target districts, longstanding poverty exploded in the aftermath of the great recession of 200809. Here, communities are tortured by the likelihood of potentially lifelong malnutrition. This problem is an outgrowth of urban blight that emerged during the troubled civil rights, 195060 era. Local children from that time are the diseaseprone adults of today, crowding emergency rooms & clinics with chronic heart & other organ ailments, diabetes, obesity, & mental illness.</p>


<p>In fact, these souls were crippled before the time when we discovered that a child undernourished in her first three years will not be able to effectively learn throughout a lifetime of standard education. So, in addition to chronic health problems, devoid of healthy learning tools, a whole generation of people have been effectively prevented from prospering. HTC will open doors to a new future, buttressed in its resolve by the dozens of studies that prove the value & healthful effects exposure to nature has on people living in hardscape urban settings. With exposure to nature in the context of food cultivation, the available rewards increase in terms of confidence, selfesteem & leadership; discipline & a sense of selfsufficiency also result. 


As HTCâ€™s economic model is proven viable, banks will step up to invest in its urbanfarming economy. Already, Chase Bank, Playa Vista, has expressed interest, knowing growth will occur where there was practically nothing in which to invest.</p>


<p>Beyond nutrition, as important as that is, the fundamental change that HTC will realize is transforming a generation of young people by exposing them to nature & the ancient discipline of food cultivation. 


In grammar, middle, & highschools, HTC's mission is to propagate farms throughout Los Angeles. By using school lands to establish gardenenhanced curriculum, students are empowered to learn better & to innovate in development of new, urban farming tools. implements are being designed & fabricated, shedding light on yet another economic engine of the new urban agriculture. 


Combining these assets with existing curriculum, students will learn the economics of â€œfarming the American cityâ€, establishing themselves as a growing army of urban farmers that can expand farms statewide, nationally and internationally.</p>


<p>Following graduation from highschool, students will help to propagate farms for retirement homes and impoverished neighborhoods. There are also hospital targets, such as Kaiser Permanente, that is seeking to enable the same goals HTC is focused on in underserved communities.</p>","Aquaponic/Aeroponic farm design and implementation/supervision at Hollygrove Farms, New Orleans, 201112

Success is measured by improved overall educational performance. Academic achievement is what they want to assure.</p>


<p>Our measure of results is how much enrichment & positive behavior modification we accomplish by involving students in food growing discipline. How much health is it possible for students to gain? We rely on interviews & scoring by students to measure our overall success in conjunction with teacher/administrator reviews.</p>


<p>In the projects we propose for farming in LA, we are selecting a neighborhood food desert, wherein all resident families will be interviewed before our first year's residency to determine the dietary deficiencies against current staples, given the absence of fresh foods in the community. During the first year's residency, we will revisit the least wellnourished 1/3 of families to sample progress & better understand how to make their experience at our farmers markets more beneficial. Giving families with children precedent, we will visit schools where our focus children attend to present & give those children pride, at the same time, raising interest in fresh foods among their peers & establishing the basis for outreach in those schools so we can eventually bring a school Aquaponics garden that grows food using fish nutrient as an entrylevel project. We anticipate maximum 3 schools (elementary, middle school, & high school) somewhere near the focus neighborhood. Further into the project, as the culinary program takes shape, we will gage the response to fresh foods recipes from at least two restaurant chef visits, & we'll invite families to contribute ethnographic recipes drawn from their family history.</p>


<p>Our bottom line, however, is the measure of farm success. We plan to sell our produce as it is grown... giving overgrowth to the homeless project with which we presently collaborate at Ocean Park Community Center or via friends of families in our own focus neighborhood. To the extent that we can increase consumption of fresh foods, locally, particularly by children, measuring that consumption by survey, we will be able to calibrate by extension what kind of effect we will have in the expansion phase following the first year.</p>


<p>An interesting model is developing at WESM that I will duplicate & modify for our neighborhood farm network. In the Health & Sports Medicine Magnet, the embedded culinary program has students calibrating themselves, measuring weight, height, body fat, blood levels, etc. Their diet, then modified, will include measured quantities of fresh foods grown in the Aqua/Aeroponic greenhouse  on campus. Each week, the physical exam will be given to each student anew, measuring various blood levels, weight, & body fat. I will get neighborhood participants to follow that regime as well</p>","<p>EDUCATION:


With the momentum we've experienced this past year as part of developing the program and curriculum for Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets High School, there's no question that teachers and principles recognize the value of Labtype greenhouse farming as opposed to traditional raisedbed farming. It's hard to overstate the value of this to highschool education. Teaching seed propagation, benefits of a varied crop mix to highschool students markedly improves test scores. (See studies uploaded, below)</p>





<p>ENVIRONMENT:


With increasing climate change, extended droughts are continuing, further limiting food production in the Central Valley and farming communities on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Bottom line, food prices are projected to spike sooner, not later. It is crucial to begin transitioning from wasteful and ecologically damaging farming practices that yield 46 harvests per year to intensive, highproduction circulatingwater farm methods that use 5% of water used in conventional agribusiness. Energy prices are also trending upward and this, too, affects cost and availability of foods. Without question, this project is tied to Los Angeles' economic viability as an agriculture industry state. With farm production shrinking in the Central Valley each year, Los Angeles could step into position as a highvolume producer of fresh foods and vegetables, improving the likelihood that agriculture will continue to be a strong element of the local and state economy.</p>





<p>The food desert issues and homeless problems in in Los Angeles are also at a critical juncture. There is no doubt that a vibrant urban agriculture economy will make a huge difference to Los Angeles' ability to maintain law and order, should production in distant rural settings undergo continued shrinkage as a result of changing climate, drought, rising energy prices and the need to scale back carbon emissions that trucking foods from farms to urban centers causes.</p> ","The harsh neighborhoods of L.A.'s inner city contain thousands of families held hostage to crime and gang warfare, even as their health is degrading as a result of fastfood addictions, rampant unemployment that keeps them poor, absence of fresh foods. The capitalist tool of choice, here, is the sale of illicit drugs. Combined with a prison industry that profits from incarceration, the absence of male supervision and fatherfigures in general is now the norm. Truly, the only possible way out of this mess is by means of an economy that TRICKLES UP, one grown with simple seeds that also leads to health. Food is the only entry level economy that works, central to everything worth living for, including family unity, culture and tradition, the celebration of life. No rational solution will emerge from entitlement programs that throw money or coupons at the problem without involving life transforming processes that cure people in ways they need curing. Where the bottom falls out of our society, the support for people falling through that hole must involve nutrition, jobs, and genuine food justice. Success in the year 2050 is an inner city environment remediated of toxic substances in homes (partnership we will enable through involvement of fellow builders volunteering to help us move that piece forward); hardscape neighborhoods softened by tree plantings giving shade, making neighborhoods strollable, lessening heat in summer, that lead walkers to park settings where farms dot the former hardscape. Success is more (if not all) children wellnourished, even if poor, children who appreciate where food comes from (not the supermarket), regularly partaking in the unifying grace that breaking bread with family and friends bestows on us when we sit together at a common table, who give thanks and enjoy the happiness of common gratitude. Success is the end of our oppressive ""war on drugs"" that punishes people for wanting to medicate themselves out of their misery, that locks them up, splintering families, delivering profits to faceless corporations that build and own human warehouses. Success is recognition for the civilizing effect that agriculture once bestowed on early human society, matched in the present and giving people tools of survival that they, themselves, activate at will. Success is money earned locally that circulates in the neighborhood to improve the quality of life, that grows as a community asset like the food growing where they live. Success is a city proud of the people in the hood, in the barrio, who are productive. Success is children learning, unburdened by hunger and lack of sleep. Success is fathers reuniting with their families, looking forward with hope. Success is the eradication of adulttype diabetes in children, the eradication of child heart disease brought on by obesity. Success is love between neighbors, who take pride from mutual selfsufficiency and a means of survival that they share."
3102253,2013253,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/thrdPlace.html,At thrdPlace our idea for LA2050 is to provide the digital infrastructure for community development, Social Connectedness,"<p>At thrdPlace, our idea for LA2050 is to provide the digital infrastructure for community development: to connect stakeholders around shared interests and improve identity in all of our communities. More than anything, thrdPlace is the story of you and me. ThrdPlace represents your family and friends and neighbors. We all want the ability to affect change where we have need.</p>


 


<p>At thrdPlace, we see a new way for us all to develop our shared communities. Each of us can create a movement to develop local community solutions were individually we only saw problems.</p>


 


<p>ThrdPlace is managed by a group of Angelenos, made of Urban Planners, Cause Marketers and Software Developers. Day after day, we see community needs that go unaddressed, community members who want to help but are unable, and resources that can impact these needs left uncaptured. Despite our expertise, too often we are frustrated by a lack of innovation in community development. The LA2050 Challenge is evidence that we are not alone.</p>


 


<p>ThrdPlace uses social technology to connect diverse community stakeholders around shared interests. For Profits, Non Profits and Community Members use thrdPlace to work together to resource and execute projects based on these shared needs. Thrdplace is the infrastructure that elevates that local need through story; organizes the funds, supplies and volunteers within a community needed to execute a solution; and connects stakeholders that share an interest in supporting. </p>


 


<p>The data generated on ThrdPlace, by its users (both organizations and individuals), is made available back to those users. Open data enables everyone to benefit from the collective activity of Angelenos and ultimately create a city that better reflects our needs as citizens. These data provide new insights to evaluate community need and activity against a variety of macro indicators from voting, to graduation rates and public safety. The improvement of local communities can and should be the throughline that connects all stakeholders within Los Angeles.</p>


 


<p>Specifically, ThrdPlace impacts the three Social Connectedness indicators. </p>


 


<p>Volunteerism: thrdPlace is a volunteer creation engine designed to engage the 9.8 million citizens of Los Angeles.  thrdPlace brings volunteer opportunities directly to citizens through a variety of digital channels. We create high rates of engagement by delivering stories of local need, peer involvement and a direct call to action. ThrdPlace enables all community stakeholders and their existing programming, to tap into the uncaptured energy and resources available within our local communities. Because our mission at thrdPlace is so closely aligned with LA2050â€™s goals, we envision an opportunity for LA 2050â€™s project submissions to use thrdPlace as a centralized platform to expand their capacity and achieve their goals.</p>


 


<p>Civic and Social Engagement:  


Building physical community is the best way to develop interpersonal relationships.  ThrdPlace brings shared interest in local issues to the forefront of citizen attention. It provides the opportunity for collaboration and exploration across stakeholders both on and offline.</p>


 


<p>Voting: Locally engaged citizens vote. Participating in a local project creates a sense of ownership and identity within community. The act of building relationships, taking ownership, and sharing ideas for local solutions leads to a population more likely to vote.</p>


 


<p>ThrdPlace has already successfully facilitated collaboration across sectors. Brands in both the public and private sector see thrdPlace as a market to interface and deepen relationships with local communities (and their consumers). Envision Charlotte, for example, is collaboration between the City of Charlotte, a local NonProfit and local commercial businesses (incl. Duke Energy, Verizon and Wells Fargo). Envision Charlotte is finalizing a partnership thrdPlace. They are activating local businesses and individuals to document, connect and resource projects within a regional sustainability action plan. Businesses are sharing their internal initiatives and supporting local projects started by citizens. Citizens are starting projects based on their local needs and driving support from their fellow citizens and local businesses. And communities are connecting through their shared goal.</p>


 


<p>ThrdPlace views Social Connectedness as the common denominator needed for LA2050 to achieve its goals across all of its indicators. ThrdPlace increases Angelenos civil and social engagement, voting rates and volunteerism.</p>


 


<p>Working together, we can share the collective vision of a successful Los Angeles and serve as a model for engagement and development for cities around the world. </p>


 


<p>(To learn more about thrdPlace please visit us here: http://thrdplace.com/blog/)</p>","<p>To date, the most important achievement of thrdPlace is our viability. 


In one year, thrdPlace has built a web platform for its service at www.thrdPlace.com.  Mobile will launch in April 2013.  ThrdPlace has developed the nascent business from a startup to a platform with a global footprint of impact.  And thrdPlace has achieve all of this with a limited investment...just $45K. </p><p>In January 2012, the two cofounders were accepted to startup accelerator StartEngine (www.StartEngine.com).  In March 2012, thrdPlace sold its first, pilot services to Whole Foods Market.  Whole Foods used thrdPlace to manage an international, workforce volunteer campaign across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.  To execute that campaign, Whole Foods identified, vetted and collaborated with over 200 Non Profits all on thrdPlace. </p><p>Since the pilot, thrdPlace has secured technology and distribution partnerships with ESRI and ADi Global.  ESRI (www.ESRI.com) is global leader in geodata mapping and visualization with $1B+ in annual revenue and 500K global clients.  ESRI signed thrdPlace to its Partner Program because their clients face challenges in community outreach.  ESRI is contracted to provide mapping and data analytics software to thrdPlace as well as distirbute thrdPlace to its existing clients.  Similarly, ADi Global (www.ADi.com) is contracted to distribute thrdPlace to its existing clients.  ADi is a global leader in supply chain and philanthropic efficiencies.  Their 300K clients around the globe face the same challenges in community outreach as ESRIâ€™s clients.  ADi, therefore, integrates thrdPlace into its salesforce and distribute thrdPlace on our behalf.</p><p>Furthermore, HUB Los Angeles (www.theHUBLA.com) invited thrdPlace and its cofounders to be founding members in its membership club.  HUB Los Angeles is dedicated to build the local, sustainable economy in Los Angeles and beyond.  ThrdPlace and HUB are working together to certify Certified B Corporations and Benefit Corporations, display their impact on surrounding communities and invite community members to optimize their impact in LA.</p><p>April 3, 2013 thrdPlace will demo its services alongside Mayor Antonio Villarigosa as he debuts his MYLA311 App.  The Mayorâ€™s mobile application will enable Angelenos to report issues in community development like potholes, illegal trash dumping and burst downed power lines directly to City officials for repair.  ThrdPlace is 1 of 7 technologies invited by HUB Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to promote emerging civic engagement tools Angelenos can use to develop their communities.</p><p>ThrdPlace has achieved a lot in a short period of time with little money.  Whatâ€™s more, industry leaders like StartEngine, ESRI, ADi Global, HUB Los Angeles and the LA Chamber of Commerce have all vetted thrdPlace.  And all of these industry leaders promote thrdPlace due to its potential to impact community development. </p>


","<p>ThrdPlace is the infrastructure that allows others to scale, connect and create change.  There are a number existing relationships, that will and already are leveraging thrdPlace within Los Angeles.  </p>





<p>For Profits â€“ Whole Foods, HUB Los Angeles, CornerStone OnDemand, California Pizza Kitchen, City National Bank, BiomimicryLA and TOMS Shoes, among others. 


Non Profits â€“ Social Justice Learning Institute, LA River Revitalization Corporation, CicLAvia, Habitat for Humanity, Los Angeles Regional Collaborative (LARC) and United Way, among others.</p>


 


<p>Public Offices & Utilities â€“ LA USD, Inglewood USD, Mayors Office, LA Chamber of Commerce, LA Food Policy Council, SoCal Edison. </p>


","<p>ThrdPlace will evaluate the success of its grant from LA2050 with its Impact Index.


The purpose of the Index is to rank Los Angeles and the interests of Angelenos based on key performance indices.  Currently, thrdPlace reports the success of projects.  Reports detail resources contributed, community partners, social media engagements and the demographics of their contributors.  The index will be integrated into the story of each project so that each user understands that they are contributing to a cause larger than him or herself.</p>  





<p>ThrdPlace will use the grant from LA2050 to improve its tracking and reporting capabilities.  To do this, thrdPlace aggregates indices for individual contributors and project creators as well as individual projects and campaigns (or, groups of similar projects).  Whatâ€™s more, the Index aggregates indices at the city, regional, state and national level.  The aggregated indices will be used to assign a letter grade to each project or city, for example, based on its performance.  The index will is sortable by indicator, region and time.  The index enables all community stakeholders to understand the gaps and clusters â€“ or, more specifically, how to move leadership and resources to areas of need within community development. </p>       





<p>Whole Kids Foundation, for example, is chartered to distribute grants to edible, school gardens in Los Angeles.   On thrdPlace the Foundation can discover schools that fit the Foundations criteria and are actively building gardens.


After finding schools in need of resources, the Foundation uses thrdPlace to donate funds.  Before they submit the donation they receive a notice: â€œDid you know â€¦ if you submit your contribution, you will immediately improve the ranking of urban gardens in Los Angeles from a C+ to a B and the access of Angelenos to fresh, organic food from a D to a C?  To donateâ€¦click â€˜Submit.â€™â€</p>





<p>Thereafter, the Foundation receives updates about the project throughout the lifecycle of the garden build.  Updates include social media and analytics that provide primary data and rich storytelling media that they can use to promote their outreach.  After the gardens are completed they receive detailed report of the impact they created.  Whatâ€™s more, the Foundation can now determine which projects or project participants to continue to support with donations through thrdPlace.    </p>





<p>Lastly, the Foundation compares the impact they created with outcomes they are chartered to develop for local communities.  The Foundation uses the map and analytic tools of thrdPlace to compare the output â€“ the edible school garden â€“ against outcomes â€“ voting or volunteerism, for example â€“ sourced from census data or market reports on thrdPlace.  Ultimately, the Index enables the Foundation to strategically target their community outreach to ensure they remain true to their charter and their communities document continued improvement. </p>


","ThrdPlace benefits Los Angeles by telling the story of its identity and connecting the diverse stakeholders that live within and contribute to it. 


 


Los Angeles is a metropolis that represents many, different communities.  Angelenos live in Hollywood because they identify with the people that live, work and play in Hollywood.  The same can be said about Venice Beach. 





Angelenos invest in the metropolis with their vote, taxes and consumption.  Our Governing bodies allocate of those limited funds by prioritizing the needs of the metropolis with the needs of the individual communities.  But, Angelenos also invest socially.  They invest in the longterm growth of communities as they build homes, patron local businesses, befriend neighbors and leisure in public parks. We need and want to be part of developing our communities.  thrdPlace is the platform that enables each and every Angeleno to tell his or her own story, mobilize the resources around them, and be part of developing their community.  





The story of Dâ€™Artagnan Scorza of Inglewood is not unlike many Angelenos.  Over the years, Dâ€™Artagnan has witnessed a lack of development in his community.  The City and businesses were not investing and longterm residents were moving away.  As he looked around Inglewood, he could see dozens of outdoor, blacktop basketball courts remain empty throughout the day and at night serve as a hub for criminal activity.  The courts that were built as a recreational space and a community asset now served as a liability.  Instead of giving over the identity of Inglewood to criminals, Dâ€™Artagnan decided not to move away but to invest in his community. 





To do this, Dâ€™Artagnan and his Non Profit, Social Justice Learning Institute, began to build urban gardens.  Dâ€™Artagnan rallied his community to build an urban garden on top of one of the courts.  As a result, the community now has a garden built by its community members, outfitted by For Profits and maintained by his Non Profit.  The garden provides local residents free access to fresh, organic food.  Because of Dâ€™Artagnanâ€™s investment in his community, he changed the identity of his local park. 


Social Justice Learning Institute is now using thrdPlace for their 100 Seeds of Change Campaign.  The goal of this initiative is to transform Inglewood into a healthy living community by empowering residents to grow their own food in a collaborative, local network.  The comprehensive, citywide plan enlists community members â€“ particularly, local youths â€“ to create 100 urban gardens located at Inglewood homes, schools and parks.   





Dâ€™Artagnan is an example of one Angeleno.  His actions can and are being replicated across our city.  With thrdPlace, all those micromovements can connect and together develop our city to be a true reflection of its citizens. 


","<p>Success for Social Connectedness is determined by the ability of every Angeleno to affect positive change in his or her own community. 


In 2050, Angelenos citizens have become a volunteer army for community development; and Social Connectedness is rated by LA2050 as green.  For Profits, Non Profits, and Community Members work together to address community needs across all LA2050 indicators. ThrdPlace develops Los Angeles as a (Digital) City as Platform to apply the activity (both on and offline) of every willing citizen in the development of our shared communities.  Los Angeles stakeholders use thrdPlace to monitor the pulse of Angelenos and the health of our shared city. </p>


<p>At thrdPlace we believe, like LA2050, that education is the silver bullet to improve social connectedness. Consider a future where every school has used thrdPlace to build a community garden.  During the week, students learn life sciences as they turn school grounds into gardens. On the weekend, community members join to learn how to maintain and harvest these gardens. The community gains access to produce through community supported agriculture (CSA) boxes from schools full of native plants from permaculture gardens to organic fruits, vegetables, and fish from highyield aquaponics gardens. Each harvest provides a new opportunity for community stakeholders to participate. 


Consider a young entrepreneur who contributes a proposed aquaponics garden on some underused land.  A local building supply store contributes irrigation supplies; a local activist group contributes garden training and oversight; and the community â€“ school children, parents, and teachers â€“ contribute funds, supplies and volunteer hours. 


Each harvest provides an opportunity for community stakeholders to forge new relationships with one another. They share ideas and find support to take on larger issues like decreasing rates of adolescent diabetes and increase graduation rates. They discover ways replicate success from one school to the next. In this way, projects like a community garden do more than grow food, they create the social fabric and cultural community more akin to a village than a sprawling metropolis. </p>


<p>Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest landowner in Los Angeles County. Similarly, other potential hubs of community life, including parks, canyons, beaches and office parks, can catalyze the transformation of community assets into hubs of community action. A great example of one potential thrdPlace client that represents the vast potential of thrdPlace and LA2050 is the Los Angeles Revitalization Corporation (http://www.lariver.org/). With over 300 points of intersection between the river and the surrounding community, letâ€™s see if we can do more together than we could ever do alone. We hope to see you on the riverâ€¦ </p>

3102254,2013254,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/tiachucha.html,Tia Chuchas Centro Culturals Arts Transforms Community  A Multimedia Wellness Project,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>Poor communities are usually portrayed as fonts of violence, stagnant thinking and deficit outcomes. But we at Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural see the poor as rich with talents, skills and imaginations. Every person, even without outside resources, is by nature regenerative. The concept behind artsbased healing workshops is to tap into and draw out this abundant capacity to establish healthy lives, families, and culture â€“ even in a faltering economy. A new currency of restoring and transforming from one's own gifts opens up a new imagination of how to relate by giving and getting, with healing practices and disciplines. This is about renewing community rooted in caring and sharing.</p>


<p>The objective is to get everyone to live out their passions, their innate story, the ""dream"" they were born with. These yearlong weekly workshops in 2013 will pull from this largely indigenous concept and set up the nexus where people are expressive in modern times. There is enough evidence and anecdotal illustrations of how the arts transform lives and communities.</p> 


<p>Presently we are held in the paralysis of a market driven scarcity society. Mortgages, the wage system, and money are manmade illusions that have blinded us to the true source of our liberation â€“ the abundance in nature, in our imaginations, and in the proper relationships between our natures and the nature around us. The goal is to reclaim the personal authority and autonomy for every person so they can properly intertwine with and grow from community on a basis of cooperation.</p> 


<p>The Northeast San Fernando Valley is made up of indigenous rooted people, primarily from Mexico and Central America, with significant numbers of African Americans, Asians, and European Americans. The majority are Christians/Catholics; Arts Transforms Community workshops are not meant to challenge or change anyone's belief systems. Through the arts and imaginative practices, everything gets renewed and reaffirmed. Still we go back to indigenous sources of knowledge because of their perennial quality across time, places and circumstances.</p> 


<p>Our complex industrial world has disconnected us from these and many people are lost as a result. Our basic premise is that the healthy wellbeing of each is dependent on the healthy wellbeing of all â€“ and the inverse: the healthy wellbeing of all is predicated on the healthy wellbeing of each. The goal of Tia Chucha's arts workshops â€“ including music, dance, theater, writing, puppetry, photography, painting, and more â€“ is to create a new basis for wellness with indicators and outcomes not clinical or bureaucratic.</p> 


<p>We aim to be the example that a whole community approach to addressing trauma and economic instability utilizes the arts to heal and revitalize. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural & Bookstore has seen such possibilities whenever people are given spaces to learn, to create, and to deliver. We use a process of turning original ideas to execution with research/study, mentorship and organization. The arts are not just a â€œnice thing to do,â€ but vital to the new economy and digital world we are all entering. We need a new imagination â€“ with new content and new forms â€“ to align to the possibilities in this world.</p>","The Northeast San Fernando Valley is a community of 500,000 â€“ the size of the City of Oakland  yet it had no bookstores, movie houses, art galleries, or full fledged cultural spaces until Tia Chucha's opened its doors twelve years ago. We now provide a bookstore, a deli/ artisan shop, arts workshops, an art gallery, film nights, weekly Open Mics, community dialogues, and author readings. In addition we host Young Warriors, a youth empowerment group, often working with troubled youth through mentors, rites of passage, and the arts as well as own poetry press, Tia Chucha Press, and the only outdoor annual literacy festival for the greater San Fernando Valley: â€œCelebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung.â€ We have a Mexica (socalled Aztec) danza resident group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, officially sanctioned to teach and perform this art form from preconquest Mexico and Central America. Also since Tia Chucha's creation we've seen the birth of independent groups like El Hormiguero (the Anthill), Bikesanos Bike Club, the San Fernando Arts Collective, Youth Speak Collective's Sports, Mural, Gardening and Digital Arts projects, and the establishment of a new high school with academies in Social Justice and Humanities, the Arts as well as Engineering and Technology called the Cesar Chavez Learning Academies. Our presence in a mostly rundown strip mall with many uninhabited spaces has brought new small businesses and even a major market chain. Tia Chucha's has proven that the arts stimulates economic activity while helping reduce violence, apathy, and low school participation. ","We presently facilitate arts workshops and the Young Warriors project with El Nido Family Resource Center in Pacoima, one of the poorest communities in Los Angeles County. We have partnered with Los Angeles Mission Community College in Sylmar to do our ""Celebrating Words"" festivals. We have done workshops and talks at the Barry Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, the largest juvenile lockup in North America. We have conducted talks and workshops in Sylmar and San Fernando high schools, Discovery Prep Charter, the Cesar Chavez Learning Academies, the Maclay and Olive Vista middle schools, among others. And we have had about 10 schools from the L.A. area a year do field trips to Tia Chucha's to see first hand what we do. We plan to extend these.","We presently serve 14,000 children, teens, adults, and seniors a year at Tia Chucha's. Our staff has surveys on paper and from head counts. We also do analysis of all our workshops for content, form, and outcomes. Already in twelve years, we have seen higher school participation and the rise of imaginative ways to do the arts and projects like gardening, mural projects, activist collectives, and more. Our facilitators and instructors work with us to evaluate the growth of each participant in the arts and in the community. We also hold monthly Community Council Meetings open to the staff, facilitators/instructors, volunteers, and board members to evaluate and propose what we do at Tia Chucha's and how we can do better.","Los Angeles is called ""the Entertainment Capital of the World."" It has a creative economy that generates close to $4 billion in state tax revenues, employs a million people in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and accounts for $100 billion in sales/receipts in L.A. County alone. Yet there are whole areas, whole neighborhoods, often for miles on end, where there are no bookstores, no movie houses, no art galleries, no cultural spaces. These culturally barren sections include South Central L.A., East L.A., the Harbor, and the Northeast San Fernando Valley. The arts are concentrated in downtown, the shoreline, Hollywood, museum row, and such. We are not opposed to these vital touristladen centers of culture and commerce. But we need a neighborhood arts policy in Los Angeles so that every community can benefit from cultural store fronts, independent bookstores, public art projects including murals, workshops in all the arts, digital arts, and more. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural's ""Art Transforms Community"" workshops prove this works in any neglected and resourcelimited area of the city. Flavored by the people of the Northeast San Fernando Valley, Tia Chucha's is a model of how every community can have its own cultural wellness center  they can name it for someone else's aunt if they wish. The point is that the arts are they key ""log,"" the one stake that when moved opens up a logjam. The arts reach across ethnicity, race, religion, and culture. The arts are the unityindiversity that finds commonality and wholeness to one of the most divided and contentious cities in America.  ","Everyone is laden with creativity, ideas and an abundance of talent. Liberating this will make 2050 a more peaceful, cooperative and thriving time. The future is moving toward integrality: How to integrate mind, body and soul in people, but also aligning the economy, politics, and culture to the regenerative power in such people and the regenerative capacity in nature. We will move away from the brokenness, alienation and fracturing that is prevalent in our time. The main direction is thisto become a complete human being means becoming a complete artist. Oppressive and exploitative conditions, which are rife in today's post industrial realities, are already being pushed away by the technological advancements and the intellectual/creative developments in our society. 2050 should see all this taken to its conclusiona world where the common love of beauty and truth brings science and art into a unified whole. A time when people's passions becomes their professions, and working for others means working for oneself. This does not mean homogenizing everyone, but a true individuation that at the same time leads to the common development, rise and enrichment of all. If there were cultural spaces like Tia Chucha's everywhere, we can begin to see the building blocks of such a future, such possibilities, such an integral time and place.  "
3102255,2013255,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TRUSTSouthLA2050.html,TRUST South LA 2050: Affordable Homes Sustainable Neighborhoods, Housing,"TRUST South LA is building a model for sustainable living in LA in 2050, with a bold plan to make better use of the 3000 acres of underutilized land in South LA, which can be replicated throughout the City.  We are working to create affordable homes for our local families, placing land under community control, and building green, healthy neighborhoods. 





As a grassroots community organization, TRUST South LA is committed to building a vibrant South Los Angeles.  We believe that how we use land  and who controls that land  has deep implications for the future of our City, our nation, and our planet.  TRUST South LA was born from our communityâ€™s long struggle against displacement of workingclass families, as property values and rents have risen in the neighborhoods south of Downtown LA, near the University of Southern California (USC) and around the new Expo Line.  We value community ownership, responsible development, transparency, and the development of grassroots leadership.  





Over 40% of South LA households earn under $25,000 per year.  In fact, 80% of our residents earn below the Cityâ€™s median income.  Clearly, we need economic development to increase peopleâ€™s income levels, but we also need creative strategies to increase the amount of affordable housing available to these families.  The majority of households in South LA can afford between $450 and $750/month for housing costs.  Rents in our neighborhoods currently range from $900/month for 1 bedroom units, to over $1,600/month for a 3 or 4bedroom home.  There is an enormous gap between what our families have to spend on housing, and the actual cost of that housing.  The result of South LAâ€™s severe affordable housing shortage is that many families are being driven out of our neighborhoods, or they are forced to doubleup in existing homes, causing conditions of crowding that are emotionally stressful for adults and children alike. This situation has been exacerbated since the economic crisis has driven up foreclosure rates, and many of those properties are subsequently acquired by real estate speculators.





Here is TRUST South LAâ€™s plan to protect our community from the threats of rising housing costs, deteriorating housing conditions, increased housing speculation, and displacement:





1) Purchase foreclosed homes that are on 5,000+ square foot lots, in the same neighborhood, and place the land into TRUST South LAâ€™s community land trust.





2) Add a second 2 or 3bedroom, 1200 square foot home on to each lot, utilizing highquality, welldesigned manufactured housing â€“ taking advantage of existing State laws and local regulations to build these â€˜backyard homesâ€™, and cutting land costs in half.  





3) Transfer the homes into a limited equity housing cooperative, through which the tenants collectively own their homes, while the land continues to be held under the stewardship of our community land trust.





4) Make the entire neighborhood more livable by working with the residents, their neighbors and other partners to advance street improvements for bikes and pedestrians, and to add more green and open space.





Funding from LA2050 will support a demonstration project for residentcontrolled housing in South Los Angeles that will be affordable to lowincome households.  The award will enable TRUST South LA to purchase and to rehabilitate six existing single family homes, and to add a newly constructed units on the same parcel, yielding permanently affordable homes for 12 families â€“ housing 6072 people by the end of the one year pilot phase.  However, most importantly, our goal is to create a model that can be replicated throughout South Los Angeles and other parts of the City, with a demonstration that will draw the attention and confidence of City and State policy makers and funders. ","TRUST South LA works to establish community control over economic resources. We acquire land to be held collectively, and in perpetuity, by lowincome community residents. Thus the land will never be subject to speculative real estate activities, industrial practices that compromise health, or slum housing practices. Use of the land will instead be directed by â€“ and forever controlled by â€“ lowincome community residents, to meet the needs of their families and neighbors. 





Important achievements include:


Maintained a formal, voting Membership of grassroots community residents to hold ultimate authority over organizational assets and decisions, and to elect a grassroots Board of Directors.





With partners, raised $5 million in equity from private and public sources for land acquisition.





With the City of LA, secured: $1 million for pedestrian improvements, in a hightraffic near an elementary school; and $5 million for development of a 4 acre park in LAâ€™s most parkpoor Council District.


 


Led the Housing Working Group of United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD) Coalition Housing Working Group during the Lorenzo community benefits agreement and USC Specific Plan campaigns, which resulted in over $20 million in funding for affordable housing, 4000 new beds of student housing, and a tenantsâ€™ rights legal clinic at USC.





With the City and nonprofit developer Abode Communities, advanced plans to develop the 7 acre Slauson&Wall Brownfields site with a 4 acre park, community center, and 120 affordable homes â€“ all designed by the community.





Established a vibrant Slauson&Wall Neighborâ€™s Organizing Committee to move forward all planning, community engagement and campaign work related to this transformative project.





Used Theatre of the Oppressed as a community education and advocacy tool, including utilizing street theatre to explain dynamics of gentrification around light rail.





Organized a tenantled campaign that resulted in the ownersâ€™ agreement to sell the 48 unit, 2 acre Rolland Curtis Gardens property adjacent to USC and the Expo line, rather than displacing families to convert to student housing; and conducted a participatory planning process to rebuild as a key Transit Oriented Development with affordable housing for 140 families, bike and care share programs, and communityserving commercial uses.





Brought CicLAvia to South LA, opening up the streets for thousands of people to use as recreation space, for walking, biking, running, skating, and simply hanging out â€“ as a step in TRUST South LAâ€™s growing mobility work which seeks to better utilize public land to serve local families.





Initiated Ride South LA mapping projects as community advocacy tools, to demand equitable bike/pedestrian infrastructure investment in South LA.


","Real Estate Development Partner â€“ East LA Community Corporation:   ELACC has developed 360 affordable housing units in East LA, organizes community residents to advocate for change, and provides homeownership counseling.  TRUST South LA has initiated negotiation of an MOU with ELACC, anticipating that we will share a project manager who will be responsible for acquiring sites, and managing rehabilitation and new construction.





Manufactured Home Supplier â€“ Next Step:  The Next Step is the first and only national strategy to bring high quality, Energy Star factorybuilt homes to nonprofits nationwide.  By aggregating demand for the factory built housing industry, they are able to pass on a bulk discount to TRUST South LA. 


","Success will mean: 


We have proven the efficacy of the development prototype (two units per lot, blending rehabilitation, and new construction);





We have successfully advocated for (a) policy reform that creates greater certainty around the land use and entitlement processes for â€œbackyard homesâ€ and (b)  new public and private capital sources to leverage for future phases of development;





We have tested the market to demonstrate that there is a demand for residentcontrolled housing;





We have begun to redefine the policy framework around single family foreclosures to establish a systematic approach to stabilizing neighborhoods, that is both subsidyefficient and affordable in the longterm. 





We expect to achieve these specific outcomes:





(1) 12 homes which are affordable to South LA families;





(2) LA Department of City Planning, LA Housing Department and California State Office of Real Estate policies support implementation and replication of the model





(3) Train current and potential residents to assume control over their housing (including what is cooperative housing, how to oversee a management company, analyzing an operating budget)





(4) Partnerships are in place to improve and green the area surrounding the homes





 Finally, we will measure the success of this project â€“ as we do all of our organizationâ€™s efforts â€“ through a participatory evaluation process which analyzes how well the project aligns with TRUST South LAâ€™s Principles of (1) developing community consciousness, (2) developing a new generations of leaders, (3) securing community ownership, (4) caring for the earth, (5) sharing knowledge and skills, (6) being experimental, (7) maintaining transparency, (8) being inclusiveness, and (9) making decisions collectively.


","Los Angeles defines urban sprawl, with hundreds of miles of roads and freeways that have shaped the City over the past five decades.  We all recognize that it is time to rethink, replan, and rebuild Los Angeles to be more compact and less dependent on cars.  However, one of the challenges to this vision of smart growth is the many thousands of acres of singlefamily neighborhoods scattered throughout the City, which do not have lots that can accommodate multifamily housing.  TRUST South LA is developing an affordable housing prototype for more families to comfortably live in these types of lowdensity residential neighborhoods â€“ starting in our own South LA backyards.  Furthermore, our model for single family affordable housing will require minimal government subsidy, which is critical in a time of reduced resources, creating the potential for large scale replication even during these lean times.  With funding from LA2050, this demonstration project will provide an effective advocacy tool, as TRUST South LA and others pursue the capital subsidies from public and private sources necessary to implement this costeffective housing model.  





As a unique concept, TRUST South LAâ€™s model creates affordability by acquiring properties discounted through the foreclosure process, and then doubling density to decrease the land cost per unit â€“ essentially cutting our land cost in half for each home.  Utilizing a mix of rehabilitation and manufactured homes, we can deliver the finished units for $175,000 per home â€“ which is approximately HALF the cost of new multifamily construction. TRUST South LA will create permanent affordable housing â€“ on land held in perpetuity by the community through our land trust â€“ for 50% of what it currently costs to construct permanently affordable rental units!  With a successful demonstration project, we can transform our Cityâ€™s approach to creating affordable housing in lowdensity neighborhoods.





Additionally, our longterm goal is to create scatteredsite limited equity housing cooperatives held on our community land trust, providing residentcontrol and residentownership with longterm affordability.  Unlike affordable forsale developments that lose their affordability after a subsidized homeowner sells, community land trusts circumvent the loss of that initial subsidy through community ownership of the land, which passes the benefits onto future generations. Initially, until the limited equity coop model becomes feasible through increased subsidy sources and by taking the model to scale, we will provide rental housing under the ownership of our membercontrolled nonprofit.  





Finally, as we keep families in their neighborhoods  and create good bike, pedestrian and public transportation infrastructure in those neighborhoods  we get more Angelinos out of their cars and into the streets.  This means less greenhouse gas emissions, lower obesity rates, safer streets, and more connected communities throughout LA.","By 2050, we want the lowincome residents of South Los Angeles neighborhoods to have shaped the development of housing, recreation and open space in their own neighborhoods, promoting economic vitality and healthy environments.   TRUST South LAâ€™s strategy of collective ownership is the result of our communityâ€™s desire to control the decisions that will dictate the future of our neighborhoods.  With community ownership of real estate assets, we can ensure longterm affordability of housing, and direct the use of that land in perpetuity.





By 2050, we want a Los Angeles that is built more densely in order to provide more housing opportunities to families at all income levels.  It is essential, as we add more housing, that we also create neighborhoods that are more livable.  Our collaborations with partners and local residents will create more green space; opportunities for local food production; and the public transportation, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure that encourages people to out of their cars and into their neighborhoods.

3102256,2013256,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/housevets.html,Veteran Housing Retention Initiative, Housing,"Ending homelessness among veterans has been the goal of U.S. VETS since its inception. Housing is the key to achieving success in the most basic needs of life. Without stable housing it is nearly impossible to maintain employment, family relationships, health and connection to society. U.S. VETSLos Angeles has been on the forefront of serving homeless veterans in Los Angeles since 1993. The site opened a new permanent housing building in December 2011 increasing the number of affordable housing veteran beds available at the site to 660. Although the numbers have dropped significantly in the past 20 years, Los Angeles still remains the number one city for homeless veterans with between 6,3008,000 veterans living on the streetsâ€”more than any other American city. Veterans represent a disproportionally high percentage of the Los Angeles homeless population at 20%.





With the Obama administrationâ€™s announcement of its goal to end veteran homelessness by 2015 there has been a deliberate shift away from transitional programs that help homeless veterans address their issues and prepare them to reenter the workforce and regain their economic independence. The current model of HousingFirst favors putting homeless veterans into permanent housing and then providing mental health and addiction treatment. Not surprisingly, the prospect of permanent housing is very appealing to homeless veterans, especially if they are told that they can continue to use drugs and not risk losing their housing.





In support of the HousingFirst model, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) issued VA Supported Housing (VASH) vouchers for veteran to pay for the permanent housing. The VASH program quickly ran out of vouchers and the system was overwhelmed by more applicants than available funds. Even those who were approved ended up waiting for months for a VASH case worker to process their paperwork and approve the apartment. Once housed, most veterans had little to no follow up from the overworked VASH case workers. By the VA measurements, the program is a success because veterans are off the streets and in permanent housing. However, as a program that has the benefit of observing the transitioning veterans to our adjacent building, it has become quickly apparent to U.S. VETS  that many of these veterans are not equipped to maintain their housing and thus enter back into the cycle of crisis and homelessness. Housing retention is the missing piece from the VAâ€™s push to embrace the HousingFirst model. Although that model includes case management to assist veterans after the move into permanent housing, the reality is that the local VA has exhausted its allocation for staffing and funding to serve the high number of veterans in need and are encouraging veterans to seek assistance from other community agencies. 





Our proposed LA2050 program will provide the wraparound case management necessary to increase veteran housing retention rates. As operators of a transitional housing program that is actively working to meet a 65% transition rate to permanent housing, U.S. VETSLos Angeles will already have established relationships with veterans moving into community permanent housing. Additionally, the U.S. VETSLos Angeles outreach team connects with 18002000 veterans annually and makes referrals for housing and other services.





The Veteran Housing Retention program will employ a Housing Retention Specialist who will follow up with recently transitioned veterans via personal visits and phone calls to make sure that they are maintaining their homes, budgeting their money, paying their rent/utilities on time, managing their health/mental health issues with the VA medical center.





The income assistance provided by the VASH program was a successful motivation for homeless veterans to seek permanent housing. The U.S. VETS Housing Retention program will also offer a financial incentive in the form of tenant based assistance for security deposits, utilities and emergency supplies.


","10,000+ veterans served since we opened our doors in 1993.


Our Supportive Services for Veteran Families program became a national model within its first year of operation in 2012.


We consistently maintain an 80% positive transition rate from our transitional programs and a 75% sobriety rate. 


We are the largest veteran community in the U.S.A. with the capacity to house 660 veterans.


Opened a 196bed permanent housing in 2011 specifically to address the need for affordable housing for low and verylow income veterans","The Veteran Housing Retention program will work with the VA, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, Employment & Education Department, California State Parole, HealthRight360. Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, Department of Public Social Services, Department of Child Services and Cloudbreak Communities.","The program will be measured by the percentage of veterans who retain their housing for 18 months with a goal of at least 65% reaching that benchmark. 





Additionally the program will measure the percentage of veterans who maintain their sobriety if in recovery. For those who are not in recovery the program will measure how many seek treatment or if relapse occurs whether they agree to return to treatment rather than continue using. 





The program will reinforce the importance of steady income and therefore track the employment rate of participants. If veterans are unable to maintain their housing for economic reasons, the Housing Retention Specialist will work to transition them to a program or affordable housing rather than have them return to homelessness.





The program will be evaluated based on whether benchmarks for client success in the measurement areas of maintaining housing, sobriety and employment are met and modifications to the program design will be made based on the data.","Our Housing Retention Program will directly benefit 55 veterans and their families with helping them attain and maintain permanent housing. The program will provide up to $1,125 in tenant based rental/utility assistance. Additionally, these veterans will benefit from the continued clinical case management services and ability to address developing issues before they reach crisis mode. Los Angelesâ€™ high rate of homeless veterans will be decreased by the addition of this program, and the rate of housing retention will increase. Some of the populations most at risk that U.S. VETS assists is veterans with mental health issues and histories of incarceration. In both populations, access to community support services has been proven to decrease the incidence episodes of care in hospitals and recidivism among the parolee population. Reducing emergency hospital episodes and lock up time saves the city and State tremendous amounts of funding that can be directed at other citizens. 





As the veterans in the Housing Retention program succeed, they will be more engaged in their communities, with their families and their veteran peers. After 20 years of providing housing to veterans, U.S. VETS has seen the benefit to the community of veterans who become role models of positive behavior. They influence the behavior of their peers and their children in meaningful ways.





Once housing is stabilized, people are able to focus their attention on improving other areas of their lives including continuing education and participation in community and cultural experiences. Removing the stress of not having a sense of security in the basic human need of safe shelter will enable these veterans to improve their health and relationships with their families.",No More Homeless Vets  period!
3102257,2013257,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/HYPO-PARK.html,HYPOPARK, Health,"</p>hyâ€¢po [hahypoh]


noun


.to increase, boost, or augment<p>


</p>Our proposal consists of a design for a prototype for a highperformance, useintensive outdoor public recreation hub, for construction on a vacant urban property. The HYPOPARK, as we call it, is an actionable, placebased remedy to address the link between childhood obesity and the dearth of per capita park space, particularly in those neighborhoods of Los Angeles that are economically depressed. It is intended to serve as a demonstration project that illustrates and proves the viability of a new model of public recreation space: one that a) is easier to acquire and realize than a conventional park; b) is designed to attract and promote the kinds of aerobic activities most conducive to healthy lives; and c) that in doing so, will become a popular hub of activity that supports the (social) health of the community that will galvanize around it. Most importantly, HYPOPARK is designed to make exercise entertaining, challenging and a spectacle all at once. It is a safe, highdensity public jungle gym/playground, with apparatus to appeal to children of all agesâ€”from toddlers to seniors.<p>


</p>While it is reasonable to attribute the city of Los Angelesâ€™ inability to increase its current supply of park space to a general lack of public funds, we believe that the problem lies as much in the model of park design itself, whose decadesold convention assumes a very low â€œfloorarearatioâ€ (FAR) of one square foot of recreation space for each square foot of land purchased. As urban land rises in cost, the cost of acquisition has become an increasingly large share of the cost of producing a park, to the point of rendering it an unsustainable proposition, except in smaller affluent cities.<p>


</p>The HYPOPARK solves this conundrum by learning from, on the one hand, the odd combination of  the multilevel, private indoor gyms found in the urban core of numerous cities, and the indisputable if disturbing success of McDonaldâ€™s â€œPlaylandsâ€, which are often the only recreational sites in many poorer urban U.S. areas.  The application of the â€œhighest and best useâ€ logic of real estate development can lead to the creation of more useintensiveâ€”and active (aerobic)models of public recreation space. The HYPOPARK provides more activities and square footage on a parcel of land roughly 1/3 the size of a comparable conventional park.  The cost is further reduced due to lower maintenance costs.<p>


</p>HYPOPARK offers a more healthcentered set of uses as counterpart to the more passivelyprogrammed traditional park. Its wider variety of newer, more individually formatted and small team sport and exercise venues, which would range from parkour courses to shuffleboard, are aimed at attracting the increasing range of active lifestyles and activities that characterize urban culture todayâ€”especially amongst our youthâ€”something not provided for in the more passive low density (picnicking, dogwalking, etc.) spaces of the traditional park. It is enclosed in brightly colored chainlink fencing. Play structures are made of a range of materials: perforated metal (climbing); steel bars/railings/poles; synthetic wood decking (upper levels); and chain â€œnetsâ€. The ground level would be predominantly recycled rubber, sand and other soft, resilient and easily maintained surfaces.<p>


</p>The HYPOPARK is not just aimed at personal health; it equally addresses that of the community, through the concentration of activity that it will attract, especially after school, when many children in unsafe areas have no place for supervised play. It will be at once a visual and a social focus for its neighborhood, the absence of which is a significant factor contributing to the lack of wellness of many areas of Los Angeles. Rather than being an â€œempty centerâ€ of a neighborhood, as many large parks can be, the tall and compact HYPOPARK will be a focal point. A new kind of â€œservice stationâ€, its also includes supplemental amenities aimed at prolonging the duration of each visit and drawing incidental traffic, such as vending machines selling natural juices and snacks, and a bike repair and rental station.  And because the outdoor facility is enclosed, it can be closed during offhours, so as not to become a haven for undesirable activities.<p>





</p>The HYPOPARK is a publicprivate venture: it is small enough to fit on any of the now plentiful supply of surplus public parcels (parking lots, etc. owned by former redevelopment agencies), constructed and managed by the Cityâ€™s Parks and Rec Dept, and/or in partnership with a preidentified private entity in the manner of the now commonplace adoptahighway programs, i.e. national sports retailers (Sports Chalet, Sports Authority, REI), as well as local â€œboarding housesâ€ (Volcom, Hurley) or area hospitals (Kaiser), while oversight might be provided by adjacent fire and police stations, in the mode of the Police Activities League.<p>","</p>1.

3102258,2013258,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Dream.html,Dream Resource Center, Education,"This year, the Dream Resource Center (DRC), within the UCLA Labor Center, is launching a new highschool educational program in partnership with the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Our goal is to develop an immigrant rights curriculum that focuses on contemporary issues facing immigrant youth. The program includes high quality academic enrichment, parent and family involvement, civic engagement and social action, intergenerational leadership development, and nutritional and mental health.





The curriculum will integrate the two publications that have captured the voices of immigrant youth throughout the country, Underground Undergrads and Undocumented and Unafraid, along with a book that highlights the history of the Los Angeles labor and immigrant rights leader, Miguel Contreras: Legacy of a Labor Leader.  Highschool youth will be exposed to contemporary social issues and gain the unique opportunity to connect their classroom learning to community empowerment. 





The program will involve highschool students from grades 9â€“12, with the intention of engaging a community of new leaders. Ninthgraders will be able to form an early connection to their new school and peers, while older students will be able to mentor the younger students and impart the knowledge gained from their high school tenure.  Coordinators of the outreach program are active members and leaders of the immigrant youth movement and bring with them the experience and knowledge to overcome economic, social, and linguistic barriers to maintaining good grades in high school, excelling in college, and becoming models for the next generation. They will design curriculum for immigrant youth at various high school campuses in the Los Angeles area. 





The DRC was created to promote access to education for undocumented immigrant youth. As an immigrantyouthled project, the DRC has played a significant education and research role in two immigrant youth movement victories recently celebrated in the United States: the California Dream Act, a policy that provides financial aid to undocumented college students, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama administrative action directing federal immigration authorities to defer deportation and provide twoyear work permits for undocumented youth. These victories were won by undocumented immigrant youth, and the leaders of this movement are in the best position to provide outreach and education to their peers regarding policy changes that affect their access to work permits and higher education. 





Both of these victories were won by the courage, determination, and perseverance of immigrant youth themselves, without staff, lobbyists, or funding.  With these new policies in place, now is the time to educate the next generation of immigrant youth about their educational and employment opportunities. 





Some Los Angeles innercity high schools have up to a 30 percent undocumented immigrant student population. Yet to date, there are no ongoing programs within the LA Unified School District to educate these youth, their parents, teachers, and counselors about how to take advantage of DACA and the California Dream Act. The curriculum being developed and piloted this summer will be the first of its kind and would contribute to the development of ongoing education and outreach to encourage undocumented immigrant youth in Los Angeles to pursue their dreams in higher education. 


","In the last several years, the UCLA Labor Center has emerged as a national resource for undocumented immigrant students and immigrant youth leadership development. The Labor Center has conducted research on immigrant youth, actively promoted their civic engagement, taught the first courses in the country on undocumented students, and published two nationally acclaimed books written by and about undocumented students. The first, Underground Undergrads: UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012â€“2013 academic school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for immigrant students across the country. 





The Labor Center engages in other activities to address the needs of undocumented immigrant youth, including hosting Dream Summer, the first national internship program for undocumented students.  This program has placed 250 students and awarded a total of $1.25 million for interns to continue their education.  Through Dream Summer, interns learn skills and build the capacity of host organizations focused on specific issues or campaigns such as health and health care access, civic engagement, education, youth leadership, and LGBTQ issues. 





Both Dream Summer and the Undocumented and Unafraid book publication and tour have been models for developing online resources that have connected with thousands of undocumented immigrant students throughout the country who are in need of basic information. These activities are just two among several at the Dream Resource Center that have served to create an online and inperson support network to give undocumented students the encouragement they need to pursue their dreams. 


",Los Angeles Unified School District; United We Dream; Dream Team Los Angeles; Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund. ,"The Dream Resource Center will evaluate our outreach project and measure success in three ways: 1) Participant feedback from highschool youth; 2) Partner response from school staff, city representatives, and local immigrant youth organizations; and 3) Operational assessment.  





The specific evaluation processes are below.


1)	The Dream Resource Center will conduct surveys with participants at educational events and trainings to learn about their assessment of the materials, presentations, and accessibility of our facilitators, along with their suggestions for improvements. We will also collect data on the number of attendees. 





2)	We will interview partners about their experiences in the collaboration, troubleshoot during project implementation, and assimilate their recommendations into the development of new collaborative efforts. The DRC also measures the success of partnerships by interest from new partners. 





3)	The DRCâ€™s Dream Summer was recently evaluated by an external team and will apply the assessment of our strengths and shortcomings to operations and implementation of other projects. In addition, the DRC conducts periodic assessments of programs by debriefing with staff, reviewing participant surveys, and analyzing attendance statistics. Evaluations guide the DRCâ€™s strategic planning process to improve operations, partnership development, and project implementation. 





The overall success of our outreach will be measured by the number of undocumented youth who graduate from high school, apply to college, and participate in activities and projects with local organizations. 


","Los Angeles will benefit from higher rates of highschool graduation and increased civic engagement among youth.  The proposed project will thereby advance the UCLA Labor Centerâ€™s commitment to promote access to higher education for underrepresented communities. We expect our Dream Resource Center model will provide information, leadership development opportunities, and infrastructure for building support networks among immigrant youth to be replicated on campuses throughout the city. This will increase opportunities for immigrant youth to participate in leadership development programs, promote civic engagement, and encourage greater access to higher education.





Positive immigration policy change is currently being debated nationally and will happen within the near future. Immigrant youth leaders trained through this program will achieve their educational goals, emerge as leaders in their own communities, and advance policies and programs to promote immigrant integration. 


","In 2050, Los Angeles will embrace the rich immigrant traditions of our city. Immigrant youth will have full access to educational and employment opportunities, and former students who benefitted from the work of the Dream Resource Center will have gone on to become college professors, doctors, scientists, engineers, lawyers, teachers, artists, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and members of school boards, state legislatures, and the US Congress. 





Los Angeles 2050 will be a worldclass city filled with immigrants and children of immigrants from throughout the world. The rich immigrant traditions will have energized our educational institutions, our economy, and the cultural life of the city. Los Angeles 2050 will serve as a beacon of hope for the country and for the world, as a city where human relations are harmonious, where the economy is thriving, and where immigrants and their children and grandchildren are fully integrated in all aspects of the cityâ€™s economic and social life.

3102259,2013259,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Clark.html,Arts on the Grounds: L.A. Escena Performance Series,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"<p>The UCLA William Andrews Clark Memorial Library plans to transform community engagement with the arts, and in particular with the Hispanic tradition of classical theater through a series called L.A. Escena,  part of the Clark Libraryâ€™s Arts on the Grounds project.  Arts on the Grounds is the first stage of a larger strategy for engaging lowerincome and diverse communities from the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles. Our initial strategy for increasing engagement will begin with a performance program set in the Clark Libraryâ€™s five acres of gardens, public spaces, outdoor â€œrooms,â€ and lawns. Performances will target local audiences through modern interpretations of classical texts, bilingual productions and adaptations of Spanish plays, and familyfriendly productions. </p>





<p>This initiative will open in June 2013 with L.A. Escena. Focusing on classical theater in Spanish and adaptations for Los Angeles audiences, this series will extend the Clark Libraryâ€™s reach, inspiring artists and audiences to explore plays from the Hispanic tradition, and particularly Spainâ€™s Golden Age, in bilingual formats and outdoor performances. As a first step in introducing broader audiences to this body of work, Playwrightsâ€™ Arena, spearheaded by Jon Lawrence Rivera, will commission notable local playwrights active in the Latino community to adapt classics of the Spanish Golden Age for contemporary Los Angeles audiences. The series will launch with a festival of staged readings designed to introduce audiences to the treasures of Lope de Vega, Cervantes, Sor Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz and more. Playwrights include Oliver Mayer, Velina Hasu Houston, and Luis Alfaro. Renowned actors will present scenes of their adaptations this summer, to be followed by one or more full productions in Summer 2014. </p>





<p>The UCLA Clark Library is located in the ethnically and economically diverse community of West Adams, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, with multiple Historic Preservation Overlay Zones.  The community includes Latino, white, AfricanAmerican, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native American residents, ranging from wealthy to lowincome, and is a center of AfricanAmerican gay life. West Adams thus embodies the racial, economic and social diversity of L.A. </p>





<p>Despite its central location and partial gentrification, however, the neighborhood is still far removed from much of the cultural activity in Los Angeles. We plan to remedy this through the Arts on the Grounds initiative which will welcome residents to outdoor performances, particularly encouraging the exploration of the cityâ€™s Hispanic heritage.</p>


","The Library has offered a range of public programs and theater productions, taking advantage of the collectionâ€™s focus on the 17th and 18thcentury, one of the great ages of classical drama. Most recently, the Clark Library partnered with L.A. Theater Works (LATW) to present â€œPride and Prejudiceâ€ in the Libraryâ€™s drawing room for a live audience and radio broadcast. Other indoor performances have included the operatic scena â€œIl Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorindaâ€ (with Opera UCLA), and William Wycherleyâ€™s â€œThe Country Wifeâ€ in collaboration with UCLAâ€™s School of Theater, Film and Television. Theater performances build on the tremendous success of the Clarkâ€™s Chamber Music Series, now entering its 20th year, which draws over 700 people each year. ","We partner with neighborhood associations, local theater companies, and various departments on the UCLA campus for outreach programs serving neighborhood schools.  These include the UCLA Lab School and the School of the Artsâ€™ Visual and Performing Arts Education program. Oliver Mayer of USCâ€™s School of Dramatic Arts is an additional partner. Our initial theater partner for L.A. Escena is Playwrightsâ€™ Arena, led by Jon Lawrence Rivera.  In 201314, we will partner with East L.A. Classical Theater for performances targeting K12 audiences. With the West Adams Heritage Association (WAHA), we have also established a joint committee to explore how the library can address the cultural needs of the community and potential collaborative projects. ","<p>We will evaluate Arts on the Grounds and measure success in three ways: </p>


<p>1)	Audience attendance and feedback: The Clark Library conducts surveys with audiences at events to learn about their reactions to performances, accessibility of our programs, and their suggestions for future programming. We also collect data on the number of attendees.</p>


<p>2)	Partner response: We interview partners about their experience in the collaboration, troubleshoot during a season, and build their recommendations into development of new collaborative efforts. The Clark Library also measures the success of partnerships by interest from new partners.</p>


<p>3)	Operational assessment: The library periodically conducts assessments of programs by debriefing with Clark Library staff, reviewing audience surveys, and analyzing attendance statistics. These are generally annual evaluations that guide a process to identify shortcomings of past events and programs and develop strategies to improve implementation. </p>


<p>Additional assessments will come from interviews with neighborhood groups and school representatives from the West Adams district. The overall success of this initiative will be measured by the number of attendees and media hits of the pilot season.</p> ","Arts on the Grounds unique programming will actively engage the diverse community in the West Adams district, UCLA students, scholars, and K12 school groups with intersections between literature and the performing arts. The program aims to increase the opportunities for engagements with art for local residents in lowincome neighborhoods, address a growing demand for performing arts in the West Adams district, and foster partnerships between humanities scholars and performing arts practitioners. The partners and productions in the series that we will pilot in Summer 2013 have been selected based on their appeal to Spanishspeaking audiences in local communities and are designed to engage youth from lowincome families in cultural enrichment. We expect to reach a total audience of 8001000 during the Summer 2013 Arts on the Grounds series. Each theater event will be promoted by both our theatrical partners and the Clark Library, and we will work with the West Adams Heritage Association to advertise the events in their newsletter and other appropriate neighborhood outlets. ","In 2050 we envision thriving artistic communities throughout all area of Los Angeles.  We believe that arts and culture has an integral role to play in the development of individuals and communities, and also acts as a bridge between groups who would otherwise not interact.  We see the Clark Library playing a role in this evolution through its Arts on the Grounds program by becoming a central hub of cultural vitality in the West Adams district of Los Angeles â€“ bringing people together to celebrate their heritage and traditions through performances of all kinds."

Los Angelesâ€™ social connectedness deficit is rooted in our poorly maintained car dominated streets, alleys and neighborhoods.  Most Angelenos wish for a more walkable, safer, neighborly environment, but see no way they can make a change when even the simplest public space project seems to take years and hundreds of thousands of dollars. 





We think we have found a solution: DIY social spaces created by volunteers in a few months for a few thousand dollars.   In the last year we have, brought neighbors together in five locations in Boyle Heights to use their DIY ingenuity  and innovation creating create shared spaces of social connectedness. This included transforming streets and alleys by building physical improvements and organizing activities to reclaim the space. Our vision for 2013 is to organize Boyle Heights neighbors to build DIY social spaces across the community so every resident lives within two blocks of a local commons . Our project will also create the tools and materials that will enable us to help Angelenos replicate this process across the city. Neighbors building their own shared social space, builds social connectedness in many ways. 





â€¢	Barn Raisingâ€” This is where neighbors share time, tools, skills, food. Together, they build relationships that flourish long after the last nail is driven.   


â€¢	Claiming and Shaping Shared Space â€“ Through the project neighbors create their own public space which deepens their commitment to the neighborhood and recruits other residents to do the same. 


â€¢	Sparking Conversations and Relationships   Over time there will be 100s  of spontaneous connections made by residents who meet or cross paths in the space during the course of the projectâ€™s life changing the quality of relationships between neighbors.





Our process engages the local neighborhoodâ€™s untapped potential by bringing people together to address common neighborhood problems.  We start by building Networks of Neighborhood Committees, composed of neighborhood residents  that make a commitment to work together to make positive changes in their local neighborhood.  These changes include building a team that creates opportunities to get to know your neighbors and to  together to build  simple DIY projects that have long lasting and transformative impacts in the community. In Boyle Heights, we began organizing activities on our streets and in our alleys such as regular cleanups, movie nights, mercados, and childrens activities.  This started to transform spaces that had been  deemed unsafe into  healthy, thriving, and desirable places to live where neighbors can play, be active, and engage in constructive community building activities. 





However organized activities alone cannot fully complete a transformation. When no activity is occurring, the streets and alleys can look and feel empty.  We have realized that we needed to reinforce the impact of our activities with physical improvements to create and promote  sustainable active and healthy alleys. In addition, given  limited municipal resources, we found ways to make the physical improvements that led into immediate changes with low investment , and without waiting for it to be done for us, but rather by doing it ourselves.  


 


To provide an example, one of our neighborhood committees, called Bienestar, identified a specific alley as problematic.  It was unlit, dark, filled with potholes, and painted with graffiti.  Residents also complained about the need for space next to their homes in which children could play safely. Last year, this committee  came up with a plan to transform the alley into  a small plaza.  They organized regular cleanups and removed the graffiti.  The youth in the neighborhood designed a mural and received permission to paint it on one of the buildings.  As the city did not have resources to repave the alley, neighbors was able to raise money to buy materials and the residents donated the labor and repaved the alley themselves.  They also installed solar lighting and designed and built planters.  Finally, they finished painting a design on the floor of the repaved alley. Today, when the residents want to bring their children outside they use the planters to close the alley to cars and create a small plaza in front of the mural they painted.  This was all accomplished with 6 months, less than $3,200.  By adding countless volunteer hours, the considerable skills of neighborhood residents and the passion and ownership that comes from doing it yourself, we were able to transform an alley for a small fraction of the time and resources the City or anyone else would spend to have the same impact. This is an example of neighbors taking initiative coming together to rebuild their city one block at a time.


","In 2000 we won a Best Practice award for our community organizing from the United Nationsâ€™ Huairou Commission. In our model, solutions to a problem are developed by those most affected.  It places the community first and at the center of our work. We take a bottom up approach. We start with the communityâ€™s understanding of their problems and engage the community in addressing these issues. We organize block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood and bring this network together.  We do this through reflection, action, analysis and start again with each phase bringing new information.  Through this process community members learn to negotiate and prioritize their demands amongst themselves. Our organizing campaigns as identified by our community members include the following: preservation of healthy affordable housing; the right to clean water; the right to clean air; and the right to safe and healthy neighborhoods. 





The Bienestar committees success in transforming their alley clearly demonstrated the potential for creating healthy alleys through the doityourself community action our long organizing history makes possible.   In addition to this we have the following accomplishments:





EJ and Neighborhood Health and Safety


o	Neighborhood base improvements,  Installed physical improvements to transform the use of 5 alleys in Boyle Heights and identified 6 more to begin transformation this year


o	Negotiated to reduce costly police engagement in neighborhood activity in our community


o	Reduced  violence and fear on Fickett St without criminalization or police intervention through neighborhood occupation


o	Worked with Environmental Justice Coalition for Water and Assemblyman John Perez to pass a state law allowing for the City of Maywood to have more regulatory powers over the water companies


o	Gained support from Assemblyman Rendon to develop a policy to create a public water district in Maywood


o	Organized and won two new parks in the City of Maywood; 


o	Passed a law in the City of Maywood that allows street vendors to obtain vending permits;  


o	Reprioritized how the City of LA distributed resources for basic services;








Housing


o	Trained and developed  tenants to understand RSO Regulations and the cityâ€™s inspection processes.


o	Identified and worked with 188 tenants during their inspection processes in the last year


o	With LACAN, formed an LA Citywide multicultural coalition that puts homeless, tenants, and public housing residents voices at the front of the struggle to expand rent control rights and protect public housing.


o	Successful in swearing in one of our members as a Housing Authority of City of LA Board of Commissioner (HACLA);


o	Stopped HACLAâ€™s elimination of public housing for a 3 year period;


o	Passed 2 advisory measures in Maywood protecting families from the demolition of their homes; 


o	Organized, drafted, and passed Just Cause Ordinance in the City ","Union de Vecinos has a seventeen year history working in Boyle Heights.  We formed in 1996 with 36 members and have grown to an organization that works in East LA and the City of Maywood. We understand the importance of working in collaborations with other organizations in order to reach the scale and impact we aim to achieve.  For this project we will be partnering with Shared Spaces, a landscape architecture partnerships. We will also be working with local business especially those that line the alleys along the commercial corridors in Boyle Heights. Other partners include the  LA Human Right to Housing Collective,   Green LA, and the artist collective Ultrared.","Our criteria for evaluating our progress is rooted in three core questions: 1) Has our strategy engaged, empowered, and activated new community residents to participate in the project?; 2) Have our strategies strengthened relationships and collaborations between local neighborhoods? and 3) Did we transform the alleys into  safe and healthy environments?  If not, what were the obstacles to accomplishing this?   Evaluation of the work occurs monthly with staff and community members.  We also will review the number of alleys transformed, whether the alleys have a core group of community members committed to maintaining them, the costs and labor involved, and where additional resources can be found.","Our vision for 2050 is a city where DIY social spaces are more common than gas stations, Starbucks, liquor stores or police cars.  A city where each neighborhood, each set of blocks, has its neighborhood space where people regularly meet, catchup on the news and gossip, hatch new projects and just enjoy being connected. 





The challenge in LA is that even the small park or plaza can take years to get approved and built and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.   In contrast, our Community Living Rooms or Salas Publicas, just take weeks to build and cost less than $5,000.   The keys elements are:


â€¢	Tapping neighborhood volunteers wealth of knowledge, skills and commitment.


â€¢	Creating and building simple, functional designs together using basic,  available materials.


â€¢	Taking advantage of available landâ€”in alleys, sidewalksidewalks, adjacent to churches, temples, nonprofits and collaborating businesses


â€¢	Improving spots where people already gatherâ€”at bus stops, by the corner store, at the entrance to the alley.





This project pulls people out of their homes, brings neighbors together to work together, builds social relationships while transforming an underutilized space into a play space for the community.  It combines DIY culture with community building, with members donating their own time and labor to beautify and change how they use their alleys and local spaces. All of LA also benefits in the following ways from our project:





â€¢	engages and demonstrates how a small group of neighbors can create their own mobile source of space given limited space across the city


â€¢	triggers a chain reaction of neighborhood change â€“ once neighbors see  the changes they make, they join or invite  others to build new projects.


â€¢	It challenges the car culture â€“ to get out and work with your neighbors to build something that is shared in the local neighborhood.


â€¢	It creates safe streets and neighborhood engagement in creating in addressing public safety


â€¢	It builds community networks across communities


â€¢	It is an intergenerational approach involving neighbors of all ages and all backgrounds.


","Success for us would be that every alley in Boyle Heights would have a group of dedicated community members working to maintain and transform their alley.  Success would mean that there are physical improvement projects that were built in the alleys such as solar lighting, greening of the alleys, street furniture, bulletin boards, etc.  Success would mean that    community members would organize activities in the alleys so that the space was not just a place for cars and trash but a place to come together and build community. Success would mean that other communities in Los Angeles would grasp this form of transformative change and replicate it in their local neighborhoods."
3102261,2013261,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/TheCreativeLab.html,Fuel LAs Creative Economy Help UNIQUE LA Build The Creative Lab!,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"UNIQUE LA has helped over 4000 artists/designers/entrepreneurs increase revenues and become sustainable businesses by selling their goods to the public. At the same time we've created a cultural institution and thriving community that supports local art, design, craft. It's time to take the next step in our mission of helping LA's art and design community... Our plan is to open the UNIQUE LA Creative Lab, a co-work & creative event space that would provide the much-needed tools that creative small business owners need in order to become sustainable and grow successfully.





Creatives who work for themselves (artists, designers, furniture makers, freelancers, film makers, writers, etc.), are actually entrepreneurs and small business owners. They are curious, innovative and visionary... They also have to wear ALL the hats when owning a business - they are in fact their own PR firm, accounting department, marketing engine, HR manager. It's a lot to take on. They need help, guidance and a place to connect with a like-minded community so that they can thrive not just as artists but business owners. Someone who is creative should be able to be great at what they do, and make a great living doing it.


  


UNIQUE LAâ€™s Creative Lab will help ensure LAâ€™s arts and culture community is growing strong, and growing smart. The Creative Lab will achieve this in two ways. First, it will provide a membership-based co-work environment, allowing people to share creative office and studio space (complete with a kitchen, board room, photo studio and more). And second, The Creative Lab will have an event space that will offer a diverse range of monthly and weekly programming, from workshops to a speaker series to parties and special events. All curated to ensure members and the public have access to continuing education, networking opportunities and inspiration. 





Every month we will feature a keynote speaker from world-famous artists to authors. Monthly workshops will range from â€œHow to Find Investorsâ€ to â€œDIY Public Relationsâ€ to â€œUtilizing Social Media to Increase Profitsâ€. Members will be invited to networking events with editors, to help them gain press attention. Trade show representatives will host How To seminars, helping designers learn how to grow by selling wholesale, instead of direct to consumer. Special events such as fashion shows will celebrate local talent and showcase new design and art. Imagine the amazing impact one space can have, when it TEACHES multiple generations how to be creative and make a living! Even better, it encourages and shows how to become a business that grows to support multiple employees!





Aside from having an astounding impact on Arts & Culture in LA, The Creative Lab will actually touch on and help all eight sectors listed in the Goldhirsh Foundationâ€™s LA2050 Report. Through programming, we will curate meaningful conversation, activities and hands-on workshops surrounding all eight areas â€“ for instance we will host a â€˜Volunteer Fairâ€™ where local non-profits (from education to health to arts) can connect with members looking for places to volunteer. 





UNIQUE LA's Creative Lab is a ground-breaking new idea. The 2012 OTIS Report states ""there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in LA than any other city at any other time in the history of civilization."" It's time LA got a space designed to ensure those people - the creatives that are fueling the economy - are well-trained, inspired and ready to grow.   


","UNIQUE LA has created the largest buy local design show in the country - and is the only show to curate and show-off local-made talent. We have brought international attention to LA and its great makers (press mentions have included Details Magazine, Elle France, Uppercase). In four years we've had amazing successes and have expanded in many ways, but I think these numbers illustrate the great impact we've had.





- 232,000 people have attended UNIQUE shows


- We've provided a platform for sales and exposure for over 8000 independent designers + artists


- Occupied a total of 424,000 square feet! 


- Produced shows in 3 cities, LA/NYC/SF 


- An estimated $9.3 million has been spent at UNIQUE shows (all that money goes right back into the local economy)","We expect to include local designers and organizations, as well as some of our corporate partners such as West Elm and Square to help us in creating the space. We also plan to create a great Board of Directors to help mentor, assist with programming and more.","Success will be measured by how the Unique Creative Lab directly


affects communities in the LA region.  Indicators will be:


1) Attendance of workshops and events


2) Membership to co-work space


3) Press and media attention already engaging in Unique LA


4) Evaluation forms to hear from members and participants


5) Innovative ways to reach the public based on collaborative ideas


coming from the Unique Creative Lab","The Unique Creative Lab will directly impact Los Angeles is multiple


ways and will benefit, and further fuel all sectors of the growing


creative economy:





1)   By directly increasing the amount of small business owners and


entrepreneurs in the LA region.





2)   By providing applicable resources for individuals, groups,


organizations and communities to see their ideas to fruition.





3)   By creating a diverse center of collaboration that reflects on


and includes all demographics necessary in accomplishing a more


creative and sustainable LA.





4)   By providing curated programing to the public that will generate


valuable and innovative discussion at a grassroots level.





5)   By providing a co-work space available to creative professionals


from across the US and the world, as allowing them to participate in


the mission and goals of the Unique Creative Lab.





6)   By bringing national awareness and media attention to our


community and the joint mission of LA2050 and the Unique Creative Lab.





7)   By becoming a successful and inspirational model of action for


other communities and cities to follow.","In the year 2050 the image of ""the starving artist"" would no longer exist. We have grown to educate artists and creatives not just in art theory and practice, but also in business. Essentially we've shown creatives how to be entrepreneurs, ensuring a successful and thriving creative economy. There are more artists and also more small businesses run by artists. When asked what they'd like to be when they grow up, children give answers such as Furniture Designer and Architect just as often as Doctor and Lawyer. Our view of 2050 is that we've grown LA's creative economy to be the best in the world, with bright stars and smart business owners. The Artist is no longer starving but successful and happy."
3102262,2013262,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/SkidRow100.html,100 in 100: Skid Row Innovates!, Housing,"PROBLEM :: Firstcome, firstserved. That is how many homeless services are given out. Who can blame them? The lines are unending, and homeless providers are busy. As a result, those with the greatest need for supports often get passed over or aren't even able to make it to the line. In a recent survey, 62% of the 532 individuals found and surveyed sleeping in Skid Row were found to have been on the streets for years and struggling with severe disability.





IDEA :: Create realtime lists of those experiencing homelessness and realtime lists of housing resources so that the two lists can be matched quickly and effectively. This will:


Help homeless providers do what they do best. Help our homeless neighbors access housing that fits. Turn the housing swap meet into a housing Match.com.





TIMELINE :: Work with existing providers to develop a beta system in Skid Row within 100 days. Test it by housing 100 of the hardesttohouse in those 100 days. Work at refining it for eventual Countywide use in the following 100 days.





IMPACT :: This will dramatically reduce homelessness for the most vulnerable, reduce unit vacancies, and reduce unit costs by more efficiently matching the supply and demand of housing.





In short, this is the system we need to end homelessness in Los Angeles.





(*More benefits listed in project benefit section)","Two years ago, United Way worked with the Business Leaders Task Force to launch Home For Good, an action plan to end chronic and veteran homelessness by 2016. Given our strong homeless partners, instead of administering homeless services, we focused on improving the homeless systems that hamper the work of our partners. We have seen tremendous results in our work together over these past two years:





â€¢ Leadership: Over 125 leaders from a broad crosssection of nonprofit, public, and philanthropic organizations, including the Mayor of LA and all 5 of our County Supervisors, signed onto the Home For Good plan.





â€¢ Funding: $5 million from 16 private funders was leveraged to secure $100 million from 7 public funders, creating the first ever Funders Collaborative for permanent supportive housing in LA County.





â€¢ Awareness: Over 20,000 volunteers have participated in HomeWalk, an annual 5k to end homelessness.





â€¢ Systems Change: The time it takes for a homeless veteran to move  from the street into a home was reduced by 2 months.





â€¢ Housing: Well over 5,000 chronically homeless persons as well as an additional 2,000 homeless veterans were permanently housed.





We are also proud to work with the Rapid Results Institute (RRI) and their 100day model. RRI uses a model that challenges communities to quickly and collaboratively design complex systems and create lasting systems change within 100 days.





RRI has worked globally to use the catalysts of network support, a timelimited process, clear goals and the expertise of line staff to engineer remarkable results. Those successes (all in 100 days) include:





â€¢ Reducing the days required for placing housing homeless vets in Detroit from 143 days to 34 days (76% decrease) in collaboration with the 100k Homes Campaign





â€¢ Reducing operating costs for CALPERS (CA public pension) by $99.6 million (annualized) 





â€¢ Getting 15,400 people in Sierra Leone tested for HIV in 100 days, compared to 1,000 in the previous 3 years





Here in the US and in LA, they also work closely with Community Solutions' 100K Homes Campaign to transform homeless service systems.","We are proud to work with all the partners necessary for this great task with the addedguidance of Community Solutions/100K Homes, Rapid Results Institute, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.





DESIGN TEAM:  LA Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), Housing Authority of the City of LA (HACLA), LA County Depart. of Mental Health (DMH), Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH), LA County Dept. of Health Services (DHS), US Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA)





WORK TEAMS: DMH, Downtown Women's Center, Exodus Recovery, HACLA, Homeless Health Care LA, LAMP Community, LA Christian Health Centers, Los Angeles Mission, LAHSA, Midnight Mission, Skid Row Housing Trust, SRO Housing Corporation, SHARE!, St. Vincent DePaul,  Weingart Center Association, VA ","Success will mean we quickly and easily move people from streets to housing.





In order to get there, we will track these primary indicators during our first 100day beta test: 





# of homeless persons housed


# of days between a person being identified on the streets and given his/her keys


# of chronically homeless persons filling out housing applications 


# of units/vouchers dedicated to this housing system


# of persons matched through this system





To test this beta system, we are aiming for 100 chronically homeless adults from the Skid Row community to be matched and housed during our beta phase.


","SHORTTERM IMPACT :: New York's Times Square ended homelessness by starting with the anchors and strategically providing housing for them. In this beta test, we will be housing 100 persons from Skid Row who have been homeless for years, many for 10 years+.





LONGTERM IMPACT :: The real impact, though, will come from taking this system of matching and applying it Countywide. This will result in:





* Light in the Tunnel: This system will allow our homeless providers to work effectively at ending homelessness. If you can imagine having to book a flight without Expedia, that is effectively what it feels like for case managers to try to find housing for their clients today.





* Cost Savings: Chronically homeless Angelenos consume 75% of the $875 million in public resources that go toward homelessness. Local studies have shown that being able to offer them permanent supportive housing in a more strategic and targeted way will cost us 40% less.





* Lower Vacancies: Having a realtime list of housing and homeless persons desiring housing will ensure that our valuable housing resources donâ€™t sit unoccupied for a second longer than necessary.


 


* Housing Resources: The promise of such systems, in terms of reduced costs, improved targeting and enhanced outcomes, is so dramatic that HUD has asked all communities to create and implement these systems. HUD is more likely to offer housing resources to communities with such systems infusing more capital for housing into our region.  





* Civic Pride: Shedding the label of being the homeless capital will allow others to see the other valuable assets Los Angeles has to offer the world.","Success for us would mean that in 2050, everyone in Los Angeles has a home.





It would also mean that should anyone become homeless for a brief period, there are the systems in place to help that person quickly back on their feet





No more Skid Rows.

3102263,2013263,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/poroushousing.html,Porous Housing 2050: Housing Typology for DTLA in 2050, Housing,"Over the past few years, the City of Los Angeles has been making ardent, varied attempts at revitalizing its Downtown district. For instance, contemporary cultural nuclei such as The Disney Concert Hall, The Broad Museum have been generating much public interest. Furthermore redevelopment of neighborhoods and renewed events in the Artistsâ€™ district has stirred more awareness so as to cajole the vivacity of the City of Angeles. These attempts assert an indirect impetus at restraining the issue of landuse but do not solve the fundamental problem.


As the incumbent urban sprawl deters mobility in Los Angeles, most commercial and recreational infrastructure has moved to suburban areas due to the availability of affordable, expansive land, and easy access. This in turn coerces Angelinos to use their personal motor vehicles to access downtown and its satellite facilities which is all the more prominent on weekends.


The Central Business District (CBD) Decline Phenomenon is becoming graver, as the Downtown is strictly utilized for business and commerce affairs but lacks much recreational activity thereafter. Fundamentally, it forces deficiency in pedestrian activity, causes traffic congestion, increased demand for parking spaces, lack of urban parks and public space which are inherently interrelated. Los Angeles is also the city with the largest homeless population with settlements in the Skid Row district bordering downtown. Unfortunately, the temperate climate and lack of assistance for the homeless has contributed to this precipitous growth of the Skid row district.


Our research is based on a futuristic vision for urban collective housing with emphasis on use in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). Through our research we hope to envision L.A.â€™s housing requirements for the future and develop new housing typologies to address these very requisites.


New typologies for urban collective housing demand an exhaustive study of contextual downtown parameters such as urbanism, architecture, landscape, ecology, and social culture. This paradigm is beset by the predominant terse or perhaps lack of, use of the district in nonbusiness hours. The research would work as a catalyst in arousing passion for the futuristic urban housing for the new era, far from the maximum units stacked prevalent woven into the fabric of the district.","In many instances, professional practice may have constraints that could be client driven or simply pertaining to ordinances and budgetary constraints. In my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape architecture to urban design and crossdisciplinary systems with locations in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities. When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.


In the Yongsan Park Masterplan, we proposed a project to ecologically regenerate an urban site that had been used as a military base for more than 100 years. Its location in central Seoul, as well as its proximity to Old Seoul eventually distorted its natural axis. The site needed to incorporate the historical situations of the Second World War, the Korean War, and the societal atmosphere which Korea was forced to face. Its solution demanded research about the ecology and sustainability inherent to the site. UNITEDLAB was fortunate enough to receive the ASLA Professional Award and an AIA LA Award for this project.


More recently, I developed a research project called â€˜Los Angeles Affordable Apartments,â€™ a multiunit residential prototype based on traditional village housing schemes. I proposed unit prototypes for the lowincome which compels pedestrian activity in DTLA. For a mobile city like Los Angeles, I believe this could be new typology that encourages such activity.


","We understand that such definitive research needs rich collaboration between disciplines to envision a worthy future for the city. It beseeches urban planners, designers, engineers, landscape architects, ecosystem specialists, sustainability scientists and most importantly city dwellers to engage and develop operatives to derive new typologies. 


Per the project agenda, we will let specialists conduct specific research separately about detailed themes or quantitative data to foster futuristic society. Yet, our methods will also require constant collaboration between theorists and practitioners to maintain a resolute course of action.","Predicting and evaluating the future of housing that positively influences the dynamism of a city should have an augmented forethought well beyond unscrambling present day challenges.


The pivotal attribute being that such a proposal should first catalyze fulfilling implementation and set a precedent for further research and predictions. 





We postulate that the evaluation for measurement of success will consist of three different scales: 


Firstly, we will gauge its value and degree of realization as an urban sited housing typology. Such a proposed typology will also be tested for its contribution to urban development, regeneration and revitalization. We will also assess how it solves downtown related problems in terms of urban planning or design on a macroscaled view point.


Furthermore, we will also assess how the expansions of additional functions such as green and public spaces interrelate with the housing program. These assessments will tiein with the development of social donation and welfare.


Secondly, the assessment will be a systematical research on a macro and microscale. Would this housing be planned for and be able to maintain or evolve with residentsâ€™ social participation for creating and vitalizing a community? How would the housing complex contribute or partake in the ecosystem and foster sustainability as well as selfreliance?


Lastly, at the microscale level, we will infer if this housing functions well? Is this housing typology architecturally aesthetic? Were the residents and community satisfied with the outcome? How feasible was its development?


","Developing an affordable multi housing complex would contribute to revitalizing DTLA in various ways; provide housing opportunities for low income Angelinos, create work opportunities, give hope to skid row dwellers to find affordable housing, assist in restoring urban beauty, support pedestrian activity for downtown vibrancy, provide equal housing and equal opportunity by creating a homogenous community devoid of social class or ethnic schisms.  


We feel that if a housing typology serves as more than just a place of residence and advocates itself as social housing, it promotes a sense of community thereby insinuating selfresilience and sustainability. This allows all residents to engage as active members of the community who can socialize without biases. This is particularly important because characteristically the homeless population and low income groups tend to be isolated from mainstream society. While executing this process, there is more possibility to develop on the expansive function of housing such as advanced correlations between housing and sustainability, landscapes, urbanscapes, infrastructure which would foster further evolved typologies.


Beyond generic housing complex, developing a new typology connected with public space, urban green space, or mixeduse would also serve as a catalyst to solve problems DTLA faces as urban collective housing which presently echoes a sense of reclusion from one another.


","We feel that creating social housing typologies will create a more multidimensional transition between the different districts in DTLA. In present day context, there is a stark visible contrast demarcating various districts and this is all the more clear when it comes to the Skid Row and its surrounding streets. We have already seen how there is renewed interest in livening the use of space in downtown and we believe that our suggested research and its inference will generate more interest for pedestrian activity and use of spaces that will never be desolate at different times. The three dimensionality of such a project will invite dwellers to walk more, socialize more, take public transportation and actively engage with the community. Not declined by urban sprawl, public spaces, plazas, residential, businesses will all be more pedestrianized with interaction from people of all age groups, ethnicities devoid of social segregations. We feel that it will present a social reclamation of the two dimensional demarcation and inherent decline while generating close ties between elaborately interweaved DTLA districts building a strong sense of communities."
3102264,2013264,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/BuildingBlocksLA.html,Building Blocks LA: changing the shape of Los Angeles through imaginative urban planning, Social Connectedness,"<p>Social connectedness in Los Angeles is influenced by the cityâ€™s built environment and how Angelenos come together to shape the city. To tap into the imagination of Angelenos for a more inclusive and connected city, an artplanningpolicy collaboration will hold 40 workshops throughout LA to allow diverse groups of residents to share ideas, bond and inspire each other by building physical models of how they want the city to look in coming decades. The project team will translate these creative models of LA into policy ideas to influence the comprehensive revision of the cityâ€™s zoning code that starts this year.</p>


<p>Zoning regulates how the hundreds of thousands of buildings and pieces of land that form Los Angeles can be used. By controlling physical places, zoning has sometimes kept less powerful socioeconomic or ethnic groups â€œin their placeâ€ at the margins of society. And, by favoring cars and private backyards over high quality public space, it has reduced the types of social interactions that build community. In a diverse city, we cannot afford to exclude some residents from amenities and opportunities or to wall people off from their neighbors. </p>


<p>The City of Los Angeles recently authorized a Comprehensive Zoning Revision to start in 2013. The last time that L.A. conducted a comprehensive update of its zoning rules was 1946. This upcoming revision process is therefore a â€˜once in a lifetimeâ€™ opportunity to change the DNA of land use in the City and shape Los Angeles as a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable place.</p>


<p>The Urban & Environmental Policy Institute and project partners Latino Urban Forum excel in convening people and organizations to envision and advocate for more just and livable places and policies.  <p>Everyone can be an urban planner because we all live in the city and have ideas to improve it. The workshops tap into peopleâ€™s emotions and creativity by making planning visual, tactile, and playful. Language, age, income, education, and planning knowledge do not raise barriers because the medium creates an equal playing field.</p>


<p>Participants assemble a medley of recycled, vibrant materials into threedimensional models of their ideal city, neighborhood street, public space, or building. By building with nondescript, found objects, participants are forced to be creative. Green yarn becomes parks, blue poker chips a river or ocean, and hair rollers are stood up for apartments or laid on their side for transit lines.</p>


<p>After building for twenty minutes, workshop participants have one minute to explain their model, and the vision behind it, to the group. As each person explains their model, project staff document the models and descriptions by taking notes, pictures and video.</p>


<p>After participants have completed and shared their individual models, they are asked to work together & create one group (or several small groups) model synthesizing all their visions. During this phase of the exercise, participants realize that they must draw from everyoneâ€™s vision. When done, groups share explain their joint models.</p>


<p>The project team will review images, notes and audio/visual records and â€˜tagâ€™ participantsâ€™ models and ideas to create a database of how residents want land use in LA to look and function in the future. We will write a report based on the workshop results and research into best practices, translating the models, explanations and tags into policy recommendations for the cityâ€™s zoning update. The report will focus on recommendations to make the city more inclusive and connected. For example. If participants build models and share visions highlighting the need for more diverse and affordable forms of housing, the report will highlight ways that zoning can increase the housing supply and raise funds for affordable housing.</p>


<p>The report will be shared with workshop participants, with community organizations and spaces that helped host workshops, and with city planners and policy makers who will shape and vote on new zoning rules.</p>


<p>Our project will advance social connectedness in several ways. First, the workshops will provide handson evidence to hundreds of Angelinos that, even if they are not trained as urban planners, they have a personal vision of what kind of city they want LA to become. This experience in creative city building will hopefully inspire more residents to get involved in planning discussions. Second, the workshops require collaboration with other participants, leading to shared envisioning of the future shape of the city. Third, by letting people build a model of their ideal urban form for LA, the process inspires a hopeful and positive outlook to changes in the built environment that is often lacking in the politics of land use.</p>


<p>Finally, translating the visions of hundreds of models of a more inclusive and connected city will provide a rich set of policy ideas to influence the zoning reform process.</p>","<p>UEPI is a social change organization at Occidental College that connects ideas and actions to create a more just, livable and green society. We focus on partnerships, research and policy advocacy in four areas: builtenvironment, food, globalization, and transportation.


Our accomplishments include:</p> 





<p>â€¢	Organizing the Progressive Los Angeles Network between 1998 â€“ 2002 to develop a shared agenda between environmental, labor, housing, transportation and other advocates and progressive academics to influence city policy.</p> 


<p>â€¢	Developing a farmtoschool model starting in 1997 to expand markets for local farmers and improve nutrition at k12 schools. Farm to School has grown into a national movement and UEPI has developed a farmtopreschool approach to reach younger children.</p> 


<p>â€¢	Organizing Arroyofest in 2003, the Los Angeles Bike Summit in 2009 and the Los Angeles Street Summit in 2010 to inspire greater collaborations among street advocates. </p> 


<p>â€¢	Organizing students and parents in LAUSD around nutrition issues to help create and advocate for passage of the Soda Ban, Healthy Snacks Motions and Obesity Prevention Motion. </p> 


<p>â€¢	Assisting community partners in developing policy agenda to reduce pollution from ports, rail, trucking and warehouses.</p> 


<p>â€¢	Helping develop a proposal to legalize sidewalk food vending in Los Angeles</p> ","<p>The Latino Urban Forum will lead most workshops and train other project staff to lead additional workshops.  Latino Urban Forum founder James Rojas has developed a successful imaginative urban planning process and has led numerous workshops in Los Angeles and around the world. </p>





<p>Workshops will be organized in collaboration with schools, universities, community organizations, senior centers, museums, art galleries, meet up groups, affordable housing developers, urban interventions, and other organizations interested in the future of Los Angeles. </p>","<p>Success will be measured by participation in our urban imagination workshops; by participantsâ€™ increased engagement on planning and policy issues; and by the projectâ€™s ability to influence on the zoning revision process. To quantify participation, we will count the number of people who take part in our workshop, where in the city they live, and their gender, age, and ethnic backgrounds. </p>





<p>We will alert participants to upcoming public meetings of the zoning revision process and ask those who attend as their first time at a planning session to let us know, allowing the project to determine whether our workshops inspire increased engagement with urban planning. </p>





<p>Project partners will inject ideas derived from the urban imagination workshops into the zoning revision process and track to what extent the key recommendations are being incorporated in drafts and final versions of the new zoning code. We will also quantify mentions of our project report in the traditional and social media.</p>","<p>Activating peopleâ€™s everyday experiences and imaginations to promote zoning reform is a chance to promote land uses that reflect the reality and aspirations of contemporary Los Angeles. LA is a place with a diverse population, an expanding transit system, a need for more affordable housing, and young people who value urban energy and living. Los Angeles has been held back by suburbanoriented land use rules that promoted driving and separated people and places. Better zoning and land use can weave neighborhoods together and help us become a city with more connected, equitable and healthy communities; more diverse and affordable forms of housing; more sustainable infrastructure; and more vibrant and creative places and economic activity.</p>





<p>Some zoning rules have had the effect of preventing lower income individuals and members of minority ethnic groups from living in places with more amenities, more economic opportunities and better schools. By excluding some social groups from the mainstream, land use rules contributed to clustering of poverty, unemployment and other challenges that have harmed communities for generations. </p>





<p>They also keep the city divided by race and class. The Los Angeles Metropolitan region is as economically unequal as the Dominican Republic and residential segregation by income has increased in Los Angeles over the past 30 years.  </p>





<p>Zoning rules make it difficult for informal dwellings and informal economic activities such as street vending to be legally integrated into the mainstream of society. Zoning for cars through minimum parking along with zoning that separates residences from jobs and businesses has made it more difficult for people to walk as part of their daily lives, reducing social interactions and use of public space.</p>





<p>Improved zoning rules inspired by residentsâ€™ visions and models of a transformed city and research into best practices can help Los Angeles reach its potential. Better land use rules can:</p>


<p>â€¢	Make streets and other public spaces into better places for socializing, strolling and civic engagement. </p>


<p>â€¢	Reduce driving, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions</p>


<p>â€¢	Legalize more diverse (and more affordable) types of housing in more places </p>


<p>â€¢	Learn from and legalize culturally diverse uses of the city


<p>â€¢	Develop local food sources</p>


<p>â€¢	Allow more experimentation with different ways of living and connecting in LA  </p>","<p>Success will be a Los Angeles that looks and feels more like the imaginative models that our workshop participants build. While we cannot know before hand exactly what kinds of future Los Angeles that residents will envision and create, we can predict based on some common themes and values from past workshops.</p> 





<p>LA 2050 will make space for people rather than for cars. When people build their ideal city, they often make sue to include more bike lanes/paths and transit and parks and plazas. They rarely pave their model with freeways and more parking than has ever been created in the history of the world (which Los Angeles was long known for). Los Angeles in 2050 will remove much of the parking that scars our landscape and will use some of that space for places where people can meet and interact. Humans are social animals, and the main attraction for people to be out in public spaces is other people. </p> 





<p>LA2050 will connect people and places rather than divide. People donâ€™t put gated communities or monotonous, unwalkable neighborhoods in their ideal Los Angeles. They place cool things close together and link up different parts of the city with paths, complete streets, greenbelts. Los Angeles in 2050 will have mixeduse zoning interwoven with open space. Diverse types of housing have reduced residential segregation. </p> 





<p>LA2050 will respect Los Angelesâ€™ iconic features but also allow residents to innovate and reshape the city. Past workshop participants highlighted and strengthened parts of LA that they love like the beaches or Griffith Park or street food or the Los Angeles River. But they sometimes create new types of urban forms and activities. LA2050 will allow us a stronger stake in its future, welcoming new ideas from young people, new immigrants and long time residents, creative professionals and ordinary Angelenos with ideas inspired by everyday urban experiences. Land use rules will be less rigid so that we can experiment and shape our homes, neighborhoods and city to reflect our hopes and desires. </p> "
3102265,2013265,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/NRT.html,Narrative Replacement Therapy: Reimagining the Heart of Los Angeles, Income & Employment,"<p>The story of a city is a narrative that links events to the place itself.  It also serves as a touchstone for citizens to reference when considering changes to the urban fabric.  But what happens when the story is no longer agreed upon let alone understood?  How can a city evolve without a clear sense of what it wants to be?   La Placita Nueva proposes to reestablish the historic core of LA as the center of the city, both mythologically as well as economically.  It would begin with an analysis of the area within a onekilometer diameter of the Plaza out of which a narrative would be developed â€“ one that builds on the story of the cityâ€™s founding to include a larger story encompassing the more recent past, the present, as well as its future.  This narrative would then stimulate project proposals for the area, drawing from the findings of the initial analysis to provide a common framework for decisionmaking & a vision for the future.</p>





<p>The analysis by Urban Macrosystems would look beyond the surface of the city to the web of confrontations & connections beneath.  Urban Macrosystems views cities as ecosystems â€“ more, as a system of systems whose myriad complex & unpredictable interactions shape the city.   Urban Macrosystems would reveal, for instance just how much territory is given over to asphalt & concrete in service of the automobile; it would expose the amount of acreage that the criminal justice system requires for a city this size; it would enumerate the religious & cultural institutions in the subject area, the retail establishments, the squarefootage of office space, industrial, & manufacturing warehouses as well as open space.  More importantly it would attempt to record how these systems interact â€“ or not; which imbalances are apparent & which are not; & finally, which parts of the economy are working & which are not.</p>  





<p>Urban Macrosystems draws inspiration from David George Haskellâ€™s book, The Forest Unseen, in which the biologist studies a forest ecosystem by spending a year looking past the visible plant & animal species to the microbial microcosm within a specific onemeter diameter circle in a forest.  Thus the analysis of the area surrounding La Placita can be thought of as The City Unseen, in which Urban Macrosystems jumps scales, trading the study of the microcosm for the macrocosm: while the evolution of a forest is determined in large part due to signaling & exchange at the microbial level, evolution of a city is the result of unknown millions of interactions of its inhabitants, most of which go unnoticed, unrecorded, even unremembered.  Nevertheless, a city might be seen as an archive of successive interactions between citizens â€“ with the buildings & associated infrastructure as the physical byproduct of these interactions.</p>





<p>Urban Macrosystems will assess how the systems themselves interact with each other â€“ is it at the level of the system or the individual?  Is the interaction oneon one, or are multiple players/systems involved?  Undoubtedly, it would emerge as a complex mix of all this & other contingencies yet to be discovered; but the crucial ingredient we would look for is a perceived imbalance in any interaction â€“ an injustice, an economic dissonance, even a passionately argued difference of opinion â€“ to provide a locus for intervention.  </p>





<p>Even a cursory look at the subject area reveals obvious disparities: the lack of shelter for the homeless around the Plaza, the sea of asphalt paving the blocks north of the Plaza; further out there is the 101 Freeway shearing the historic city center from the contemporary one, the massive buildings housing the criminal justice system, the fantastic new Grand Park that â€“ though activated during the day â€“ sits empty at night, bereft of local residential users; even further is the area around the LA River, once the source of water & food for the city, now paved in concrete.  These are the obvious imbalances; a more indepth study by Urban Macrosystems will surely uncover many more.</p>





<p>Once the imbalances have been identified, Urban Macrosystems will develop a new narrative that takes the received history but then augments it, drawing from its analysis to formulate a vision for the future.  If the story of a city is the narrative linking specific event â€“ interactions, really â€“ to a place, the new narrative might incorporate previously unknown interactions uncovered during analysis â€“ or dreams of future ones.  From this Urban Macrosystems will layout a comprehensive plan, attempting to reconcile imbalance throughout the subject area & implement a deeper sustainability with a few simple & bold proposals that hope to bring energy, excitement â€“ & jobs â€“ to the vital yet neglected heart of LA. The goal would to be to have a strong enough vision to attract the right blend of curious & enterprising minds to create the next great economy for this city, right here, in the heart of Los Angeles.</p>","<p>Urban Macrosystemsâ€™ partners have collaborated on several projects prior to its inception:</p>

<p>Jeff Chapman, Director â€“ Los Angeles Audubon Urban Nature Center</p>


<p>Juliette Bellocq, Graphic Designer â€“ Handbuilt Studios</p>","La Placita Nueva will have a series of successes, milestones on the way to full implementation.  The first milestone will be as the analysis is completed and the findings begin to appear on the Urban Macrosystems website; once the design is completed, the next milestone would be to present the proposals to both the Los Angeles City Council and the LA County Board of Supervisors.  Once the design is embraced by civic leaders and the business community, the next major milestone would be when the next economy â€“ whatever that might be â€“ springs up directly from this context.  The final success milestone will be when La Placita Nueva has truly become the vital, vibrant heart of the city once again.","Narrative Replacement Therapy for La Placita Nueva will benefit Los Angeles by restoring its historic core, both physically and emotionally.  Building off renewed interest in Downtown LA, Grand Park, and the growing transit system based at Union Station, the onekilometer circle that is the subject area will unite everything from the LA River up to the Music Center, from Little Tokyo to Chinatown through a comprehensive masterplan to draw tourists, new residents, and new economies to the vibrant heart of the city.","Success of La Placita Nueva in 2050 would be to have the story of Los Angeles legible in architecture and infrastructure, familiar to everyone and embraced by all â€“ a new narrative in place having arisen directly from its context; a new economy firmly established; and La Placita Nueva restored as the heart of Los Angeles for all Angelenos."
3102266,2013266,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/reclaimedpark.html,Reclaimed Park Strand Project, Environmental Quality,"Access to parks is a major fallback for many neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Statistics from â€œTrust for Public Landâ€, No Space To Play, 2004 show that many of the areas with the highest children populations also have the least park access. The problem is not the lack of land, but the poor use of it. After researching old railroad lines in Los Angeles, weâ€™ve stumbled upon strands of unused land left of from old railroad lines. One of these strands is from the Pacific Electric Exposition Line which ran from Santa Monica, to USC, and finally to the Los Angeles River. It was closed down many years ago, and recently the Metro Expo line has been over a portion of it from Culver City to USC, and north to Downtown. However, just east of the 110 Freeway, the remains of the old line carve thought city blocks, often gated off and unused or covered with asphalt to be used as parking. The project will be focus on reclaiming a part of this unused land that runs through two residential blocks and converting it to a green park strand. 





There are copious examples of land that used to serve now obsolete infrastructure being reused as public open space. One example is the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt which used to be another branch of the Pacific Electric Railroad, but has been converted into a green promenade for bicyclists, joggers, and pedestrians. It connects Marina Del Rey to Hermosa Beach. The vision for 2050 is to create a similar green strand that will connect USC to the LA River, and provide ample green park space to the neighborhoods in between. However, to undertake such a large project it is important to start small and create a catalyst for change. We believe this project can be the catalyst for change because it will address a lack of park access in the neighborhood, and create a foundation for further growth.


We believe the site between Maple Ave and San Pedro St., and 30th St. and 32nd St. is an ideal place for a park because there are only 3 other parks within a mile radius to be used by the children of 7 schools within the same mile radius. The park will not only provide public open space, but it will also serve as a pedestrian promenade between 2 elementary schools 29th Street Elementary and Delores Huerta Elementary. The much needed open space will not only improve the environmental quality of the area, but also provide a pedestrian link between the school for children to use. It will further benefit the low income community because park proximity has a direct correlation to home values. Furthermore, with the parkâ€™s proximity to the schools, is can be used as an extension of the campuses for educational purposes. The park will have areas for relaxation and recreation, as well as a community garden. This garden will be open to the community and can be used by the elementary school for teaching. 





Adjacent to the site is the Crossing at 29th Street Development by UHC LLC (http://www.uhcllc.net/crossingsat29th.php) which is a multiphased project that deals with rezoning the currently industrial properties to be redeveloped as multifamily residential homes and supporting facilities. The master plan for UHC project also features a green promenade on the land which was used as railroad infrastructure. This project will directly link to the green space and provide an extension for the green pedestrian promenade. Looking toward 2050, the goal is to keep reclaiming the unused parcels of land and extend the promenade for pedestrians, joggers, and bicyclists to connect to USC and Exposition Park on the west, and the Los Angeles River in the East.





Please see our video presentation for a graphic explanation of the project.


","The foundation is a collaboration of two urban visionaries â€“ Xander Tertychny and Eric Solis, who have both graduated from USC with a degree in Architecture. Xander has been involved with organizations such as Global Architecture Brigades and helped design and fundraise for projects benefiting underprivileged communities in Central America. He currently works for June Street Architecture. Eric currently works at HNTB and is part of the new 6th Street Viaduct project team, working with city officials and community leaders on creating successful urban public spaces for the Los Angeles community.","We plan of working with the community leaders and the city representatives heavily at the start of the project in order to attain the land and maximize its use. We also plan on working with the schools to get feedback for creating the best environment and programs for children, utilizing the newly reclaimed park space. We are also very eager to work and consult with UHC LLC about how to most beneficently connect the green public spaces to reinvigorate the neighborhood. Finally, we are excited to use our professional resources to collaborate with the community to create a space everyone can enjoy. ","The project will be evaluation will be reflection of the impact on the community. We are eager to see of the new public green space being used by the local residents and schools. The best result would be full community and school engagement in the space, as well as creation of new educational or extracurricular programs using the space. The more people use the space, the better we feel out putting our energy in creating it. We believe we can provide a foundation for the community to perpetuate our efforts. An example of this is creating the community garden â€“ given the land, planters, soil, and seeds/plants for the garden; we will measure success by how much the community upkeeps and uses it. As the project grows, we will evaluate success in connecting to neighboring blocks and creating green public spaces from the currently unused lots. Our vision of success by 2050 is to connect a linear green promenade to USC and the LA River. ","On an immediate timeline, the project will benefit the local residents by providing a public park space and a community garden. It will benefit 29th Street Elementary and Delores Huerta Elementary by provide a campus extension for the children to play, as well as create a pedestrian connection between the two. The initial benefits reflect mostly on improving environmental quality, but as the project grows, we are looking to also create a new strand for Connectivity for Angelenos. By 2050, we intend to create a pleasant rout for bicyclists and joggers from USC to the LA River, as well as children returning home from their respective schools to their home somewhere in between the two destination points.  ","If we can get on our bikes and take and trek through an urban park from USC to the Los Angeles River, the project is a success.  If there is more green space for children to play, we would consider the project a success. If the local communities have a place to gather, relax, and collaborate, the project is a success. If schools are linked by a green strip of parkland that children can use to get home rather than walking by industrial warehouses, the project is a success. If all these are true in 2050, the project has been executed in the way we envision it. "
3102267,2013267,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/URBANTxt.html,South LA + HackerSpace = Innovative youth community united to learn technology skills together, Education,"Imagine what life could be like if a teen in South Los Angeles could see more computers than liquor stores while walking home from school. Imagine if South LA did not have the highest unemployment rate in the city but instead produced the highest number of tech pioneers in the country. URBAN Teens eXploring Technology (URBAN TxT), a local nonprofit with a citywide focus, seeks to accomplish that by building a technology innovation center in one of the most underinvested areas in the city. 





URBAN TxT will build a â€œhacker spaceâ€   a space with technology equipment and an opendoor policy for everyone who wants to express creativity, address social issues through computer programing, and innovate through collaboration. URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space will also be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) by providing wireless connectivity so that those with computers, tablets or phones can come in to work on individual or team projects. At this space you will find individuals with different levels of technology experience who will help each other master 21st century skills.   





In an area of the city where teens will come across more prostitutes than parks, a community space that unites technology and innovative thinking will transform the landscape of how the community interacts within itself and with the city. URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space is the next logical step for a program that has used computer programming and web development over the past three years to set inner city youth on a path of leadership and STEM careers. 





More importantly, the hacker space will be a sanctuary for the next generation of leaders so that they can learn the skills needed to fulfill todayâ€™s job opportunities and to excel in the jobs of tomorrow. URBAN TxTâ€™s vision for a hacker space is bigger than a community center that uses technology to bring everyone together for an innovative and better future. It will prepare students for college and beyond, while empowering those not in school and educating parents so everyone can succeed in the working world. 





Investing in a South LA technology innovation center, or hacker space, means investing where weâ€™ll see the biggest impact. The population of South LA is hungry for success and opportunity because life there does not offer an easy path. The area sees more than half of its students drop out of school. With 32% of African Americans unemployed and Latinos not far behind,  itâ€™s imperative we do something to shift trends and prevent further damage. 





URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space will empower a population that has a drive to succeed which has not yet been nurtured. Although the direct investment is localized to South LA, the benefits go past the city of LA. The space will be available to everyone who wants to use technology and creativity in a positive manner. Better yet, because technology breaks down physical barriers, a part of the city that currently has an abysmal 30% of homes with internet access could be connected to all parts of the world. 





URBAN TxT's hacker space will also provide a community space for schools, churches, nonprofit organizations and others that need to add tech to their curriculums. The space will serve as a venue for community events, like the South LA HackAThon which already happened once in February and will happen again on April 13th, 2013, to further bring the community together. 





Education will be heavily impacted through URBAN TxT's hacker space. The initiative will increase attendance rates of inner city youth to 4year universities, engage students in the educational process through a recreational outlet with professional benefits, and will increase scholarship opportunities by providing students with valuable skills and experience. 





URBAN TxT's hacker space will further impact education by uniting diverse and specialized skill sets thanks to and through partnerships. The space will allow for workshops on new programming languages, forums with founders of tech startups and team building activities using different educational techniques. 





The impact on the indicator can be predicted because URBAN TxT is already seeing these results. 100% of graduating seniors that go through URBAN TxT have gone on to 4year universities, all students come out of the program with advanced tech knowledge, founders and executive from small and large tech companies are already involved, students have higher aspirations and confidence levels, and the program continuously explores learning methods that create accountability between students while producing better results.





The group started out meeting at a local coffee shop already released its first product built by students, YouPolitic.me. Students built the online platform in the summer of 2012 as a way to engage high school students in the political process. The site runs mock elections, aggregates data and allows for easy sharing. URBAN TxT represents the future of education and business, with responsibility first and enterprise second. ","Over the past three years URBAN Teens eXploring Technology has experienced many achievements: 


 70% of the students in the program go on to computer engineering degrees. 


100% of the students graduate high school and 


 90% go on to a fouryear university. 


 Program has a 100% retention rate 


 60% students have made an upswing in academic performance while top performers maintain high grades


 25% of program alumni come back during the summer to mentor and serve as project manager of the teens


 75% increase in understanding the power of technology to change communities


 The video entry for this wonderful grant was created, directed, produced and edited by URBAN TxT members and alumni


 


One of URBAN TxT's biggest achievements happened during the summer of 2012, when a 5member student team launched YouPolitic.me. The students created a webbased platform which engages youth in the political discussion and educates them on candidates' platforms by creating mock elections. The site has now been live for close to 9 months and continues to grow.

 80% of students participating in summer programs will master web develop by creating a web port


 Increase awareness of STEM careers and majors by 100% percent


 Improve collaboration skills by 70%


 Increase students knowledge of HTML by 60%


 Increase confidence and leadership by 50%","URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space will benefit Los Angeles by creating an innovation hub in one of the areas with the highest number of youths and the lowest number of educational opportunities. The open access to technology and educational resources will keep kids off the street while arming them with the skills they actually need to not just survive, but excel in life. An innovation center that doubles as a technological sanctuary will make our younger generations more appealing to future employees, prepare them to be the best professionals in LA, and more importantly, give them the business and technology skills so that they can start their own ventures. 





Detention rooms in our South Los Angeles high schools are filled with African American and Latino males. High incarceration and dropout rates plague male students in South Los Angeles as on average 54% of them will not graduate high school. Those who graduate school are often times unprepared to enter the workforce. This creates a growing skills gap for STEM positions in which demand outweighs the supply of a skilled workforce, especially in South LA. URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space tackles the root issues and turns what is now a weakness into a strength. The hacker space is part of a larger vision that will turn LA into the breeding ground for the next wave of innovators and visionaries of the world.





By giving a person of any age, background, ethnicity or religion the skills to innovate and a safe place to do so, we unleash vast amounts of untapped potential that would have otherwise been wasted. URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space will be the catalyst that will turn a poverty stricken, gang infested and crime riddled area into a case study for what could be if the right people assets and capital were in place. The hacker space will spark a movement towards more collaboration in learning, innovative use of resources and spaces to drive new ideas and a dedication to education and personal growth unlike anything the city has seen before. 





A technology driven community space like URBAN TxTâ€™s hacker space will open up a world of opportunities to all members of the community. This space will encourage everyone to innovate, use its resources to find job opportunities and online educational programs and to discover what the world has to offer through technology. The hacker space will spark more than just our youths, it will spark unity and forward thinking within an area that continues to fall behind the rest of the city and the country. Community members will be encouraged to take advantage of free online classes through programs like iTunes U while connecting with people all over the world with software like Skype of Google+ Hangouts.





The benefits of URBAN TxT's hacker space go well past South LA. The organization will create a team of ambassadors to share knowledge and the vision for technology and education merging together. The team will share findings with the city, while inviting everyone to be a part of it.   ","Educational success in 2050 will look like an evolved, transformed and improved version of what education in Los Angeles is today. Through URBAN TxT's project Los Angeles will be exposed to a world of opportunities that will shift current trends towards a positive direction and will engage many and most members of society in education. 





Our vision for education in 2050 aims to become a model of how projectbase learning can be use to engage students in computer programming through collaboration. 





If a center like URBAN TxT's hacker space works in South LA to engage what is currently one of the most disengaged communities, then it can work anywhere. Over the past years URBAN TxT has already proved that the model works and the organization has not had a dedicated innovation space. With an assigned space in the area that needs it most the benefits will grow exponentially. 





This space will be a hub that will inspire the city to think different about how technology and education can transform a community.  It will inspire collaborative creative thinking and will provide a place where learning will be looked at as a ""cool"" thing to do, which is the first step to transforming a broken educational system.





At our space people will become ambassadors of innovative thinking. The skills they learn will be used to go teach others at schools through out Los Angeles . Los Angeles needs to be inspire in order to thrive , by inspiring South LA we can inspire all of LA to become a city of innovators. 





South LA in 2050 will be a thriving community that's known for thinking differently and creatively. In 2050 teens will be part of a innovative culture that empowers them to be pioneers and visionaries through technology and community working together.





In 2050 education will be a communitybased activity that connects individuals with the outside world, showing them the vast amount of opportunities available. Education will be the biggest asset a person can have, and it will be easily accessible thanks to technology and collaboration. 





Through URBAN TxT's hacker space education will become the fabric of our community and city, and not a topic of division, arguments and contempt. "
3102268,2013268,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/ValhalLA.html,SelfSustainable Artistic Community , Housing,"A selfsustainable habitat for and run by young artists. Inhabitants live in an Earthship/Superadobe hybrid. Both the Earthship and Superadobe structure are 100% offthegrid. Its design allows it to produce its own food, renewable energy, and water. It heats and cools itself. Bills become extinct. Participants gain complete freedom from the stressors of modern society. Artistic passions are pursued without dependence on a capitalistic structure. Members may act on their dreams at a much younger age than is custom. This serves as a sister community to Valhalla Montreal, which was pioneered last spring.


<p>


The pillar of ValhalLA's success is hinged upon community. Collaboration is highly encouraged. Individuals possess positivity and an openmind. They demonstrate true compassion and commit to live in harmony. Their energy is channeled into their environment's love, abundance, growth, and advancement. They support one another in the creation of progressive and innovative work. An application process is necessaryValhalla Montreal has implemented multiple interviews and tasks to test the talent of potential members.


<p>


Members use their sustainable safehaven to encourage victims of abuse or troubled backgrounds along the correct path. They provide a program that accepts these individuals and allows them to acquire sustainable skills. Knowledge of healthy nutrition, critical thinking, earth building, and permaculture principles are gained through assistance growing food on the base property and empty city lots. This education helps prepare them to enter the workforce and enforces positive social connectivity. Â 


<p>


It is time to challenge that which we've been accustomed. This community serves as an ulterior model. It unites and strengthens each indicator to provide a harmonious option for the future of LA.","ValhaLA being founded. The establishment of partnerships within a short time frame; solidifying a heavy interest in making this idea a reality. The formation of a concrete plan that would allow it to move forward.


<br>


Valhalla Montreal formed in the summer of 2012. The website was then launched and members spread awareness to garner support. They will begin building on their 60 acres of land this spring. They raised $10,000 in less than a week through Kickstarter for the first offthegrid, affordable, lowmaintenance greenhouse.


<br>


Valhalla Washington has also started taking its first steps toward spreading awareness so that it may also sprout into a sister site.","Valhalla Montreal, CalEarth, Gaia Earth and Technologies, Uncommon Good, Earthship Biotecture, Ethos Art Gallery


<p>


ValhalLA is a seed that will spread into a forest. Awareness is the water which allows growth. Partners and collaborators will flourish as word spreads and it becomes more established.","Success cannot be measured in absolute terms. It is measured by progress. Each step advances ValhalLA further on the path to success. Awareness, website, acquisition of land, initiation of the building process, member movein, happiness and health index of inhabitants are a few limbs of the everevolving tree.","According to the LA 2050 report, workers aged 25 and below have the highest unemployment rate of any labor force group. The experience of unemployment is one of the strongest negative impacts on subjective wellbeing. Once unemployed or working an entrylevel position, it is a struggle to afford housing in a healthy environment. Health is compromised as affordable homes are only available in neighborhoods with heavily polluted air that may cause cancer. Time is spent working to afford the cost of living. More than half spend 30% or more to afford housing. They become disconnected from the community. The fundamental nature of human social bonds is a crucial determinant of wellbeing. Neighborhoods with perceived social disorder and a lack of collective efficacy are more associated with crime related outcomes. Â 


Individuals become polarized and trapped in this cycle. They gather to live in an area but are disjointed from one another. They lack the education and skills to create a positive change for themselves.


<br>


ValhalLA benefits Los Angeles by creating a different cycle.


<br>


Houses are affordable. Earthships and Superadobe are created from recyclable materials. They have been tested, proven, and permitted in LA county. While both Earthship and Superadobe designs are revolutionary, they have not yet been integrated. This insemination promotes the recurring theme of innovation and collaboration. It involves experts in both fields and offers a long term solution to the increasing need for housing. Low material and operational costs allow homes to start at $7,000.


<br>


The habitat utilizes permaculture principles. Its structure has zero carbon footprint qualities and zero emission. This has immediate and large scale effects on environmental quality.


<br>


People are healthier with an improved environment and organic, locally grown food.


<br>


According to LA 2050, the current cost of living and unemployment rate place the future vitality of arts and culture at risk. Public arts expenditures are below the national average. There is a lack of artsnurturing policy. ValhalLA members work together to give back to the city. They produce progressive art and maintain a beautiful environment. This heightens social connectivity, which, in turn, promotes public safety. Those who feel they can work with friends, family, and neighbors to bring about positive, collective change are more likely to report feeling safer.


<br>


ValhalLA educates others with knowledge that prepares them to change their own direct community. Others learn selfsustainable skills that enable them to seek and find employment in an emerging market with increasing demand for sustainable, low cost small business and residential buildings.


<br>


ValhalLA introduces an innovative concept; the functioning base for all ideas that have changed the world.","Success in the year 2050 is measured by growth.


<br>


We will consider it an enormous success if we double the number of lives we impact each year.


<br>


We will have started and made a biotectural movement mainstream success by 2050. This will be one of the most influential factors in defining the face of a new community of evolved Los Angelenos. This metropolis will set an example of what can be accomplished when we work together with one another and with our environment. Urban agriculture, like community gardens, will have a place in everyday life. Artists will demonstrate an innovative approach to education and showcase compassionate involvement. Citydwellers will strive to brainstorm new ways to shape LA into an even more desirable place to live. This will not be a city free from problems, but it will be a city equipped with sustainable and communitybased solutions.

3102269,2013269,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/Artistmovement.html,Art Revitalization Movement,Arts & Cultural Vitality,"The Northeast San Fernando Valley has been going through a transformative process of Arts and Culture in the past couple of years, there have been a dozen new murals added to Pacoimaâ€™sâ€™ walls. This has been possible due to the hard work and dedication of community muralists from the Northeast San Fernando Valley.  A Summer Arts Festival at Project Youth Green would expose youth and organizations to the importance of arts and culture for community revitalization. Art centered youth programs in the area do not have the capacity to serve the large Latino youth demographic. 





Project Youth Green, a four acre community garden has been expanding since it first opened and has been home to a practice ground for local artists and youth groups in the community. Artists of all backgrounds and experience levels have participated in painting a canvased gate, adding a wide range of styles, techniques and visuals to the landscape. Currently, this wall is falling apart, the material it is painted on is not meant for painting, and after more than 20 layers of murals in the past 4 years this piece of tarp is deteriorating. 





One idea is to recanvas this wall with a more sustainable material, as well as add more canvas to existing walls. Then with an art competition, invite youth to participate in covering the empty space with new art. Each youth group would be mentored by a practicing artist from the Northeast San Fernando Valley. In order to assure that the next generation has the skills required to continue and expand on this art revitalization, we must expose and train young people to master the brush.





Another aspect to art and design would be to challenge local youth art groups to design four sculptures. These sculptures would be strategically placed considering the landâ€™s terrain in order to create a water harvesting system that would help the garden become selfsustaining. 





With the added blank canvas at the community garden youth are given the opportunity to learn and practice mural skills by providing a space where they can work on largescale projects. A group of artists who are part of this movement will hold workshops, sharing their skills with youth at centers, schools, and organizations. The skills of design, collaboration, and sustainability can be taught simultaneously through art and gardening.





A contest would then be held, opening it up to the youth in the community, where a select number will be chosen to compete at a summer arts festival. Each artist will have a mentor to guide them through the contest. There will be criteria to follow that will challenge their creative thinking and design skills. A winner will be chosen by a panel of judges and the winner will be given the opportunity to add their own mural to Pacoimaâ€™s Mural Mile. All other contestants will be given prizes and the opportunity to help the winner design and execute their mural. 


","Mural Mile has become a necessary project for artists, community members, and art enthusiasts. There have been a dozen new murals added to Van Nuys Blvd. in Pacoima, all in the past 2 years. This has been a grassroots effort, propelled forward by a core group of public artists who collaborate with local nonprofits, but who can also lead a selffunded project with the community. The Pacoima Art Movement has restored pride in the community. ","We plan to actively partner with like minded nonprofits, businesses and individuals in Los Angeles, focusing in our communities in the Northeast San Fernando Valley. Some organizations that would play a more active role are: El Nido Family Centers, Project Youth Green, El Hormiguero, Tia Chuchas, Pacoima Family Source Center, GRYD, Friends of the Family, Youth Speak Collective, Pacoima Chamber of Commerce. Schools: San Fernando High School, Maclay Middle School and Discovery Prep Charter School. Businesses: Myke's Cafe, Stylesville Barbershop, Flores Upholstery. ","Evaluating the project would require identifying the number of free arts workshops available in the Northeast valley in comparison to other parts of Los Angeles. Also, keeping track of the number of youth involved in arts programs at the beginning the year, in comparison to the end of the year. Furthermore, keeping track of how many organizations would be interested in starting a program at their facilities by the end of the year. The number of artist jobs available versus the number of jobs it will create. ","The Northeast San Fernando Valley Art Revitalization Movement will benefit Los Angeles by establishing artistic, cultural and sustainable art projects in a historically neglected part of Los Angeles. The North East San Fernando Valley has the second largest concentration of Latinos in Los Angeles, rivaling East Los Angeles. The community is economically, culturally and racially diverse. Furthermore, the majority of the residents are working class, firstgeneration MexicanAmerican or recent immigrants.





Creating a viable and longlasting Art Revitalization movement in the area will expand and maintain Los Angeles as an international art and cultural center. Currently, the Northeast San Fernando Valley in general, and Pacoima in particular are experiencing an â€œArt Renaissanceâ€, spearheaded by local muralists and community members. In the past two years Van Nuys Blvd, between Arleta Ave and Glenoaks Blvd has been dubbed Mural Mile, in reference to the dozens of worldclass murals that have been designed.





The most notable murals have been designed and painted collaboratively with the local community by Kristy Sandoval and Levi Ponce. Pacoima Art Revolution, which is a reinterpretation of the Mona Lisa and Freedom Fighter which pays homage to Assata Shakur are two examples of mural projects that have inspired and propelled other art projects in the area. Freedom Fighter, designed by Kristy Sandoval and painted entirely by local women artists and aspiring artists defiantly repositions a â€œWomyns place in the struggle,â€ for equality. The mural challenges patriarchal gender roles and stands in stark contrast to the billboards and other media in the area that sexualize the female form. 





Los Angeles once was considered the mural capital of the world. The Northeast San Fernando Valley has organically taken over the mantle with great enthusiasm. However, all of these projects have been grassroots funded or paid out of pocket by the artists. With art programs cut in public schools, young people rely on communitybased art projects to express themselves. These murals project have not only beautified the city, but also have transformed how community members see themselves. In order to create a sustainable art movement in the community and impact greater Los Angeles, more art programs, murals, and public art projects need to be supported in the area. The burgeoning art movement in the North East San Fernando Valley is slowly gaining momentum, but with the right type of support it can have a great impact on future generations of Angelenos.


","In 2050 success will be a continuing art movement, not just in the Northeast Valley, but expanded into the entire Los Angeles area. Art is proven to have positive impacts on communities, and in an area where crime rate is high, graduation rate is low, and the access to arts & culture programs are lacking, a successful outcome can include economic growth by attracting sustainable business into the area, increased graduation rates, and creating pride of ownership in the community."
3102270,2013270,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/vacrainbarrels.html,Beautiful Rain Barrels in Public Places, Environmental Quality,"Weâ€™re trying to improve water quality and conserve water through the spread of rain barrels. Our rain barrels (30 of them) are going to be special because our local artists are going to make them beautiful. Then, weâ€™re going to auction them off at a media event and install them throughout the City in an effort to raise awareness of their use. ","The Venice Art Crawl has been around for more than two years now and has focused a lot of the artistic energy which Venice has historically been known for. For one night, weâ€™re able to turn so many shops and restaurants all across one of the biggest tourist attractions in Los Angles into an arts mecca. That has raised business in local shops by as much as 50% nightly, resulted in thousands of dollars in sales for local artists and reinvigorated the arts community. 





Alternatively, SGA has worked a lot with rain barrels, designing and implementing the first and only rain barrel program of its kind through Mar Vista. There, they promoted and installed 600 rain barrels in the neighborhood, resulting in 33,000 gallons of water conserved every rainfall.",Our biggest partner is SGA who are rain barrel experts and work with PR and environmental matters in LA,"Our biggest metric of success would be developing this into an ongoing program, like if we turned this funding into seed money basically. If we did that, then that would mean that we would be able to keep on creating and distributing eye catching rain barrels which would continue the conversation.





In terms of the rain barrels themselves, we would like to design, promote, auction off and install 30 rain barrels. If we received 12 inches of rain (20% below the LA average of 15 inches annually) then that would fill up 36000 gallons annually. While the weather is out of our control, we think that 36000 gallons conserved is a good goal.


","It benefits LA in lots of ways! First, itâ€™s a creative way to promote the concept and use of rain barrels, which would be very beneficial if used by every in the dry, urban area of LA. Second, 30 rain barrels get out there which adds up to more than 1500 gallons of water conservation (and protection) every time it rains. Third, because of the way we designed the auctions, if we can raise sufficient funds then this project becomes sustainable and can go on until the end of time (or at least a good couple years:)","Success in 2050 is easy to picture: itâ€™s at least one functioning rain barrel for every home in the Cityâ€¦and a few extra for big buildings.





One of the things that is so cool about rain barrels is that they are a simple, practical solution to two major issues (particularly major in a dry, urban sprawl like LA) Combining that with the artistic and community angle we're approaching it with, we think that success in 2050 is easily envisioned."
3102271,2013271,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/beverynice.html,Helping Small Businesses and Independent Contractors in Los Angeles Be Very Nice., Social Connectedness,"When you are making a billion dollars a year, it is easy to donate a million to a good cause. When you are a small business, or an independent contractor, likely bringing in a revenue that is barely pushing 6 figures, it is really hard to give back. Weâ€™ve seen lots of success from models over the years such as the One Laptop per Child initiative, and the famous One for One model from TOMS that proceeded it, but what about the service business? What model of business can be created to turn philanthropy into an integral and viable component of serviceoriented business? We hear about billionaires like Bill Gates giving away half of their networth upon death, but is that kind of impact really limited to the megarich? What would a very nice business look like? 5 years ago I founded a company called verynice to begin to answer these questions.





verynice is a full service design and innovation consultancy that is dedicated to disrupting the way the design industry operates. Over 50% of our efforts are given away for free to nonprofit organizations around the world. I chose to settle on the â€œover 50%â€ philanthropy model because it is my philosophy that anything you spend less than 50% of your time doing is just an extracurricular activity. To have a true impact, I believe we need to make giving back an integral component (at least 50%) of our daily lives. Over the course of 5 years, we have had the pleasure of donating our services to over 200 nonprofit organizations, all adding up to a probono dollar amount of close to $750,000. By the beginning of 2014, if all goes according to plan, we will have hit the million dollar mark in donated services. All of this with a staff of 7 people in our downtown LA office, and over 170 people located around the world.





A recent article in Harvard Business Review estimates that the annual marketing and design expenditure amongst nonprofit organizations in the United States alone is a whopping 7.6 Billion dollars. Letâ€™s put that into perspective. $7.6 Billion dollars can but up to 100,000 homes in the United States. $7.6 Billion dollars can provide over 1 Million college educations. For about a dollar a day, World Vision estimates that a child in an impoverished community can be granted access to fresh water, nutritious food, healthcare, and even an education. Imagine, then, what could be accomplished with the spare funding that would result from the eradication of marketing and design expenditures amongst nonprofit organizationsâ€¦





So here is the thing. Myself and the people at verynice have been able to donate the equivalent of $750k. That is amazing, and I have seen the impact that saved money has had on these organizations, but at the end of the day, it took us 5 years to accomplish that. Here is the other harsh reality check  $750k is only .01% of the amount of money nonprofits are spending each and every year. That is just not enough. We canâ€™t do this alone anymore. If we truly want to create a world in which any and all marketing and design expenditures belonging to nonprofit organizations are eliminated, we need to get serious about the replication of our model.





My vision for verynice has never been to build a big successful business. Instead, the vision has always been to build a big and successful model that is capable of replicating itself by inspiring others to leverage it as their own. To do this, I am launching a new project, beverynice, which is a platform for inspiring and holding accountable independent contractors and small business owners for their philanthropy by offering resources and tools to make â€œextreme philanthropyâ€ a viable endeavor in the small business arena. All of that is getting a bit ahead of myself, but to start this longterm journey, I am creating a â€œbeverynice startupkitâ€ that will completely opensource the verynice business model for other entrepreneurs in serviceoriented business at large (consultants, doctors, designers, lawyers, hairstylists, etc.) to leverage. If all goes according to plan, this startupkit will pave the way for a successful replication of our model. There is no company in the world that comes close to matching our probono ration while still maintaining profitability. I sincerely hope that this project creates more competition for us.





To get started, I already have assembled a team of 14 entrepreneurs / beverynice â€œalpha testersâ€ from around the world that have expressed specific interest in leveraging veryniceâ€™s business model in their own companies, and I am mentoring them all free of charge to make that happen. I have a lot of longterm plans for this project, but in the interest of beging specific for this application, the projectâ€™s scope will include the completion, production, distribution, and dissemination of my toolkit, to make Los Angeles a leader in small business philanthropy.","verynice started in my apartment at UCLA when I was 19 years old. To date, I have grown the organization to be home to over 170 people around the globe. We have successfully completed projects for over 200 nonprofit organizations. Our work has been done in, with, and for 40 countries spanning 6 continents. If you have a project that we can collaborate with you on in Antarctica, please let me know.





All of our work equates to roughly 50,000 hours of volunteer service. This is the equivalent of working for 5.7 years straight without any break, and we do all of this without any automated process or crowdsourced gimmick. Just a group of friends from around the world working hard.





The verynice business model has been featured and published multiple times on renowned publications including Forbes, GOOD Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The Guardian. In total, our work has been featured on over 100 print and online venues.





Over the past 3 years, I have personally delivered over 50 talks / panel discussions / workshops at venues across the United States including TEDx, UCLA, Art Center, and the Art Directors Club.","I will employ verynice, and the freelancers in verynice's network (including myself) for the design and development of all components of this project. The money earned by verynice will not only compensate us for our time away from client work, it will go directly back to the community and the causes we serve by supporting out probono efforts.





Printing partner  I am still seeking out a local printing partner for the toolkit, but would like to work with Typecraft as their work is wonderful.





Workshop partner  While it is not finalized, it makes perfect sense for the workshopping and focus groups to take place in our space at the HUB in the downtown LA Arts District.",I will measure the success of this project purely by numbers. How many people received the toolkit? How many people are actively implementing the toolkit? How many small business in Los Angeles witnessed business transformation? What total dollar amount has been donated to organizations by users of this toolkit? I like numbers. I am not at all a fan of qualitative analysis when it comes to philanthropy and â€œsocial good.â€ the success (or failure) of this project will be documented with great intention and hypertransparency.,"My project will benefit Los Angeles in numerous ways. First, the toolkit will serve as a great resource for entrepreneurs in Los Angeles by giving them the tools and confidence necessary to excel in business and in philanthropy (at the same time). Second, the toolkit will plant the seed for potentially thousands of new businesses in LA, all of which will be actively giving back to their respective communities and the world at large. It is a winwin for Los Angeles and the world in which it resides as well as the people and businesses within LA. 





If this grant is received, I will personally provide up to 5 hours of free consultation on best practices for integrating our model to the first 100 Angelenos that obtain a copy. That is 500 hours of service that I am willing to give to the people of LA, a value of $100,000.00 which is the exact dollar amount of this grant. It all comes back around :)","Success in 2050 for this project would mean that all of veryniceâ€™s altruism, and our model in general, are just common practice. In 2050, the verynice model would be ubiquitous in the Los Angeles business scene. I really hope that we look a lot less impressive by then."

This â€œpipeline to collegeâ€ program would begin working with students in middle school and provide close mentorship through high school and college. </p>





<p>Walking Shield staff and volunteers would help American Indian students achieve academic success and prepare them for college by providing an array of services. Students would receive tutoring, financial aid as well as consultation on college admission procedures, college tours, time management skills, good study habits and other forms of close mentoring to keep them on track to earn their college degree. Walking Shield will also maintain relationships with the studentsâ€™ parents to help them understand, appreciate and support a college education for their children. The $100,000 grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation, LA2050 will excel the efforts of the LA American Indian College Education Initiative and provide a strong base for American Indian students in Los Angeles to prepare and succeed in college.</p>





<p>The LA American Indian College Education Initiative complies with Walking Shieldâ€™s mission to improve the quality of life for American Indian families by coordinating programs that provide educational assistance, humanitarian aid, healthcare, shelter and community development. Walking Shield, established in 1986, has helped American Indian students around the country realize their dream of obtaining a college education and bettering their lives, families and communities. </p>





<p>The need for the LA American Indian College Education Initiative addresses a significant challenge. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the college graduation rate of American Indians is 38 percent. This rate is 17 percent lower than the national average and significantly lower than other ethnic groups. </p>


","<p>In 2012, Walking Shield provided more than $200,000 in college scholarships to 86 students attending colleges and universities mainly in California. The goal for 2013 is to award more than $300,000. This year, an amount of at least $55,000 has been specifically designated for American Indian students living in Los Angeles. This amount can increase based on the number of students in Los Angeles eligible for our scholarships.</p>





<p>Besides helping students earn their bachelorâ€™s degrees, graduate students working on their masterâ€™s and doctorate degrees also receive support. </p>





<p>An emergency fund has been provided by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians to assist these students in covering the costs of tuition rate increases, parking fees, books and tutoring. The goal is to elevate the heavy financial burden of higher education in order to allow students to fulfill their dreams of receiving a college degree. These services are making a difference in improving college graduation rates among the American Indian community in California and around the country. </p>


","Our partners include the College Access Foundation of California, Los Angeles Unified School District, Southern California Edison, California Community Foundation (LA County), the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, United American Indian Involvement (UAII),Teaching, Tribal TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and the Mentoring Indian Tarahat (TAMIT)","Walking Shield will routinely survey students to monitor and record overall retention rates and academic performance. Indicators such as GPA, attendance and extra curricular activities will be closely tracked through ongoing engagements with the students and their families. Data on college preparation, enrollment retention and graduation rates among American Indian students will be the major factor in measuring the success of the program. ","According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2008, 155,010 American Indians live in Los Angeles. Los Angeles led all of the nation's counties in the number of people of this racial category. The LA American Indian College Education Initiative will help American Indian students achieve academic success middle school through college for the purpose of becoming successful and positive community roles models in Los Angeles. ","There would be a new generation of optimistic American Indians working in schools, businesses, schools, universities and civic organizations as leaders, mentors, teachers and professors. They will represent their heritage and culture with pride as they move forward contributing to the exciting innovations of a vibrant 2050."
3102273,2013273,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/wayfinderla.html,Wayfinder LA a utility for carfree transit, Environmental Quality,"Our idea is a mapping and navigation tool designed for carfree transportation in Los Angeles. It will use road quality, public transit, and crowdsourced geolocation data to suggest routes of travel using the three main alternatives to car travel: walking, biking, and public transit.





Walking, biking, and public transit are superior to car travel because they pollute little, alleviate traffic congestion and infrastructure decay, promote health through exercise, and grant mobility to a very broad segment of the population. Yet, 80% of commuters travel by car in Los Angeles because they feel the public transportation system is inadequate and slow and the prospect of alternative transportation is intimidating or too complicated to undertake. Our goal is to remove those unknowns to make alternative modes transportation more accessible to people than it is now. 





Wayfinder relates directly to four LA2050 indicators because it promotes carfree transportation, whose list of benefits is long and diverse. Wayfinderâ€™s indicators are Environmental Quality, Health, Social Connectedness, and Income & Employment. Hereâ€™s why:





Environmental Quality


â€¢	Walking, biking, and public transportation omit drastically fewer polluting gases than cars do, which improves our air quality.


â€¢	Making alternative transportation more accessible to young people gives them better access to parks, which are instrumental to childrenâ€™s wellbeing but are few and far between in Los Angeles. 





Health


â€¢	Walking and biking are physical activities that promote health through exercise. This is especially important for children, who are 10% as likely to become obese if they are physically active than if they are not.





Social Connectedness


â€¢	Pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit riders interact with Los Angeles and the people who live here far more than the driver that enters the freeway time warp and is spit out at the destination. This daily interaction with the community tightens the social web and increases trust and social engagement, which encourage political involvement and volunteerism.





Income & Employment


â€¢	Driving is expensive, and the burden of that expense falls most heavily on the poor. Gas costs can eat up as much as 10% of a low income familyâ€™s earnings, to say nothing of the other costs associated with driving a car. Walking, biking, and public transit are consistently less expensive than driving. 


","Our organization is a new one whose purpose is to pursue the singular goal of making multimodal transport easier and more accessible in Los Angeles. 





The members of our organization have been active in the Los Angeles bike community, particularly through the bicycle coops the Bicycle Kitchen and the Bikerowave. These organizations are nonprofit bicycle workshops and education spaces that provide the space, equipment, and support necessary for people to repair and maintain their bicycles. Our volunteer efforts at the BK and Bikerowave are one way for us boost community support for alternative transportation and make it accessible to more people. It is working with these organizations that it occurred to us just how many more people would change their transportation habits if given the knowledge and community support to feel confident venturing out onto the street. 


","Today, we are a small team with a great idea, and we're still looking for a data analyst, an algorithm designer, and user interface designer to bring our concept to reality. 





Outside of our team, we want to collaborate with as much of the Los Angeles cycling community as possible in making this a useful resource for those who already travel without a car in LA. Weâ€™ll also rely heavily on bike advocacy organizations in Los Angeles to help us promote our resource once itâ€™s built. 





Organizations to collaborate with are the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, CicLAvia, the Bicycle Kitchen Bike Oven, and Bikerowave, the LA Metro, LADOT, Ride South LA, C.I.C.L.E., Culver City Bicycle Coalition, South Bay Bicycle Coalition, Santa Monica Spoke,","In the short term, success is a high level of engagement in our resource. We want this to be such a useful utility that people use it all the time and suggest it to others. To get off the ground, we plan to create a map and navigation utility based on information we already know about the roads and transit systems in Los Angeles, but we think it makes most sense to rely on the collected experience of our users to determine the best ways to get around. As such, we plan for the final version of Wayfinder to use aggregated data gathered from usersâ€™ smartphones as they travel. 


The great thing is that Wayfinder is designed to grow because its effectiveness is tied to its use. The more people use and interact with it, the more it learns, and the more it works. 





In the long term, we dream of a day when the car is no longer considered the only way to travel in LA. We want to help shift the paradigm regarding transportation in Los Angeles and to see this city embrace alternatives to the car to build a healthy, sustainable, efficient transportation system. We want to provide urban planners with useful data to streamline bike and pedestrian infrastructure, bike share programs and public transit into an efficient and userfriendly system. 


","Wayfinder will benefit Los Angeles and its residents in two distinct realms: the social and the structural. Social benefits include to those that directly benefit individuals, like improved air quality, less expensive transportation, and increased physical exercise. The structural benefits are those that result from the coordinated activity of thousands of travelers and enable our urban planners to maximize the efficiency of our transit systems.





Social Benefits


Wayfinderâ€™s benefits are the benefits of sustainable, efficient multimodal transportation. Those we have listed above under the first question and we think theyâ€™re a nobrainer. The more challenging question is this: How do we encourage Angelenos to change their attitudes toward transportation, and how do we get them to adopt more sustainable methods of transit?





The answer: provide Angelenos with the necessary information to make smart, confident choices about transportation. Hereâ€™s an example:





Recently, we were talking to our friend Brian, who lives in Culver City and works on the PCH in Malibu. Brian rides a bike for exercise in recreation, but spends about 90 minutes in the car each day, traveling the 36 miles round trip work and back. In the course of our conversation about his commute, he realized that he could ride his bike 7 miles to the 534 Metro Express stop and ride the bus to work from there. Brian calculated that the trip would take only 15 more minutes each way, and he began to grow excited as he realized that he would be cutting the roughly $40 a week he spends on gas to get to and from work to $15 in bus fare.  By the time he realized that he would now spend half his commute exercising on his bicycle and the other half reading or gazing at the Pacific Ocean, he was ecstatic. 





Brian has changed his routine, and all he needed to do so was a little bit of information and the encouragement. We think there are hundreds of thousands of people in LA who rely on cars when they donâ€™t have to, and we want all of them to have the same epiphany Brian did. When they do, theyâ€™ll live healthier, more sustainable lives, and Los Angeles will be a better place to live.





Structural Benefits


Los Angelesâ€™ public transit infrastructure is chronically underused simply because Angelenos are not aware of how to make the most of it. Brian, for example, had no idea that a bus could get him to work. LA taxpayers have spent millions on public transportation infrastructure over the past few decades, but weâ€™re wasting a lot of that money if we donâ€™t maximize the use of our existing infrastructure. Wayfinder aims to do just that by providing paths to access public transit systems.





Further, by using smartphone geolocation technology to track our userâ€™s trips, we determine which routes are most favorable to multimodal travelers. Suddenly, the best routes are publically available information, and transit streamlines itself along these routes the way tributaries converge to form rivers. With all of the ","We think we can help make noticeable change in the four indicator categories mentioned in question 1. 





Environmental Quality


â€¢	Federal and state emissions regulations have drastically improved air quality in the past 40 years. By 2050, we want to see at least the same amount of improvement thanks further emissions reduction initiatives and alternative transport initiatives


â€¢	We also want to see mobility for low income and young citizens drastically improves so everybody has better access to parks and green spaces. 





Health


â€¢	Success in this indicator is a precipitous drop in obesity rates. Obesity is caused by a number of factors, but weâ€™re excited to do our part by encouraging active lifestyles. 





Social Connectedness


â€¢	Rates of volunteerism and voter turnout rely heavily on citizenâ€™s perceived connectedness to their community. By bringing people out of enclosed cars and freeways and into the city in which they live, we think we can build a city thatâ€™s more engaged and more connected.





Income & Employment


â€¢	For us, success in this indicator category means decreasing the overall cost of transit for low income people so they can direct the money toward more useful pursuits like education, healthcare, and nutrition.

Our project, SLAM GUN VIOLENCE, gives youth an opportunity to express their grief, fear, and isolation through the creative process of slam poetry instead of through more violence.  ","Women Against Gun Violence has been around since 1993 working to prevent gun violence in Los Angeles City and County.  We have done this work through storytelling.  Our Speakers Bureau members, gun violence survivors themselves, share their stories with students throughout Los Angeles Unified School District  so that youth can see the actual tragedy of gun violence.  Our Speakers Bureau members also share their stories  with policymakers to encourage change in our gun regulations.  We were included in Vice President Biden's meetings in January 2013 where our Speakers Bureau format was considered part of a national solution. ","We are hopeful that Nikki Blak, the recipient of the 2005 World Stage/UCLA Literary Scholarship, will be our Artistic Director.  Nikki has been a member of the 2006 Los Angeles, 2007 Hollywood, and 2008 San Diego Slam Teams.

3.  Number of youth involved in program who see improvement in grades and attendance at school


4.  Number of youth in the program who refer others to the program","At risk youth who are survivors of gun violence  either shot themselves or lost someone to gun violence  will be given an opportunity to channel their anger and grief into a medium, Slam Poetry, instead of channeling their anger into more violence.

But writing is important, and creative writing is more important still. The ability to express oneself, in public, professional and private contexts, is critical for success, effective communication and the development of community. </p><p>WriteGirl has more than 12 years of success in guiding young people to express themselves through creative writing and mentoring. The results have been extraordinary and despite the rapid digitization of the globe, reports of writingâ€™s obsolescence are greatly exaggerated! </p><p>The purpose of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project is to leverage the abundant creative writing and educational talent pool of Los Angeles, and to foster the joy of writing. We hope that this project will serve as the pilot program for annual citywide writing events. The project website will remain active yearround, showcasing selected writing and inspiring stories. We want to guide our city to write together, to empower any individual to express his or her stories in creative ways.</p> <p>Everyone has a story to tell. Los Angelenos have rich personal histories and perspectives. The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project emphasizes the communityâ€™s role in education. The project will be kicked off by a weeklong coed program of creative writing workshops in middle schools and high schools throughout Los Angeles. </p><p>Who would lead these workshops? We believe that with the right tools and training, anyone who loves to write can be an effective, powerful mentor. WriteGirl would recruit and train men and women from all walks of life to become Writing Guides during the weeklong Power of the Pen: Writing Together project. </p><p>Simultaneously, the Power of the Pen project would galvanize the city through a series of creative writing activities around the city, so that Angelenos can write and create together, with the carefully scoped guidance that we specialize in (and that helps us get great writing from virtually anyone). The entire community of Los Angeles would be invited to participate by sharing their written stories through a website specifically dedicated to this program. The theme for the kickoff week will focus on writing personal stories about where weâ€™ve been and where weâ€™re going.</p><p>These events can be presented with the many organizations we partner with or who currently support our work, but also in settings that are both new to our traditional work and also new as settings for creative writing. That means outdoors, in the middle of the workday (and workplace), on public transportation, in the chambers of government, at the schools and universities, in the company of people you love and value, and in the company of strangers (or notyetmet friends). We propose to write in the shadow of Los Angeles landmarks to draw inspiration from our unique landscape and culture, to write with the inclusion of the many, many professional writers who congregate to our city and its various mediadriven enterprises, and to connect online with groups and individuals, inviting them to write with us, in real time, to reiterate the value of writing together.</p><p>When people participate in creative writing (which is distinct from schoolbased writing), they often experience transcendence. Gone are the red pencil marks from a teacher who didnâ€™t understand, the feelings of exclusion because a mandate for perfection excluded you from one of humanityâ€™s core activities â€“ expressing our true, uncensored creative instincts â€“ the things we make up entirely on our own, often in a completely unique way. Creative writing is different because it prompts the writer to take risks, to explore ideas that are not yet fully formed or perfected. Creative writing presents a standard to meet that is entirely selfdesigned. It is freeing, fortifying, and prompts people to travel even further along their own journeys of personal development. Creative writing brings what is inside to the outside so you can share it with the world around you and, if need be, create that world for yourself.</p><p>You are what you write. That has been the experience of WriteGirl over the past 12 years. We have guided young writers and adults to produce writing that has thrilled those near enough to hear it read aloud. Our books have been lauded with 48 national and international awards. We have mostly worked with high school girls, but have also very effectively developed events for boys, coed groups, middle schoolers, adults, and youth who are critically at risk, such as those who are pregnant, parenting, or incarcerated. Even the audiences at all of our large events get to connect with the power of the pen â€“ you canâ€™t attend a WriteGirl event without being prompted to write something!<p>


","<p>For eleven consecutive years, WriteGirl has guided 100% of the seniors in our Core Mentoring Program to not only graduate from high school, but enroll in college, often on full or partial scholarships. Many are the first in their families to attend college. How do we do that? There is a direct connection between creative writing and confidence. When you are empowered to believe in the value of your own voice, you can be the architect of your own success.</p><p>WriteGirl has published 12 anthologies that have earned 48 national and international book awards. These books, highly interactive and beautifully designed, contain the work of teen girls and the women writers who mentor them. They are a concrete testament to the power of the pen.</p><p>WriteGirl has hosted hundreds of creative writing events for audiences large and small, in many different settings. We work with girls who participate in our Core Program for up to five years, as well as working with writers we have never met before in onetime only programs. </p><p>We have developed creative writing programs for critically atrisk teens (both boys and girls) who are pregnant/parenting, on suspension, incarcerated or struggling with significant life challenges. We have developed more than 15 books of writing from these young people. We are now providing graduation support and higher education guidance for this group of participants.</p>


In 2002, LAUSD high school student Glenda Garcia joined WriteGirl, not knowing what to expect. During her four years in the program, she attended monthly workshops, worked with several mentors, attended college readiness sessions, read her creative writing at public readings and had her work published in several of WriteGirlâ€™s awardwinning anthologies. In her senior year, WriteGirl nominated her for a Posse Scholarship. She won, and attended Dickinson College on a full ride. Upon college graduation, Glenda was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship. Weâ€™re very excited to say that she is taking a year to work with us at WriteGirl as our Membership Coordinator. Where will Glenda be in 2050? We are confident that she will be a key contributor to the success of any community in which she resides..<p>Here are a few more alumnae success stories:Emily is on her way to Harvard University, where she received a full scholarship.</p><p>Lovely has a summer fellowship in nuclear policy at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and will spend next year researching in China.</p><p>Jamilah, a junior at Dartmouth, spent the last semester doing community outreach work in Los Angeles and will travel to China in the fall to conduct research for her senior thesis.</p>Our success has been recognized:


In 2010, WriteGirl was awarded a Medal of Service and named the California Nonprofit of the Year by the Office of the Governor.


In 2010, WriteGirl received the Humanitas Philanthropy Prize. 


In 2011, WriteGirl was finalist in the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards.","WriteGirl has longstanding partnerships with many organizations who we will approach to help us implement this project. Educational partners include the Los Angeles County Office of Education, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs Youth Arts Division. Prominent civic institutions who have partnered with WriteGirl to host writing workshops and events include: Walt Disney Concert Hall, MOCA, the Los Angeles Times, The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, the Autry Museum, the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Los Angeles Central Public Library, Skylight Books, Book Soup, Vromanâ€™s, the Writers Guild Theater and the GRAMMY Foundation. 


","<p>The success of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project can be measured through the selected writing that will be showcased on the projectâ€™s website. The online conversation will demonstrate how effectively the project connected and inspired people. </p>





<p>We will survey participants and stakeholders about their involvement in the project. Our committee will meet for a wrapup event to evaluate all aspects of the projectâ€™s success. </p>





<p>WriteGirl will complete a detailed report documenting each aspect of the program and its effectiveness. This project will add to the civic dialogue about the necessity for creative education, and the ways that we can bring the city together to participate in that process. </p>





<p>Through the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project we anticipate that many great stories will be shared, in a way that can transform a city.</p>


","The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project will benefit Los Angeles by raising to prominence the value of creative writing and selfempowerment. The joy of sharing our stories can contribute much to the quality of life in Los Angeles. If we want to address the dire high school dropout rate of nearly 50% at many Los Angeles public schools, if we want to shift that number by 2050, we need to plant seeds now that will inspire students to want to write, and engage the community to help make that happen.





In order to implement this project, we would assemble a committee of local teachers, students, parents, arts education professionals, corporate partners and experienced WriteGirl mentors and volunteers. The team would develop the slate of writing events, refine curriculum and establish recruitment and volunteer training criteria for the Power of the Pen Writing Guides. Each committee member would receive a modest stipend to help secure their commitment of time and energy. The committee would be led by a paid project coordinator, who would spearhead communications and project goals. 





The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project would integrate writing, education, arts education and community activism, giving all Los Angeles residents the chance to take part in the educational success of the youth of Los Angeles and connect with the creative energy of their own personal voices.


","<p>The goal of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project for success in 2050 is multifaceted: 1) improve creative writing skills and education outcomes in students, 2) train and inspire an army of Writing Guides and leverage the creative talent in Los Angeles, 3) guide and support teachers to bring out the best creative writing in students, 4) empower the community to be part of the solution, 5) build a lasting archive of personal creative writing from Angelenos, connecting generations, connecting disparate parts of Los Angeles, and connecting our personal histories to our collective future.</p>





<p>In the words of one of our teen writers, â€œOne voice does matter.â€ Success in 2050 depends on success now. </p>





<p>WriteGirlâ€™s success rate compared to the current high school dropout rate, is a direct demonstration of how students can be successful when they are given tools and a safe environment in which to express themselves and their ideas. We want to use the impetus of WriteGirlâ€™s 11 years of success to bring the joy of creative writing into the community and engage the city of Los Angeles in Writing Together to help educate and inspire our youth and ourselves.</p>

3102276,2013276,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/YI_Care.html,Young Leaders For A Healthy LA, Health,"Young Invincibles (YI) is an organization that expands opportunities for young adults between the ages of 18 and 34, with a primary focus on health care. YI creates targeted policy, research, and education campaigns that engage young adults and policymakers, and has become the most prominent national youth voice around young adults and health care, with offices and staff in LA and DC.





Young adults are a key population to target as CA moves toward implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This demographic is disproportionately un and underinsured, and often lacks both health homes and consistent care. YI recognizes the needs of young consumers and the importance of getting â€œyoung invinciblesâ€ informed and insured. New Exchanges also rely on the participation of the younger, healthier population to succeed and bring down costs for everyone.  





For many young people, a cell phone is a critical part of everyday life.  Connecting with friends, finding directions, getting advice  it all happens on a cell phone. While 25% of smartphone users overall use their phone as their primary Internet access point, 42% of young adults, 38% of African Americans, and 40% of Latinos, go online mostly using their cell phones.





In order to reach young adults where they are, YI has developed a free smartphone application, called Health Care Finder â€“ Los Angeles, which easily disseminates health information to young adults in Los Angeles. The application educates users on available health providers, contains FAQâ€™s about the ACA, and gives information about different health insurance options. The app will also include a direct connection to the new California exchange where lowincome youth can get MediCal or subsidies for more affordable coverage, as well as push notification reminders around health services and enrollment. The app is already available on a range of smartphones and is already winning accolades as a true innovation in health care education. 





In a time, and in a city, in which everything is fastpaced and engaging young people can be difficult, this mobile application is a quick onestop shop to obtain all of the information needed to help young adults make informed decisions on obtaining health coverage. The application can also help users identify facilities and providers that have been recommended by others in their communities. Since September 2012, YI has strived to improve the app, obtaining feedback from young adult roundtables around LA to ensure that the app is evolving in the most useful and targeted way for the population we serve. YI also continues to promote the mobile app through community events and asks users to provide feedback. 





However, to truly have an impact in terms of health and coverage for young adults in LA, YI must empower local young people themselves to take a lead role in our education and outreach program. Therefore, YI proposes to develop a base of diverse Young Promoters, ages 18 to 34, that can lead this effort and bring an authentic, trusted voice to their own communities. The Young Promoters will be given training on the ACA, coverage options, and on the use of the mobile app. Promoters will be selected among those that have participated in YIâ€™s ongoing roundtable discussions and have been the most active in providing feedback. The work of these Promoters will result in the following:





1.	Outreach and Education in Los Angeles: Young Promoters will be able to easily attend local community/school events and provide information about the mobile application and the importance of getting covered. 


2.	TraintheTrainer: After receiving the training, Young Promoters will be given the opportunity to develop their own project in which they will be given a goal to reach 1,000 young adults and educate them about the ACA, how they can enroll, and encourage them to download the app. Young Promoters will receive a stipend of $1,000 when they complete their 6 month individual projects. We anticipate having 20 Young Promoters in year one.


3.	Mobile Application Social Media Campaign: Through the base of Young Promoters and the young adults they train and inform, these Promoters will lead a social media campaign in which they will support the use of the free mobile application and will encourage others to continue providing feedback, information on resources that can be included, and most importantly to raise their voice on health care issues in their community.





The goal is to ensure that a greater number of young adults are 1) obtaining health coverage and services and 2) that they are voicing their health care needs. Young leaders are the drivers that our communities need to ensure that everyone gets the care they deserve. As many organizations and groups in California are preparing to begin informing and enrolling the community in Covered California, YI and its Young Promoters can be the informational and educational providers and the voice for this population.","Young Invincibles has had notable successes in its health coverage and access program, establishing itself as the national leader on promoting health care and coverage for young adults. In 2011 and 2012, YI led a coalition of over 50 national and local partners around our â€œGetting Coveredâ€ health care education campaign that provided information to millions of young adults on and offline about how to get covered up to age 26 under the new law. As part of this campaign, YI released and distributed online a health care education toolkit to educate young people on the importance of health coverage, timed around Valentineâ€™s Day, with a reach of over 1.5 million young adults. Already, over 3.1 million uninsured young adults have taken advantage of the dependent coverage provision and gained affordable insurance, far exceeding expectations. In fact, young adults are the only demographic to see uninsurance rates decline during the Recession.





YI has also established expertise on coverage issues for young adults. YI successfully advocated for major improvements to student health plans following the ACA, changes that have helped over 3 million students on college plans see more comprehensive, better coverage. Similarly, YI has worked with the White House and congressional leadership to get national coverage of YI members benefiting from reform, and released the first comprehensive national report and poll on the economic and health challenges facing young adults since the Recession. YI has established itself as the goto media source for information on young adults and health care, appearing in the LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN, among other outlets.





Last March, YI launched our National Youth Bus Tour. YI staff visited 43 cities in 20 different states, including 43 campuses and hosted over 100 youth events and roundtables designed to hear the perspective of diverse young adults on the economic, educational and health challenges they face. At our events, we provided statespecific materials on health care needs of young adults and options for coverage. The tour was covered widely, including this feature in the New York Times. The tour expanded our youth networks across the country, and particularly in California.





In LA, YIâ€™s mobile app won LA Social Innovation Fast Pitchâ€™s grand prize of $15,000. Tamika Butler, California Director, pitched at the competition and described plans to expand mobile app in lowincome LA communities. Our policy expertise and experience with education campaigns will serve as a strong backbone to this project. ","YI works with coalitions in key target areas, including the California Partnership, LA Access to Health Coverage Coalition, Southside Coalition of Community Health Centers, Community Health Council, and the Cal Endowment Building Healthy Communities Outcome Work Group for South LA. We have talked to a wide variety of health care clinics that serve young people and are excited about our mobile app in particular. We have worked with campuses extensively on the ACA, giving educational presentations to students at USC, UCLA, and CSULA; our networks extend to other campuses as well, where we engage in education trainings around financial aid and student loans; those networks will be brought into our health care outreach as well.","YI will use the following metrics to evaluate the overall success and impact of the health care outreach and education campaign: 





â€¢	Number and percentage of YIâ€™s online following in LA receiving and responding to messaging on health coverage and the mobile app;


â€¢	Number of LA organizations who participate in outreach to members who otherwise would not;


â€¢	Number of young Angelinos who participate in YIâ€™s ontheground events, including trainings, forums and campus health fairs;


â€¢	Number of young people who take action. For example, who share their story online about how important it is to be covered; the number of young adults who sign up and download materials; 


â€¢	The number of young Angelinos who ultimately enroll in the exchange and through MediCal.





For the Young Promoters, in particular, we will use the following metrics:





â€¢	Number of young people we have signing up to become Promoters, receive and pass the training, and complete the program.


â€¢	Number of young adults educated by each Promoter, including number (1) trained by a Promoter at events on health coverage and the mobile app, (2) that have downloaded the mobile app as a result, and (3) have been contacted by the Promoter via social media on health care and coverage; and (4) have taken an action via social media to share information or the mobile app with their friends. 


â€¢	Pre/Post tests of youth roundtable and training participants on understanding of health care options in their community. 


â€¢	Oneonone interviews with young people served that will cover successful strategies, challenges that they have faced, as well as general overview of feedback being received. 


â€¢	Reports from community health centers, student health centers and community navigators on increased usage of services as a result of Promoters.","Young adults (1834) continue to go uninsured and without access to basic health care at rates that far exceed the rest of the population. The ACA presents an opportunity to make huge gains for young adults. In CA, there are 3.1 million uninsured young adults, representing 32.8% of all young Californians. Of that 3.1 million, 2.7 million earn under 400% of the federal poverty level and therefore would qualify for either subsidies in the exchange or MediCal. Young adults comprise 42% of the total uninsured population in CA. 





California also has a highly diverse young adult population, many of whom are uninsured.  In fact, about 42% of young Latinos (1834) are uninsured. Enrolling these young adults in new exchanges is not only important for the health and financial wellbeing of this population, but critical for the overall CA insurance market as it spreads risk and can help keep premiums down. These rates are starkest in Los Angeles County where the 39% uninsured rate for young adults surpasses the statewide average of 31%.  Both rates exceed the national average.





We want to change this by decreasing the number of young adults of color in Los Angeles who go uninsured. Young Invincibles will utilize our Young Promoters and health care education mobile app and a push text message campaign to complement a broader social media and communications campaign. Our diverse network of 20 Young Promoters will dramatically expand the reach of YI by hosting local youth trainings in their community or on campus, and by promoting the mobile app and health coverage awareness through social media. The mobile app will provide key information about the ACA, places to find local doctors and community health centers, a portal to Covered California, and have the ability to reach the population repeatedly through push text notifications. Using online social media outreachâ€“ targeted Facebook promotions, contests, engagement with Twitter influencersâ€“ and combining this method with dissemination of our ontheground Young Promoters trainings, we can educate young adults on the ACA, facilitate the download of our mobile app, and ultimately reach thousands of uninsured young people. Once these young people have been trained by their peers and downloaded the app, they can be valuable leaders in their own communities. 





We will also use social media more broadly to build awareness as major changes occur.  During the launch of open enrollment on October 1, 2013 and around special enrollment times like graduation, we will launch highly sharable social media content. For example, we will ask our Young Promoters to post content that contains our enrollment messages to their personal networks and to share a form for friends to get signed up for more information. We will use our own organizational social media platforms, engage with partner social media organizations, and work with social media influencers to push out those messages and drive young adults to the exchange.","In 2050, success in health care would include coverage for everyone that is truly affordable along the entire spectrum of health care. The uninsured rate for 1834 year olds in the United States is 27%. In California that rate is even higher at 31%. On the local level in Los Angeles, the data is even worse. With 39% of young Angelinos currently lacking insurance, something has to be done.





We think that our organization can make a difference for uninsured young adults in Los Angeles. The ACA has already started impacting the lives of many and it will continue to do so through its full implementation. However, young adults of color are continually left out of education around health care. 





We believe that educating young Angelinos in lowincome communities of color about the ACA, equipping them with a mobile app to spread the information, and empowering them to lead the change in their communities will dramatically change the uninsured landscape in LA by 2050. In fact, the majority of that 39% of uninsured young Angelinos, should gain access to affordable health coverage either through MediCal or subsidies in the exchange if we are successful. With health insurance, young Angelinos will be more able and willing to seek need medical care, preventive care and treatment for chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma from local hospitals, community health centers, and other providers. Over the long run, young Angelinos will see better health outcomes and greater financial security.





Moreover, as young adults use our app, get engaged, get informed and get insured, we will see increased youth engagement and leadership, particularly in communities of color.  The younger generations needs to be informed about health care and need to understand the importance of hearing and voicing the stories of marginalized communities that are too often left when health policy decisions are made. Through the Young Promoter program, and by reaching out to young adults in lowincome communities of color in 2013 and 2014, we can help to develop a next generation of leaders in Los Angeles.  Together alumni of our Young Promoters and those they have impacted will help to ensure that all young adults can afford quality insurance, and ultimately, lead healthier lives."

The physical, emotional, and social needs of boys and their mothers in absentfather homes is the central focus of the programs provided by Young Warriors.


Young Warriors is life education, things one should learn from a father.  YW participants learn life skills such as changing a tire, how to treat women respectfully, trusting others, dealing with finances, pursuing a college education,  workreadiness skills, anger management, conflict resolution, teambuilding skills, nutrition and health management, and much, much more all while having FUN!  YW is somewhere to turn for advice and answers that many children from fatherless homes do not have.","YW started with a relationship between Jason Hill and one 10yearold boy named Wonder.  Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life.  Wonder is now on a  healthy path and thriving.  In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. 


	Wonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors.  During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons.  YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends.  The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events.  YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%.   Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors.  In addition, grades are showing improvement.


	YW has expanded its program throughout the community.  YW  community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of  Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program.  YW now has two programs:  (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys.  Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools.  In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gangprevention units.  The waiting list for YW is growing with 100â€™s of kids waiting for the program to become available to them!","Galpin Ford, LAUSD, Frederick S. Upton Foundation, Mentor Management Systems, Nestle, Mil Milagros, various Marriage & Family Therapists, Adrienne Newsome, nonprofit counsel and many community volunteers and businesses.","1. YW uses standard psychological tests to measure selfesteem, selfefficacy, and negative risktaking behavior.


2. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from the participants, parents, mentors, YW staff, mentors, community volunteers, advisory, and board members via attendance records, grades, assessments, participation at all events and meetings, observations, and comments.  


3. Before, during, termination, and posttermination program assessments and evaluations will be conducted.  


4. Teacher, school officials, and other professional recommendations and input are considered.  


5. Recommendations, assessments, and evaluations will be reviewed by the program director, family therapist,  and YW Advisory Board as necessary.  


6. Livescan screening and â€œbest practicesâ€ training methods insure that participants have well qualified mentors.","Based on statistics from the California Family Council, children from fatherless homes are more likely to: commit suicide, be poor, drop out of school, have maladaptive behavior, be abused, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away, join gangs, wind up in state institutions or on state welfare, or be killed.  Young Warrior changes these boys future for the betterment of themselves and society.


1. The first objective of YW is to increase selfesteem and selfefficacy in boys whose identity is lost and who are at risk of becoming another troubling statistic.  YW mentors inspire boys discover their own strengths, take on new challenges, and face their failures as well as their victories.  In these critical life lessons, YW mentors develop trust with participants so that the participants are able to hear good advice, and therefore, become good decision makers.





2. The second objective of YW is to encourage and develop positive interpersonal communication amongst participants, mentors, peers, parents, guardians, teachers, and authorities.  YW mentors  promote diversity and respect for others by modeling selfdiscipline, integrity, honesty, compassion, forgiveness, ethical and moral behavior.  YW starts cultivating these skills in the home by collaborating with a local Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) in creating a parent education program.  This curriculum assists parents become more effective in the lives of their boys.





3. Finally, YW third objective is to prevent negative, risktaking behavior, including gang prevention.  YW reduces the need to find security in gangs, substance abuse, or the like by instilling worth and confidence in participant's abilities.  YW participants learn anger management, conflict resolution, and how to engage themselves in  healthy, positive affiliations with others.","Success would look like having an after school program in every LAUSD school or independent school systems.  Success will be Young Warriors of the next generation being mentored by alumni.  Success will be Young Warriors being the capable and upstanding leaders and fathers of tomorrow.  Success would be social connectedness of family.  Most importantly to these boys, true success would be the presence of a father of character back in the lives of the family.  Dads, we need you!"
3102278,2013278,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/PromiseNeighborhood.html,Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood: Transforming Public Education, Education,"Promise Neighborhoods is President Obamaâ€™s signature education and poverty initiative to transform schools and communities into vibrant centers of excellence and opportunity. Based on the Harlem Childrenâ€™s Zone model, the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood (LAPN) led by the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) offers a blueprint for success in Los Angeles in 2050. YPI was awarded a $30 million Promise Neighborhood implementation grant in December 2012 by the U.S. Department of Education, one of only seven grants awarded nationwide. Los Angeles is the largest city in the US to be recognized with a Promise Neighborhood award. At the heart of the LAPN will be a cradletocareer continuum of services in the communities of Hollywood and Pacoima. School transformation will be at the core of community transformation. The LAPN will be a zone of choice for families, with an array of highquality traditional, charter, pilot, and partnership schools. The LAPN goal is to have young children entering school ready to learn, students achieving at high levels, and youth graduating from high school prepared for college and careers. Families will enjoy safe, connected neighborhoods with economic opportunities and clear pathways to success.





How do we get there? By working together (LAPN has over 60 public and private partners) to break down silos and eliminate waste while getting the most from limited resources. The heart of LAPN is an innovative publicprivate partnership that blends diverse funding streams around a core set of outcomes and objectives that improve education while fighting poverty. LAPN is transforming 19 neighborhood schools in Hollywood and Pacoima into fullservice community schools while opening six Promise Neighborhood Centers and dozens of satellite centers to support families. This is the educational model for Los Angeles in 2050.





YPI has worked for over a decade building this continuum of cradlethroughcollegeandcareer programs that link together to ensure that children and families access needed support. These efforts have been jumpstarted by the Promise Neighborhoods implementation grant awarded in 2012. YPI is ready to expand this continuum, which includes services like afterschool tutoring, early education programs, health and nutrition programs, college and career readiness workshops, job training, and  public computer centers with access to broadband technology.





LAPN serves Pacoima and Hollywood distressed neighborhoods with low performing schools, high rates of poverty, and low rates of educational attainment. Only 36% of LAPN students are at or above grade level in English Language Arts and 34% in math compared to 48% and 46% of LAUSD students. The LAPN graduation rate is 54%  much lower than the LAUSD graduation rate of 64%. 





YPI and LAPN commit to making major improvements on all five My LA2050 Education metrics, because school transformation and wraparound support that move the needle on all metrics is the only way LA can keep its promise to students for a high quality public education. LAPN transforms schools with parents, principals, and teachers through teacher professional development for effective and datadriven teaching and the use of Academic Coaches and Tutors at each school. YPI's EffortstoOutcomes longitudinal data system tracks student achievement and needs to evaluate best methods to help them learn. An Early Warning System identifies atrisk students based on grades, attendance, and other indicators associated with dropping out, and provide academic interventions to help students succeed. All 19 LAPN schools (both LAUSD and charter schools) become FullService Community Schools that offer youth and families wraparound services such as nutrition and wellness programs, ESL and GED classes, academic tutoring and enrichment, gang and drug prevention, digital literacy, college and career preparation, financial literacy, and referrals for other services. 





YPI has built a unique publicprivate partnership with the County and City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Unified School District, LA Area Chamber of Commerce, and communitybased organizations that provides academic support, mentoring, digital literacy, college and career readiness programs, health and mental health services, wellness and physical activity, case management, financial literacy, among other programs.  LAPN blends multiple funding streams in support of common objectives articulated in a shared Memorandum of Understanding. 





What does this mean? LAPN partners have committed to integrate services into the cradlethroughcollegeandcareer continuum to achieve shared goals. By blending funding in this way, LAPN uses resources more efficiently, while simultaneously increasing the impact of each individual service. Partners also commit to sharing data in order to evaluate program impact.





A new way to work together to help youth and families succeed. Thatâ€™s the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood.


","YPI has been a leader in education and community empowerment since 1983. YPI created the first national antipoverty program based on a community action approach, in which local organizations could operate federally funded program with community input. YPI continues that work in Los Angeles and now serves over 100,000 Angelenos each year at 125 sites throughout the city with education, technology, and training programs. YPI is a recipient of U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's Excellence in Education Award, and has also been recognized by Cisco's Growing with Technology Award, as a National Council of La Raza Affiliate of the Year. YPI has been honored as an international ComputerWorld Honors Laureate for our 80 Public Computer Centers serving families with broadband services and access throughout the city. YPI's Hollywood FamilySource Center received a 2012 California Award for Performance Excellence by the California Council for Excellence.





While we are proud of these achievements, YPI is most proud of the direct impact our agency has in the lives of lowincome youth and adults in Los Angeles. Our staff of over 800, many of whom come from the communities we serve, are dedicated to doing whatever is needed to ensure youth have the resources and skills to graduate college and career ready. YPI's recent accomplishments include opening the San Fernando Institute of Applied Media (SFiAM) in 2010 on the campus of San Fernando Middle School, a persistently lowestachieving school. SFiAM increased its API score from 629 to 704 (+75 points) in two years. Notably, SFiAM has surpassed the achievement of San Fernando Middle School in only two years of operation, thanks to the hard work and dedication of teachers, the principal, other school staff, and the programs YPI provides on campus, including an afterschool program, AmeriCorps tutoring, parent education workshops, an iMac computer lab, and a School2Home program that provides all students with iPads. YPI's LA CollegeReady program trained 129 College Ambassadors who assisted 2,115 high school students and 900 parents prepare for college, including helping with applications, financial aid, and learning more about college options. 





Beyond the numbers, YPI staff makes other differences. In 2011, ""Maria"" and her son were referred to YPI by Maria's job training program. Maria was keeping her son home from middle school because he was being recruited by an area gang. YPI staff immediately intervened by connecting Maria and her son with the onsite LAUSD counselor, who enrolled Maria's son in a new school that same day.  Last year ""Maria"" and her daughter participated in YPI's Just Me and My Parent early childhood education classes. When Maria's daughter began preschool this past fall, her teacher was impressed by her fine motor skill development and ability to adapt to preschool. Maria expressed how grateful she was for YPI's early education program and how it has helped her and her daughter tremendously. 


","The LA Promise Neighborhood partnership is a unique collaborative of over 60 public, private, and philanthropic organizations that include the County and City of LA, LA Unified School District, First 5 LA, LA Area Chamber of Commerce, and the United Way of Greater LA. In addition, dozens of local neighborhoodbased nonprofits are partners, including CA Emerging Technology Fund, Boys and Girls Club of San Fernando Valley, Hollywood Wilshire YMCA, the Actors' Gang, El Nido Family Centers, Harmony Project, Hollygrove, LA Universal Preschool, Northeast Valley Health Corp., Saban Free Clinic, Thai Community Development Center, Armenian National Committee of America  Western Region, FAME Assistance Corp., and Public Council, and others.  ","YPI will evaluate the success of the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood by tracking progress toward achieving performance outcomes for each metric (described in the previous section). Success comes from the improvement of schools in the neighborhood and the continued achievement of LAPN families, which provide the framework of success required to expand this model across Los Angeles by 2050.





LAPN uses the Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) longitudinal data management system customized to track all outcome measures in the LAPN. This powerful system not only evaluates programs, it can also be used to design and implement effective interventions and plan for future programs (through the Early Warning System discussed above).  ETO is versatile and configured to support specific program needs for data entry, data management and reporting. Each LAPN program has its own programspecific, sitelevel data system. These collect data and feed into a centralized location, known as the Enterprise. Within the Enterprise level, YPI's Director of Research and Evaluation can analyze data for the entire agency, and for LAPN.  Using ETO, LAPN staff measures the impact of a single service on an individual (e.g. whether a student's grades increase after a semester of tutoring). They measure collective impact of multiple services on an individual (e.g. whether a student's grades increase after a semester of tutoring and participation in an afterschool program). They measure familylevel impact of services (e.g. impact of student receiving tutoring and parent receiving job training), as well as aggregate impact by sitelevel, neighborhoodlevel, or by demographics (e.g. improvement in a school's API score, impact of all services on overall neighborhood poverty, or impact on a specific group, such as Latino male youth ages 1421). 





Data sharing among public and private agencies is rare and difficult to achieve, due to privacy concerns, inability to properly collect and analyze performance data, and indifference to collaboration. Despite these barriers, YPI and the LAPN have made significant strides in this area. The City of LA has identified YPI as a potential pilot grantee to use ETO at YPI's Cityfunded Hollywood FamilySource Center and lead the City in a possible conversion of City data systems to ETO. YPI was selected by Social Solutions as a Certified Implementation Partner to provide technical assistance and expertise on the use of ETO. LAUSD has agreed to import student and schoollevel data into ETO, which is a major milestone for the project. 





My LA2050 grant funds will strengthen LAPN's evaluation plan by hiring a Cross Sector Coordinator to work with partners to develop detailed data sharing agreements and assist with the logistics of setting up partners' ETO Data Portals, which link directly to YPI's centralized Enterprise data system to aggregate results. My LA2050 will also help with the costs of ETO licenses for YPI and partners. 


","LAPN will transform lowperforming schools into high achieving learning centers. The LAPN school transformation model can be replicated throughout the City so that all children have access to an excellent education that prepares them for college and careers. YPI has developed performance measures to track progress toward achieving goals that demonstrate specific and quantifiable ways that LAPN will benefit Los Angeles and make significant progress on the Education metrics within five years.





Metric: Test Scores


  Increase percentage of students who achieve score at or above grade level on the CA Standards Test in math from 34% to 67% and English Language Arts from 36% to 69%.


  API scores will increase to exceed the CA goal of 800 within five years.


  English Language Learners who score proficient on the CELDT test will increase by 8 percentage points each year.


  Special education students who score at or above grade level in math and ELA will increase by 7 percentage points each year.





Metric: High School Completion & Drop Rates


  Increase high school graduation rates from 54% to 87%.


  Increase attendance rates by 0.30.5 percentage points each year; decrease truancy rates by 45 percentage points each year.


  Increase high school students passing the CA High School Exit Exam by 2 percentage points each year. 


  Reenroll 100 outofschool youth back in high schools each year, and increase percent of outofschool youth who obtain a diploma or certificate from 55% to 75%. 





Metric: CollegeGoing Rates


  Increase  percentage of students passing AG courses with a ""C"" or better from 45% to 85%.


  Increase percentage of LAPN high school students who graduate with a regular high school diploma and obtain a postsecondary degree, vocational certificate, or other certification/credential from 40% to 72%.


  Increase percentage of parents who complete college workshops and demonstrate knowledge of how to support children through the college process to 98% by year 5.


  Increase percentage of middle school students with a collegeadvancement action plan by the end of 8th grade from 65% to 90%.





Metric: Preschool Participation


  Increase percentage of children from birth to kindergarten entry who participate in Centerbased or formal homebased early learning programs from 48% to 73%.


  Increase percentage of three year olds who demonstrate ageappropriate functioning across multiple domains from 57% to 77% and children in kindergarten from 41% to 65%.





Metric: Afterschool & Summer School Enrichment


  Increase percentage of students in the Promise Neighborhood who participate in high quality learning activities during out of school hours from 47% to 72%.





When LAPN achieves these outcomes, Los Angeles will benefit from a welleducated workforce prepared for high wage jobs. This results in higher tax revenues and a stronger economy, with less need for expenditures on social assistance. 


","Success in 2050 is a Los Angeles where all children start life with access to high quality health and early education services so they enter kindergarten ready to learn. It's a Los Angeles where all K12 students achieve at or above grade level. It's a Los Angeles where 100% of students graduate from high school and enter the college or career of their choosing. It's a Los Angeles where all youth can participate in afterschool and summer enrichment programs to develop their creative and extracurricular interests. It's a Los Angeles that embraces the LAPN educational model to achieve these goals.





We believe this model is the best way to make real progress on the Education metrics to achieve success. Innovative features like partnerships that blend funding to achieve common outcomes will make significantly more progress than agencies working in silos and duplicating efforts. Forwardlooking commitments to comprehensive data management and evaluation will keep the initiative on track to achieve goals and outcomes. 





The Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood has the potential to transform not only Los Angeles, but communities throughout the state and country by proving the effectiveness of placebased strategies that saturate communities in need with a cradlethroughcollegeandcareer continuum to eradicate poverty and create vibrant communities of opportunity. Groundbreaking LAPN partnerships with the City and County of LA and Los Angeles Unified School District seamlessly link public and private services in the LAPN to provide targeted services geared to the needs of youth and families in specific neighborhoods. 





We know that this community can and will rise to the occasion, joining forces to demonstrate to a national audience that Los Angeles is ready to fully engage and lead signature national efforts like Promise Neighborhoods. We need your help to build on this momentum so that Maria and her son, and all of us who call Los Angeles home, can look toward a brighter future. We stand ready to rally the leadership of our region and help LAPN define new and permanent pathways to success for all in Los Angeles by 2050.

3102279,2013279,http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/youthspeak.html,Future Leaders Initiative  Listen to the Leaders of Tomorrow. , Social Connectedness,"<p>By 2050, the youth of today will be the generation that inherits Los Angeles. They will be the ones making decisions about the city's economy, transportation, housing, education, and everything that impacts Los Angelenos 37 years from now. One of them may even be the mayor in 2050. So why are we not listening to them?    </p>





<p>Youth Speak Collective (YSC) will address this issue of social connectedness and apathy using our Future Leaders Initiative, a youthdriven leadership training campaign that pairs high school students throughout the City of Los Angeles with business and community professionals. Over the course of six months, each student will participate in an intensive training, mentoring and civic learning curriculum with their paired professional, in preparation to be one of Los Angeles's future 2050 leaders. Students will learn about civic engagement, social entrepreneurship, and creative leadership from their mentoring professionals, culminating in a servicelearning project where each youth/adult pair work together to solve a Los Angeles community issue.</p>





<p>It is our belief that youth are simply not given enough credit. When given the opportunity, they have the drive and ability to surprise us with amazing ideas. Through genuine listening , strategic mentoring and engaged coaching, we can tap into the fresh outlook and wisdom of youth in our currently estranged communities. The guidance and mentorship of invested, caring adults can help transform Los Angeles into a socially connected, civically active community.</p>





<p>The following outline briefly summarizes the actions steps of the Future Leaders Initiative.</p>





<p>â€¢	Pair 50 high school students and 50 professionals from the five core areas in Los Angeles: South Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Central Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, and San Fernando Valley</p>


<p>â€¢	Professionals will mentor, train, and coach youth for six months using a â€œCommunity Impactâ€ curriculum</p>


<p>â€¢	Professionals will meet with the youth for at least eight hours a month</p>


<p>â€¢	Students will be tasked with selecting a real world problem in their community to solve through a service learning project</p>


<p>â€¢	After completion of curriculum, students will be required to select a nonprofit partner that is working to address the community problem they have selected to resolve in order to leverage outreach and implementation of their service learning project</p>


<p>â€¢	Service learning projects will involve local elected offices, small businesses, and community groups to maximize social connectedness and impact </p>


<p>â€¢	Program will culminate in a Future Leaders conference where all participating students and professionals gather to present their projects and solutions to Los Angeles stakeholders, such as city officials, business executives, and nonprofit leaders. </p>","<p>YSC's greatest achievement is actually following through on our youthdriven philosophy. We listen carefully to what the youth want and need and work with them to implement their ideas. This youth/adult collaboration has created effective programs that youth gravitate toward and has brought about the following achievements in just seven short years.</p>





<p>â€¢	Project Kawazoe  A droughttolerant, Japaneseinspired pocket park in Pacoima, designed and built by students in the community. </p>


<p>â€¢	Club Futbolito  A free club soccer program for atrisk youth, serving over 1000 players </p>


<p>â€¢	Pacoima Neighborhood Partnership â€“ A founding member of a community led forum of over 50 community members, nonprofits, forprofits, elected offices, law enforcement, educators and students who meet monthly to discuss community issues and come up with viable solutions</p>


<p>â€¢	Creation of ten murals and developing more in the Northeast San Fernando Valley</p>


<p>â€¢	Project Youth Green  a fouracre community garden and activity space in the heart of Pacoima</p>


<p>â€¢	Youth Speak Media Solutions  A social enterprise that provides youth with jobs in the digital arts and film industry</p>


<p>â€¢	Creation of over twenty marketing films for local businesses and Los Angeles based nonprofits</p>


<p>â€¢	Creative Tech Center  An arts center and open computer lab in the Northeast San Fernando Valley</p>","<p>We plan to work with and actively collaborate with the following nonprofit partners: Youth Justice Coalition, Proyecto Pastoral, Boys and Girls Club of Venice, and Unusual Suspects Theatre Company. We plan to reach out to other organizations throughout Los Angeles in our target communities once the campaign is funded. </p>





<p>We plan to partner also with many excellent and established leadership programs: New Leaders Council, HUBLos Angeles, Coro Southern California, LURNLeadership for Urban Renewal Now, LA Leadership Network, Executive Service Corps and the Center for Nonprofit Management.  Through these prominent leadership development organizations we plan to recruit adult allies and mentors for our youth across Los Angeles. </p>","<p>Social Connectedness attempts to measure the frequency of contact with others, quality of personal relationships, and civic and social engagement. We project that these short term goals will make a powerful impact throughout Los Angeles.</p>





<p>Outcome #1: One hundred percent of students should be able to demonstrate problemsolving and project management skills through the completion of a service learning project. Evidence of this will be present in the quality and presentation of each servicelearning project at the Future Leaders conference. Attending community and business leaders will evaluate the projects at the conference. These scores and qualitative comments will be collected and aggregated by the Program Coordinator.</p>





<p>Outcome #2: Eighty percent of both students and adults should feel a desire to be more civicminded. At the end of the program, all participants will be required to complete a postsurvey evaluating their interest in volunteerism, voting and social engagement.</p>





<p>Outcome #3: Sixty percent of business and community leaders at the Future Leaders conference will see the value of the youthdriven solutions presented to combat current community issues. This will be evaluated by how many of the student solutions are actually integrated and implemented by Los Angeles' current leaders.</p>","The Future Leaders Initiative has both an immediate and longterm impact in Los Angeles. The 100 individuals initially involved in the program will feel an immediate social connectedness to each other and their community. This intergenerational relationship building will make a powerful impact across generations. The mentorship relationship provides professionals with an important volunteer opportunity that has an effect long after the mentorship is over. The student finds an adult ally that actually listens and cares about what they have to say and contribute. To give voice is to give a stake in the public discourse, and that is what the Future Leaders Initiative strives to do.








As adult stakeholders, participating professionals may be inspired to volunteer more or become more involved in local government. As young stakeholders, students will become more civicminded, attend more volunteer events and be motivated to simply vote in order to get their voice heard. And with involvement of many community partners throughout the process, we are breathing new life into a city where people care, citizens care, and neighbors talk to each other.








In the longterm, the same students who were active in the program may be the next business executives, city councilmembers or nonprofit leaders of 2050. They already have experience in collaborating and communicating with one another due to their work within the Future Leaders Initiative so the social connectedness is already present. These are the individuals that others follow. If they set a good example and affect change in their social spheres, a domino effect of social awareness, civic engagement, and increased volunteerism among Los Angelenos citywide is possible. We are simply asking for adults to listen and for the youth to take action.


","<p>The year 2050 would be characterized by social engagement, strong community values and collaborations. They are the keys to connectedness and the weapons against apathy. We believe that by connecting youth, adult allies, nonprofits, and local businesses, we can tackle all of the LA2050 indicators and link parts of Los Angeles through its residents.</p>





<p>Success in 2050 would be a model for other major cities. We would see more engaged citizens, increased voter turnout, and triple the amount of volunteers at nonprofits. All businesses would incorporate strong philanthropic values into their corporate structure and nonprofits would actively partner with each other to continue striving toward social connectedness.</p>





<p>Success in 2050 means that our youth leaders of today become our next city council members of Los Angeles and leading nonprofits and businesses that make real lasting impact. They are the next leaders in science, art and social welfare who give back to the same communities where they grew up. The year 2050 would be vibrant with social bonds that also make a community impact, whether great or small.</p>"
