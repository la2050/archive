5102321,#FeedtheDolphins,2015213,,,"Tiny Rebellion will use the $100,000 dollar grant to create a campaign around four unrecognized dolphin statues located in the Santa Monica area that serve as donation points for the cities homeless service agencies. The #FeedtheDolphins campaign will include lead up promotions to a one-day experiential event that will raise awareness for the existing donation program, and show how the local community can use their spare change to make a big difference.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Live,"In an effort to create positive change in the local community, Tiny Rebellion devoted a summer to solving the homeless problem in Santa Monica. After conducting research on both the Santa Monica resident and homeless population, the agency realized a connection needed to be made between the local community and vagrant society. 
 
 City data states downtown Santa Monica attracts 40,000 visitors a day, many of whom come for the purpose of shopping. On average, locals spend $43 dollars per trip, which if you take just a quarter of the daily visitors, still adds up to $430,000 dollars spent per day. 
 
 Scattered throughout the commercial district of Santa Monica are four dolphin statues built by the city to solicit donations to local homeless service agencies. The installations are large -bronze- structures placed in various social hubs, but while the resources are in place to support this program, the dolphins only bring in $10,000 dollars a year because they are not advertised to the public.
 
 Tiny Rebellion wants to change this. The #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect the Santa Monica community to an existing city program that empowers residents to fight homelessness in their daily routine. The dolphin statues are a great way to turn shoppers spare change into positive change, but they need an agency behind them to kick-start their success. Tiny Rebellion will put it’s advertising know how to create a one-day experiential event to raise awareness for the dolphin donation statues. 
 
 The agency will build a large cardboard structure around one dolphin that is animated by LED projections. Brand ambassadors will show curious passerby’s how to donate, and each time a person contributes a digital block will appear showing the price of a basic necessity (toiletries, clean clothes, access to internet, ect.). Over the course of the day these small purchases -donations- will build up like bricks showing how small change can help someone move from homeless to housed. At the end of the event the completed home will contain information on local NGO’s allowing visitors to further connect with homeless service agencies in their area. 
 
 By advertising an existing program, the #FeedtheDolphins campaign will connect Santa Monica residents to a solution for homelessness shifting the mindset of the community from passive concern to active problem solving.","A major challenge will be educating the public on the importance of incorporating #FeedtheDolphins into their daily routine. The campaign may attract an increase in initial donations, but the program will only become a success if the Santa Monica community continues to actively contribute after the one-day event. In order to overcome this challenge, Tiny Rebellion will position the pop-up installation as an educational experience. Visitors will learn about the locations of the dolphins, the local services they support, and how their spare change can add up to make a lasting difference. The goal of event will be to inspire residents to incorporate #FeedtheDolphins into their daily routine.","We understand that metrics are essential to evaluate the success of the LA2050 goals. Through communication with the city government, Tiny Rebellion found that on average, the dolphin statues bring in $10,000 dollars a year for local homeless service agencies. Tiny Rebellion will measure the success of the campaign by evaluating how much donations increase from previous years. By creating a splash page and social media network around #FeedtheDolphins, the agency will also be able to gauge the lasting impression of the pop-up installation, and community engagement with fighting homelessness.","What is unique about our proposed campaign is that currently no one else is activating the dolphins, or even bringing attention to them. We have identified a system that is already in place, but need funding to let our agency discover its real potential.",Tiny Rebellion will work primarily with the city of Santa Monica on the #FeedtheDolphins campaign. The majority of the grant will be put towards the pop-up installation with the city only receiving payments for event location permits. Any remaining money after the event will be used to maintain the life of the campaign on all social media channels.,"Tiny Rebellion worked with its in-house production team to draft two official budgets for the #FeedtheDolphins campaign. The agency estimates that dependent upon vendor costs, the project will run between $83,325.61 and $99,737.79. Tiny Rebellion has close working relationships with a number of vendors. The agency is confident that it can negotiate a budget within the $100,000 dollar cap. If the grand total does exceed the LA2050 grant, the agency will either cover the difference out of pocket, or shift some of the work internal to reduce the final cost.","Vendor Hard Cost Budget:
 - Cardboard Structure with Internal Frame and Signage: $39,706.88
 - Exterior Projections (Static): $4,706.00
 - Interior Projection with Motion-Sensor LED Trigger and (1) Color Wash: $8,823.75
 - Event Location Permits: $9,412.00
 - 24HR Security/Ambassadors (during installation, activation, and dismantle): $6,000.15
 - Installation Supervision, Labor, and Equipment: $10,588.50
 - Warehouse Handling and Transportation: $2,117.70
 - Travel (assume all-day activation & overnight dismantle): $1,911.81
 - Projected Sales Tax: $3,529.50
 - Project Management: $12,941.50
 - Grand Total: $99,737.79
 
 This budget reflects the absolute hard costs from vendors. A second budget, drafted of the same expenses, found that the project would cost $83,325.61, which reflects a more accurate grand total of the campaign. The Immediate pricing from vendors are often much hire than what the agency ends up paying.","To scale the success of the event Tiny Rebellion would take a two pronged approach to not only increase local engagement with #FeedtheDolphins, but also expand the program to other areas of Los Angeles. In conjunction with the city, Tiny Rebellion would tap into the thriving art community in Santa Monica to host competitions for local artists to decorate the four dolphins. Similar to how other cities have iconic animal statues, such as the Chicago cows, the Santa Monica dolphins would become celebrated icons of the West Side community. The agency would also work with the city to update the statue plaques to provide more information on the donation programs, and the #FeedtheDolphins campaign. 
 After the initial success of the #FeedtheDolphins campaign in Santa Monica, Tiny Rebellion would like to expand the program across greater Los Angeles. The agency would use this campaign as a case study to partner with other city governments and business hubs to build donation statues in other commercial areas. By giving neighborhoods across the city ‘dolphins’ of their own, the #FeedtheDolphins campaign will not only bring together the West Side community, but has the potential to connect all of Los Angeles to the homeless situation."

These programs will include outreach to LA's underserved communities, and also specialized educational initiatives for LA's creative youth and senior populations.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"Thanks to recent advances in digital technologies, there has been a renewed enthusiasm for all things 3-D. From record-breaking box office returns of 3-D movies to the new public interest in virtual reality, 3-D is back in the spotlight. 
  
 But most people aren't aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. We want to create a center to celebrate the work of the many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future.
 
 Our goals include:
  
 - A Museum of permanent collections on display to educate about the history of 3-D art and science.
 
 - A Gallery of curated exhibits by recent and current 3-D content creators.
 
 - A Theater to screen 3-D films and other related cinematic works, and to host lectures and presentations.
 
 - A Library of 3-D books, movies, and other media.
 
 - A Classroom devoted to teaching the techniques and methods of 3-D image creation through classes and workshops for the public, including special outreach and educational programs for youth and seniors.
 
 Research has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts connected to STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both areas.
 
 Additionally, the use of stereoscopic 3-D in the classroom has repeatedly proven to provide markedly higher rates of comprehension and retention of information by students, yet 3-D is not widely understood or implemented by educators or industries.
 
 Our initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education.","We are currently an organization without our own facility. We need to raise the funds to purchase a building to house our center. We have located a building for sale in the NoHo Arts District of Los Angeles that would be a perfect location for 3-D SPACE - The building has a theater, gallery, museum display areas, a classroom, reading room, and lots of additional space. USC has already donated to us a 40-foot silver screen which would make our 3-D theater and classroom possible. Now we have the daunting task of raising the funds to purchase this building, while also meeting our operating budget to allow the organization to function and carry out our mission and projects. While we are currently engaged in fundraising for our venue purchase, we have been offering programs throughout 2015 through partnerships and co-presentations with other organizations that have provided theater and teaching spaces. We will continue to build these relationships with other LA based nonprofits in 2016.","Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentations will be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape future programs.
 
 The many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to see, experience, and comment.
 
 Our internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities","The LA 3-D Club, founded in 1955, is the most active membership-based organization in the country for 3-D enthusiasts. Their monthly meetings allow 3-D image makers to share photos and videos, learn techniques, and socialize with other 3-D fans.
 
 The focus of 3-D SPACE is to increase engagement between these enthusiast communities, working professionals, and the public. 3-D SPACE founder Eric Kurland has over ten years of experience in connecting the public to the 3-D community. His work as the Director of the Annual LA 3-D Movie Festival and five years as the President of the LA 3-D Club, as well as his professional stereoscopic work in the entertainment industry (including 3-D Director for the Grammy nominated OK Go music video ALL IS NOT LOST, and Lead Stereographer for the Oscar nominated animated short MAGGIE SIMPSON IN THE LONGEST DAYCARE) puts 3-D SPACE in the position to be able to bring all aspects of the 3-D world together, from the fans, to the independent artists, to the professionals working in the entertainment industry.
  
 The 3-D SPACE Board of Directors is comprised of a team with strong backgrounds in the arts, non-profits and museums, education, and of course 3-D. We have also assembled a fantastic group of advisors to help round out our knowledge, and provide access to resources and information that will help us to become a vital and exciting organization.","There are many potential collaborators throughout the Los Angeles arts and education sectors, including the Columbia Memorial Space Center in Downey, California, LA Filmforum, the Velaslavasay Panorama, ScareLA, the Echo Park Film Center, Captured Aural Phantasty Theater, Monsterpalooza, Heritage Square Museum, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the LA 3-D Club, as well as other arts and science organizations, museums, galleries, libraries, and schools.

Our space will create this experience by offering a healthy sustainable environment that includes active jungle gyms, toys, enriched classes, educational activities, community events, and a space to enjoy organic and locally sourced food.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,"Baldwin hills, Leimert Park, Inglewood, and Mid-City",ALL,"Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA. Historically, South LA has a lack of access to safe play spaces and limited healthy food choices. This limits opportunities for children to play and for parents to connect in a public space. Tickleberry caters to Families of color (POC) with young children. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community and welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so families have healthful play spaces.
 
 Our environment is changing everyday and it is a mission for us to create a sustainable environment in our play space. Local businesses and corporations have a huge impact on the environment with large amounts of energy and water usage, as well as producing a large amount of waste. The daily operations and equipment will be sustainable by using energy efficient appliances in the kitchen, reusable utensils, and minimal paper waste. Tickleberry Place wants to be a solution by being a sustainable business that also educates the community on our practices and encourages the community to take on these practices at home.
  
 Our children are exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, we will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. To reduce the amount of germs on our equipment and toys, we will ensure that there is regular cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day.
  
 Another important aspect about Tickleberry Place is its food. There is a strong need in the community; Very few local restaurants provide organic, and healthier alternatives. In the facility, will be a full service kitchen that will be serving food made from fresh, clean, local, and organic ingredients. Tickleberry Place will offer a variety of choices that are fresh and modern, opposed to the large number of fast food restaurants in the area. Our menu will address the growing demand for healthier options in South Los Angeles.","The major challenge that Tickleberry Place faces is gaining access to funds to open our play space. It’s particularly difficult for small organizations such as Tickleberry Place to obtain capital to operate, especially when founded by People of Color (POC). To overcome that challenge we will continue to participate in the community to increase our following. For example, we do monthly activities for kids at the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market, as well as actively participating at the annual Community Garden Council Event. These events give us the support for when we go to investors.","Tickleberry Place will be nothing less than a top quality facility and will raise the value of the community. We will evaluate our work in the areas of Health, Sustainability, as well as Social and Economic Growth. 
 
 Health will be evaluated by the number of families we impact, obesity rating of Los Angeles community overtime, relationships and an increased demand for healthier food options in our community. 
 
 We will evaluate our sustainability work based on the number of families and organizations that take on more sustainable practices at home and in our community. Through education we will positively impact behavior where more local businesses, families, and communities are recycling materials and using toxic-free products. 
 
 Lastly, we will measure the number of children enrolled in our education programs, participation at community events, increase in employment opportunities, and expansion in various small business and services available in South LA.","Direct Local Competitors:

 There are a few places that are doing similar work in the Los Angeles area. Tickleberry Place has competition from Giggles N Hugs, Kiddie City LA, and Under the Sea Playground.
 
 What is unique about Tickleberry Place is that we will provide an improved experience for the entire family by having a clean and toxic-free indoor play space with a full service organic food restaurant. Having an indoor space is an alternative to outdoor parks when Los Angeles experiences climate change and during nighttime hours. In addition, upkeep for parks is not consistent. Our play space will be regularly monitored to insure a clean space and will be accessible throughout the day. 
 
 What is also unique about our approach is that we are conducive to the environment, familiar with the community’s needs, and will be in a location that serves progressive families with lack of play spaces. Having Tickleberry Place located in the South Los Angeles area gives us of advantage of providing for an underserved community. Most importantly, Tickleberry Place will act as a community partner for families in South Los Angeles.","We do not have direct collaborators for the LA2050 Grant challenge that will receive portions of the funding. We currently have partnerships that benefit from our work and impacting our community. For example, we have a partnership with the Baldwin Hills Farmers’ Market where the community benefits from our presence by bringing more families to the the farmers market.

5102057,A Peaceful Los Angeles: Developing the Hearts and Minds of Our Future Leaders,2016038,,,"In order to fulfill our mission, Citizens of the World seeks to construct a rich, comprehensive social-emotional learning (SEL) program, as we believe self-regulation and social connection are essential components of every child’s development. Including SEL in everyday instruction allows for deeper, longer-term learning to occur. Ultimately, we envision that students who have built strong social-emotional competencies will become better citizens of our complex, diverse, and ever-changing world.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Diverse communities throughout LA including Hollywood, Silver Lake, and Mar Vista",Learn,"As one of the largest, most diverse cities in the world, Los Angeles has endured significant inter-group conflict and civil unrest. Furthermore, our city's schools have struggled to prepare students for academic and societal success. CWC LA intends to make Los Angeles a better place to learn, connect, and live by cultivating social-emotional health in our students and by training our next generation of citizens to work together productively. 
 
 CWC believes social-emotional learning to be as integral to an excellent education as traditional academic subjects and, moreover, views it as necessary for the world in which we live. SEL involves both learning about oneself, in the form of self-awareness and self-management, and others, in the form of social awareness, empathy, compassion and collaboration. 
 
 CWC's model focuses on two broad aspects of social-emotional learning: 1) comprehension and 2) execution. Social-emotional comprehension pertains to the mental processes involved in encoding, interpreting, and reasoning about social and emotional information, and in controlling one’s thoughts and emotions. Examples include emotion recognition, perspective taking, social problem solving, and self-control. Social-emotional execution involves the behaviors expressed in social interactions that are designed to achieve social goals. These pro-social behaviors include the formation of friendships and social connections, and the reduction/resolution of social conflicts. 
 
 Social-emotional learning is highly consequential with positive impacts seen across behavioral, academic, mental health and social domains. According to a meta-analysis of school-based SEL programs conducted by Durlak, et all (2011), SEL programs “significantly improve students’ skills, attitudes, and behaviors”. In fact, strong SEL leads to better academic outcomes, relationships, participation in school, mental health and behavioral outcomes, and social acceptance. 
 
 Already, CWC LA's schools have experienced these benefits firsthand. As we expand our region's SEL program across our three diverse schools, we anticipate we will help move the needle on key education metrics for Los Angeles including: test scores, school safety, high school graduation, truancy, suspensions/expulsions, and ultimately college completion rates. We will also impact our students beyond school, with positive effects in resilience, mental health, social connection, safety and embracing diversity.","While some skepticism remains among the general public about the value of ""soft skills"" such as mindfulness and emotional regulation, there is mounting empirical and anecdotal evidence that SEL works—across sectors as varied as business and medicine. 
 
 As a data-driven organization, Citizens of the World Los Angeles, seeks to better evaluate the real impact of our SEL program on students. Given the relatively new nature of this work, SEL assessments for schools are still limited in quantity, quality, and usability. Further, many existing assessments are not fully aligned with our unique SEL model and the targeted outcomes for students (""self,"" ""together,"" ""world""). 
 
 To overcome these challenges, CWC LA and our national CWC support network will continue to work with researchers on developing additional, more customized SEL assessment tools. For example, we are participating in a pilot program with an external provider to develop SEL assessments for grades four and up.","CWC LA evaluates our work across three core program elements: academic excellence, diversity, and community. SEL is imbedded in each of these elements and helps us drive toward general mission fulfillment. Therefore, we will look at comprehensive measures such as academic achievement and diverse stakeholder engagement when we contemplate the effectiveness of SEL.
 
 CWC LA will evaluate our SEL program with focused measures as well. Our assessment tools will assess mastery of SEL concepts such as emotion recognition, perspective taking, social problem solving, delay of gratification and frustration tolerance. We will utilize student input to create social network maps that will help teachers understand and facilitate social connections in the classrooms. Teachers will also observe SEL execution and student behavior using standardized scoring rubrics. Finally, we will seek formal and qualitative parent and principal feedback about our students' social-emotional learning and behaviors.","Many individuals and institutions are beginning to use mindfulness to improve productivity and happiness. A number of other schools, including private schools, are also starting to include SEL in their instruction.
 
 We believe CWC's approach is unique in that SEL is explicitly part of our philosophical foundation and is deeply embedded across our schools' curriculum. We truly believe that academic and social educations are dependent upon each other, and that student performance is heightened by the immersion of SEL into the core instruction. Where others may include it, CWC embeds it. 
 
 SEL is interwoven with our pillars of diversity, community and academic excellence to uniquely prepare students to improve our complex society. At CWC LA, our high-performing schools reflect the diverse communities we serve. Approximately 50% of our students are individuals of color while approximately 40% of our students qualify for free/reduced lunch. Our collective student body speaks more than 19 languages. 
 
 CWC LA’s talented principals and teachers create safe learning environments where students can master social-emotional skills and learn how to engage respectfully and productively with fellow students, forming meaningful relationships that transcend cultural divides. We believe this learning environment will allow our students to achieve better academic results and will provide a powerful advantage in life. In turn, our graduates will be uniquely positioned to serve as positive influences and bridge-builders as they go on to work and live in diverse neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles and the world. 
 
 Recently, we developed a set of CWC-specific graduate dispositions that touch on the dimensions of self, together, and world. Internally, our graduates will work to become self-aware, ""response-able,"" confident, efficacious, agile, and courageous. In relation to others, CWC graduates will strive to be culturally competent, curious, empathetic, and compassionate. Within the world at large, our graduates will aim to be global, scholarly, systems thinkers. 
 
 Pioneering a deeply ingrained SEL model in a highly diverse public school setting, CWC LA is eager to collaborate with other like-minded schools and organizations interested in the SEL field. A recent LA Times profile of our students' mindfulness work may help illustrate some of the ways in which our classrooms operate uniquely. http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/28/health/la-he-kids-meditate-20140301","CWC LA is an independently operated, locally based organization that is fortunate to be part of the greater Citizens of the World Charter Schools (CWCS) national network. CWC LA also has “sister schools” in New York City, where CWC New York currently operates two elementary schools in Brooklyn. CWC Kansas City will open two Midtown schools in fall 2016.
 
 While each region of schools operates according to the unique needs of its communities, all CWC schools share a deep-seated commitment to social-emotional learning. Our national network, CWCS, is leading the way by forging partnerships with prominent researchers, nonprofit organizations and universities, and assessment providers working in the SEL field. At the regional and school levels, we are excited to share best practices and to begin the important work of codifying our SEL programs. Each school also has its own unique community partners who work with the schools to provide enrichment opportunities and/or lead voluntary mindfulness groups. For example, several Citizens of the World Mar Vista parents have been instrumental in engaging the school’s family community in their own parent-led mindfulness workshops. Filmmakers Julie Bayer Salzman and Josh Salzman created a short film entitled “Just Breathe” (https://youtu.be/RVA2N6tX2cg) after being inspired by their son’s SEL program at CWC.
 
 Going forward, CWC LA would like to expand our partnerships in the assessment and professional development arenas, amplifying our impact by closely tying assessments to both effective instructional practices and our own educational objectives. We are also seeking new collaborators who want to understand the latest research, share best practices, and help strengthen SEL programming for children across Los Angeles and the country. 
  
 If selected, CWC LA does not have any formal partners who would be sharing these particular grant funds.","We anticipate that the expansion and deepening of our SEL program will cost us approximately $300,000 in the 2015-16 school year. These costs include the expenses outlined in our detailed budget: leadership time from school administrators; additional time from SEL Coordinators at each school site; and services provided by the CWC Los Angeles region and national network (note that none of the grant funds will be spent to reimburse for these regional/national facilitation services).","Our budget for $100,000 is outlined below and includes the following line items:
 • A percentage of salary for each of our site’s SEL Coordinator or equivalent position. Percentages range from 5-15% depending on the site for a total cost of $27,018.
 • Consultants to help develop an advisory curriculum focused on SEL for our new 6th grade program for a cost of $2,500.
 • Teacher time to collaborate and be trained on how to implement and assess SEL practices. These sessions would be led by administrators, partners from CWC’s national organization, and other site-based staff such as the SEL Coordinators. Total time allocated is approximately 10% of professional development time during the school year for a total cost of $65,114.
 • Costs for assessments and instructional materials to implement SEL, assuming approximately $4 per student for a total cost of $5,368.","CWC LA is a growing region of schools in Los Angeles and an affiliate of a growing national network (with new CWC schools continuing to open in other cities across the country). This affords CWC LA some unique opportunities to leverage early SEL investments by expanding the program and by readily disseminating best practices. As the founding region of CWC, the Los Angeles region is leading the work nationally for CWC and will be able to expand our program both within our Los Angeles schools but also nationally to our New York and Kansas City regions.
 
 CWC LA's initial professional development costs are one of the program's most expensive components, but once techniques and culture are established at a given school, the SEL program can be easily maintained and built upon. Other early-stage programmatic costs include codification of the model and the purchasing and customization of instructional materials/assessments. 
 
 Overall, CWC LA's SEL program has established a strong foundation upon which to grow. Once our SEL program is fully built out, we anticipate it will be sustainable on public funding. 
 
 Again, we are excited about opportunities to expand our commitment to social-emotional learning, and we are eager to collaborate with any like-minded organizations or individuals to make Los Angeles a better place to learn, live and connect."
5102234,A shady oasis for everyone in Grand Park,2015154,,,"Our proposal supports the design/installation of shade structures in highly trafficked central gathering spaces for park events & weekly food truck events (22K DTLA residents & employees a year). Visitors consistently request additional shade particularly for our most vulnerable visitors; children and elders. Adding shade areas will increase capacity and enhance the comfort of the 1MM people who access Grand Park annually to play, enjoy quiet green spaces and attend free events in downtown LA.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Live,"Grand Park is the most popular green space in DTLA to play (1MM visitors per year) and is the first and only-large scale public park in DTLA that combines opportunities for multi-generational play with community well-being through hundreds of culturally diverse and free programs hosted in the park since our opening in 2012. Grand Park is dedicated to creating a safe and enjoyable space for everyone with family-oriented, no-alcohol large-scale events (4th of July, Día de los Muertos, New Year’s Eve) with no major incidents or arrests among crowds as large as 45K people. With 24/7 security, well maintained clean toilets, ample drinking water, a splash-pad for adult and child water play, food and beverage choices, the park is dedicated to offering a safe, clean and comfortable place for LA to play. Grand Park also features a children’s playground specifically designed to stimulate social, motor and cognitive skills through play. Providing children safe places to play is critical in their development and future success. The current lack of permanent shade structures, however, limits the use of some areas of the park. Creating more shade will increase the use of the park; provide UV protection, spaces for performances and exhibitions, and more activities for children and elders. With 2.6MM+ Angelinos living more than 1/4 mile from a park and Latino, African American and Asian Americans less likely to live near parks, Grand Park provides critical access to the 31K residents (US Census) (71% non-white) 500K employees and 10MM tourists that live/work in and visit DTLA. A growing body of research from UCLA, the CDC and the Surgeon General supports a direct correlation between access to parks and physical activity (play) with important psychological and social health benefits: relieves symptoms of depression/anxiety, improves mood and enhances psychological well-being. Parks, gardens and other natural places such as Grand Park make for more livable communities, opportunities for recreation, exercise, stronger social ties and a sense of community and increase social capital bringing diverse communities together to share experiences. Grand Park is a work in progress, constantly responding to the needs of our public, reflected in the evolution of public programs that build on each prior event and improvements made to the physical infrastructure to accommodate the growing audiences that have identified Grand Park as their favorite place to gather and play.","Grand Park is a resource to thousands on a daily basis. Over the past few years, it has entered into people’s routines and habits and they depend on it for lunch, for respite, and for gathering with friends, family, and colleagues. The process of installing shading, while a long-term benefit, will briefly interrupt this daily way of life for many. In order to overcome this, the park will need to work with neighbors and community stakeholders to share vision and timeline in order to build buy-in. The park will also need to ensure no interruption of programs such as concerts, lunch offerings, and health classes. This will require that we move some programs to other areas of the park and ongoing communication with park-goers.","Grand Park has established a vigorous network, via social media, with park-goers, nearby communities and programming partners. We rely on their constant input to evaluate our programs and services year round and will conduct outreach to survey their response to the new shade structure. We will also evaluate changes (+/-) in park attendance during and after the installation, using prior year data as a control.","While there are a variety of venues and programming entities in DTLA that offer free entertainment as well as a few small green spaces, Grand Park is uniquely positioned as the only inner city green space that combines full access to its public space with year-round free public programs. This makes the investment in elements that can support year-round enjoyable multi-generational usage all the more essential. The Grand Park approach to supporting usage of its green spaces and attendance at programs is grassroots, building programs around collaboration and partnership in order to reach and serve diverse and disparate communities. The shading project will benefit from this expertise as the park team will work one-on-one with organizations to connect with and grow the audiences who will be most directly served by the shade enhancements. Programming outreach will be extended to work more deeply with parenting communities and organizations that work with aging population in order to make them aware that more protected spaces have been developed in the park. Grand Park will also seek out programming collaborations with organizations such as the Ketchum YMCA to bring increased health and fitness activities.","In keeping with Grand Park’s commitment to Los Angeles based artists a maximum of $15,000 will be allocated to commission a local artist to design the graphic elements of the shade sails. The graphics will be inspired by two existing elements currently present in Grand Park: the “play” signage in the playground and “Park For Everyone” totems located at each cross street. These both include translations of the texts into 26 languages that reflects the inclusive and welcoming nature of Grand Park.","While all of Grand Park would benefit from shading, the LA2050 grant will be used to pilot the very first area. This pilot will cost $100,000.","Artist Commission: $15,000
 Construction: $72,000
 Permits: $8,000
 Contingency: $5,000
 Total: $100,000
 This budget does not include Grand Park administrative staff salaries for time spent on the project. All staff time will be fully funded by Grand Park/The Music Center.","Based on usage and community feedback, Grand Park will assess the degree of positive impact that shading pilot has had. The project can be scaled up by creating other artistic shade installations in other parts of the park."

Its board of directors comprise the conflicted stakeholders in urban development. The incubator is a modified startup launch process to power-up new restaurants vetted by a criteria set by the board. It will be self-sustaining after startup costs. It will create new value to share among the stakeholders. It will evolve urban development toward equitable resolution of conflict and inclusion.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Highland Park,00PlayLive,"Los Angeles faces major challenges as well as opportunities to evolve into a more equitable and sustainable city. In particular, with a new mobility plan in the City of Los Angeles and transit expansion underway countywide, there is an opportunity to create more equitable places through democratic and community-based planning for active transportation, transit, and more sustainable living patterns. Like many advocates, we see the need for changes in policy, plans and the built environment. But at this point in time, the change that it perhaps most needed is increased openness to change itself-tied to more democratic and creative ways to engage residents in planning, particularly low-income, communities of color that have traditionally been locked out of decision making processes. 
 
 The project will build on the Community Alternative 7 (CA7) as a case study of how residents are democratizing planning. A coalition of environmental justice organizations based in communities impacted by pollution from goods movement in that corridor organized to create their own serious alternative to this huge infrastructure plan. Our project will support advocacy for CA7 and we will host a training by CA7 advocates for residents interested in helping shape the future of transportation in their own areas.
 The project will identify and engage residents impacted by existing or proposed freeways and transit projects, using training workshops such as the Place It! workshops that facilitate residents expressing their experience how planning and design shape how we live, and to translate their dreams and ideas into physical forms. By conducting workshops, particularly small scale workshops focused on involving youth, women, and low income residents, the project will inspire more residents to support changes to their neighborhoods and to Los Angeles. 
 The project will simultaneously identify case studies of transformative city change linked to mobility to recommend policy and planning reforms that can make it easier for the City of Los Angeles to evolve. We will identify examples of activism on mobility from the Los Angeles region as well as how other cities have changed through shifts in mobility. We will showcase these on a website and in an exhibition. We will examine key procedures in the City Charter, general plan etc. that could be modified to open up more space for creative, democratic planning and the evolution of LA into a more sustainable, equitable city.","There is widespread suspicion of development, change, and planning processes- some of it warranted due to past redevelopment, displacement, sprawl, and lack of transparency- and decision making have evolved to bake suspicion, delay and a lack of transformative thinking into land use and other processes. Our strategy for overcoming this suspicion is to link the need for more democratic and creative planning with structural reforms to allow positive community initiated or supported projects to move forward and catalyze wider change.","- number of participants in workshops

Investing in Place works on transportation funding and equity. Alliance for Community Transit (ACT-LA) focuses on transit and equity. Several local coalitions work on street changing initiatives and regional environmental justice movement advocate around pollution from freight and freeways.

Community support is critical to the project’s long term success. Our strategy for overcoming this barrier is to continue to increase our profile and expand our network by sharing the evaluation results and lessons learned with community members, CBOs, government officials, and public as well as private stakeholders. We want to show that the project produces tangible results in decreasing violence among youth and the community and consequently has a significant impact on how youth in 2050 interact with each other, their community, and the world.","Jenesse Center’s structured evaluation system consists of a paper-and-pencil pre-learning survey composed of a hybrid of standardized instruments that utilizes the original lines of questioning developed by CCRN to ascertain youths’ perceptions about violence, bullying, dating/partner violence, and violence in the home before participating in the violence prevention education workshops. To date, approximately 641 Los Angeles area youth have completed the survey. Following the workshops, Jenesse distributes a post-learning survey that captures youths’ perceptions of violence and measures their developing understanding of the material. This evaluation system provides accurate statistical evidence and data that our program is achieving desired outcomes in equipping youth with the knowledge, skills, and awareness to address violence in their everyday lives.","While other organizations in Los Angeles that work with at-risk youth, Jenesse Center was the only organization in California to be awarded a grant in 2013 by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women, to do prevention work with youth around issues of domestic violence and healthy relationships because we are uniquely situated to reframe conversations and strategies around violence. Not only does the majority of our staff live in this community, and understand its complexities and challenges, but the relationships that we have built over the last 35 years allows us to pool resources in South Los Angeles to provide significant, meaningful, and culturally relevant programs and services that have the potential to transform entire communities.","Jenesse has a track record of successful collaboration that speaks volumes about the organization’s ability to motivate and maintain strong partnerships. CCRN has shown great success at Locke and Jordan High Schools. For the purposes of this grant, we will continue to collaborate with our (CCRN) Memorandum of Understanding Partners which include: Watts Healthcare Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools (Locke and Jordan High Schools), South Central Training Consortium, and the Los Angeles Police Department. Funds from LA2050 will not be used to fund the CCRN collaborative partners.","The existing program has a yearly budget of $300,000; Jenesse will seek funding from government grants, foundations, corporations and private individuals to cover the additional costs of the program. Funding from LA2050 would be used to sustain and expand existing curriculum-based workshops being implemented by the CCRN.

Before implementing our current workshops, we administered a Youth and Partner Perception Survey to ascertain the need. The survey results were analyzed and interpreted by independent contractors Gary Bess Associates and confirmed that violence is a prevailing problem for the Los Angeles youth surveyed. We also plan to administer a new survey to existing participants to show the effectiveness of the workshop and identify areas for improvement. Gary Bess Associates will continue to evaluate all data and track program outcomes. Jenesse has already successfully implemented this model. In year 2 of the program we reached over 3,000 South Los Angeles youth, over 500 parents, and more than 100 service providers in 6 months through our violence prevention, intervention and outreach services. It is our intention to use the second survey results as a blue print to enhance and expand existing services, resources and technical assistance to at least 3,000 more youth, parents and partners.

California has historically drawn some of the largest numbers of immigrants of any state in the nation and most recently (and particularly since “The Surge” at the border last summer) the highest number of school aged immigrant and refugee children. Unfortunately, as we all witnessed on the news and in the media, their reception has not been the kindest in many places. Sadly because of the stigmas and the stereotypes associated with this population, they are often dismissed as if somehow these children are less worthy of an eduction and come somehow predisposed to be cheap manual labor. There are many institutional reasons why we know this to be true, but as with anything at Casa Libre, we choose to address what is in our control, which we have found to be the value, or in this case, lack of value, placed on education over employment in many of our immigrant communities. We want to put an end to the vicious cycle that this disregard for education creates, not only for individuals, but for the entire City of Los Angeles. When education is undervalued, students underperform. When students underperform, schools lose funding. And when schools lose funding, our communities suffer at every level, whether it be socially, economically, environmentally, health related or otherwise. Our study hall we will provide a safe space and access to technology for kids that sometimes live in one bedroom apartments with up to six people. Here they will be able to feel their educational endeavors validated and have their confidence boosted so that higher education becomes a tangible possibility where it may have been only a dream or worse still, a source of shame. For new students, we will provide an environment of full immersion, sensitive to all the cultural and linguistic nuances associated with these students, but which will empower them learn a new language with ease. 
 Our proposal for something as seemingly basic as a study hall may not seem like much of a solution for a problem as systemic and engrained as the one we intend to take on (and do so with our current students everyday), but the simplest solution is usually the right one, no?","The main barrier we sees is overcoming is the stigma associated with study halls and the lack of value paced on education in many of our immigrant communities. In an effort to combat this, we will also be conducting family nights to inform and educate the parents and relatives. We will also build of oof pus existing partnerships with LAUSD, USC and UCLA.","Our work will be evaluated on a monthly basis based on number of participants, participation retention, GPA, presentations, hours logged, community involvement (volunteres) and Social Media results.","As far as we know, there are other organizations that provide safe places for students to do homework. Hoewever, what is unique about our approach is that we intend to provide this safe, serene and empowering environment and network of mentors, but that we are also going to tackle the undervaluation of education in our communities, particularly our immigrant communities in Westlake to help put an end to many social ills that stem from this lack of education.","For the past 5 years we have been diligently working around the clock in our community to empower our High school students to succeed .

 With this grant, we will provide 40 at-sea programs for middle schools who cannot afford to pay and are already on our waiting list, and ""free"" community programs (Sail LA!) where Angelenos can sail with their families and become part of a real working crew.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,ALL,"Our “learning by doing” programs have been operating on the L.A. Waterfront for 23 years. Our proven ability to reach students in new and compelling ways, coupled with a vibrant educational venue (tall ships at sea), is groundbreaking. Our unique program improves students’ ability and interest in continuing their education, particularly in S.T.E.M. subjects, while opening doors of opportunity for maritime careers and vocational training. Our program combines academics, recreation, real world relevance, and fosters lifelong relationships resulting in a win for students, their parents, and ultimately our community. 
 
 Our tall ships provide a challenging and nurturing environment for youth to overcome perceived physical, mental, and emotional limitations. It is very effective with adolescents who are not coping well with the demands of society and are at risk of dropping out of school. Such youths often see themselves as being incapable of living in harmony with mainstream society. 
 
 Adventure education at sea enhances the growth of developing skills such as awareness, communication, and teamwork. Our programs offer real life experience in critical thinking, self-reliance, and the pure enjoyment of being on the water. 
 
 Recent studies show children are spending less time outdoors and are averaging 50 hours of screen time each week. This sedentary behavior contributes to obesity and health problems such as type II diabetes. Movement not only improves our physical health, but also gives a significant boost to our learning abilities. As brain scientist John Medina explains, exercise improves cognition by increasing oxygen flow into the brain. According to Medina, an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness. 
 
 In addition to overall health benefits and inspiring youth to stay in school, the TopSail Youth Program has been directly credited with improving self-esteem, creating responsible behavior, developing problem solving skills, fostering ocean literacy, and inspiring maritime careers and marine science fields of study. 
 
 Traditional teaching styles tend to be less effective at reaching at-risk youth populations. Student boredom is a deterrent to learning. Research confirms that students learn most effectively from active engagement with information and ideas. Students learn better when they take the initiative to apply concepts to practice, to solve real problems, to make decisions, and to reflect on the consequences.","Bus transportation is the biggest challenge for getting students to our dock. If we can cover the cost of program sails for schools in low-income communities, they have a better chance of securing the bus funds. We are already addressing the bus transportation challenge through crowdfunding campaigns we set up for schools using our social media outlets. We currently have several campaigns running.","Students who participate in our program have the opportunity to join our volunteer Youth Crew to continue their skill building. Youth receive a Sail Training Logbook to track new skills and advance through three levels of maritime competencies. This Logbook is designed to inform, guide, and document their progress. This critical self-evaluation tool allows students to set goals, monitor their own progress, receive feedback, and achieve certification by the ship’s captain. This certification process is recognized by the United States Coast Guard and counts as necessary coursework and required sea time. For the public sailing events, we will ask participants to complete a short pre- and post- survey to measure the effectiveness of adventure learning for families, and track awareness of our local marine environment.","Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work but none in Los Angeles. We are the only organization in all of Southern California who provides this type of comprehensive at-sea program to middle school and high school students. 
 
 What sets us apart is the degree of hands-on involvement that we're able to offer students. The optimum program takes the same group of students from walking onto the dock with no experience to taking charge of all aspects of boat operation during a multi-day voyage. Some of the students who sail with us have never seen the ocean! 
 
 Our volunteers represent diverse backgrounds and cover a wide age range. This allows students to successfully interact with people that they might night otherwise have an opportunity to connect with or learn from. Such positive interaction will serve them later in life and teach youth how to develop meaningful relationships and lifelong bonds. 
 
 Our at-sea programs and our ships impact uncounted numbers of people through the schools and diverse groups who participate in TopSail; plus our volunteer ‘family’ of supporters; and the vast public who are fascinated by tall ships’ adventure education and exploration. 
 
 Our tall ships - the Irving Johnson and Exy Johnson - were built on the L.A. Waterfront between 2000 and 2002. The boats were named after sail training pioneers who sailed around the world seven times with young crews. 
 
 At their launch, they were proclaimed the Official Tall Ships and Maritime Ambassadors of the City of Los Angeles. They are USCG Sailing School Vessels and the only twin brigantines in the world. 
 
 We offer the unique educational synergy of a sailing ship -- a ‘tradition with a future’ and a value added key to the success of making LA the Best Place to Learn.",We collaborate with LAUSD Beyond the Bell and Office of Outdoor and Environmental Education.

All of Us seeks to use dialogue to encourage the community to prioritize mental health and understand its entwined relationship with physical well-being.
 The Conference organized by All of Us will attempt to attack the stigma surrounding mental health and educate individuals about the resources available to combat mental health issues by hosting workshops, providing opportunities to interact with representatives of mental health resources and inspirational keynote speakers, and offering a platform to voice one’s opinions and challenge one’s own beliefs.

 Mental health issues and psychological disorders are often characterized by biological underpinnings as well as physical and social manifestations that people are generally unaware of. More importantly, there is a distinguishable discrepancy between the clinical and social realities of mental illnesses, resulting in a multitude of myths, false beliefs and preconceived notions. All of Us aims to bridge this gap via education, advocacy and awareness, and therefore, to an extent, break the stigma. 
 Mental health is a complex, neglected and scorned issue.The objective of All of Us Conference is to address this multifaceted issue through participating minds that are willing and progressive. Sustaining a city of mentally healthy citizens requires a concerted citywide effort that our campaign seeks to promote and accomplish.","Our lives, especially in educational and professional domains, have increasingly become synonymous with stress, anxiety, eating disorders, body-image issues and disrupted sleeping patterns. This, at an obvious level, has engendered a tendency to normalize and trivialize mental health issues, which is often reflected in phrases such as “snap out of it”, “it is just a phase” and “get over it”. All of Us believes that these mental health problems signal an impending mental health crisis, and encourages people to seek help, regardless of society’s assessment of their mental health status. 
 
 Mental health is exceedingly intricate and subjective in nature, and does not always restrict itself to an objective scale for comparison. Mental health awareness, promoted by All of Us, includes educating the people of Los Angles about the numerous complexities and markers of mental illnesses, making it easier to identify mental health triggers and concerns.","We will determine the success of our project through the community’s increase in contact with mental health representatives introduced at the Conference. We will also analyze available usage data from counseling and psychological service centers to determine an increase in utilization of counseling and psychological services. This, coupled with an increase in traffic on our website, should help us evaluate the success of our Conference to a large extent.","Other organizations doing similar work include NAMI at the national level, and ‘Active Minds’ at UCLA and the ‘Mental Health Initiative’ at UCLA, at the local level.
 We're unique since we're taking a proactive approach to outreach, by engaging the work that existing mental health organizations are doing with underprivileged communities. By establishing liaisons and asking these communities to establish a safe space at the conference, we are directly encouraging these communities to begin the dialogue of mental health in their spaces. Furthermore, we are focused on statewide advocacy as well, pushing for funding towards wellness programs and critical care services for our Counseling and Psychological Services at UCLA, as well as other mental health spaces across LA.","Our main partners for this campaign include the USAC Office of the President, the Student Wellness Commission (SWC), and Active Minds at UCLA. We will also be collaborating with UCLA CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), the multidisciplinary student mental health center on the UCLA campus, to ensure that all of our messaging and programming is accurate and sensitive of the parties we hope to target with our campaign. CAPS will train all campaign members in topics pertaining to mental health through Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) Suicide Prevention Training and Mental Health First Aid training.
  
 The USAC Office of the President is responsible for presiding over the Student Body Council and provides services and resources for the UCLA student body through advocacy, education, and programming. The All of Us campaign was founded by USAC so they are extremely committed to the success of the campaign. They will provide AOU any support necessary in terms of networking, publicity, and establishing credibility.
  
 The SWC at UCLA affirms that student well-being goes hand-in-hand with both physical and psychological health as well as academic success and well-roundedness. SWC promotes the holistic well-being of the student body through weekly programming of CPR classes, health symposiums, and philanthropic and community service events such as blood drives and Run/Walk at UCLA. 
  
 Active Minds UCLA Chapter is the student voice for mental health advocacy on campus. The group provides information on resources for those that suffer from mental health issues and for those who support others who suffer. Active Minds hold workshops and events on the UCLA campus as well as programs at local elementary schools and community centers.
  
 Three factors critical to the success of collaboration are (1) we can efficiently create a structure to delegate and accomplish tasks in the most efficient manner possible with our staff of over 100 people (2) we have access to mental health professionals as a resource throughout the creation and execution of the campaign (3) the SWC’s experience in leading the successful campaign 7000 in Solidarity is vital to the programming for All of Us. All of the organizations above will collaborate and support All of Us, but the core directors and staff of AOU will be in charge of the funds to facilitate the efficient and effective execution of the All of Us conference and programs.","We have estimated that our projects costs will not exceed $100,000.","We will use $100,000 to implement this project in the following way:
 Venue: $30000-$40000
 Speaker Rooming+Traveling Expenses: $10000
 Honorarium: $10000
 Food: $7000
 Incentives: $5000
 Paper (for resource handouts): $500
 Advertising: $8000

 Miscellaneous: $13500","We will use the success of our conference to recruit more volunteers, partner with more organizations with similar objectives, to expand our 2016 conference, our campaign, and the space for dialogue that we hope to create. The bigger the space, the greater the dialogue, and the greater the dialogue, the greater will be the awareness. Hence, when it comes to the scale of our Conference, the sky is the limit.
 We will build and sustain a robust communication effort around our conference through direct marketing (at UCLA), social media and our newsletters, to keep participants engaged in our work, as well as to reach out to as many people as possible. We intend to use pictures, videos and anecdotes from our conference and the rest of our campaign endeavors to display the kind of work that we do throughout the year, and we expect a large increase in our ‘following’ on our Facebook page, Instagram, email lists and twitter this year, helping us to reach out to a larger audience.
 The success of our 2015 Conference will also help us expand our network of contacts that we can use for inviting keynote speakers, conducting workshops and collaborating with experienced organizations in 2016. This in turn will allow us to conduct larger conferences with better resources in the years forward."

5102016,Angel City Lumber,2015009,,,"Everybody loves trees while they’re standing, but In Los Angeles a felled tree immediately becomes “green waste,” garbage to be chipped or buried in city landfills. But the natural urban forest of our city overflows with usable trees which can be re-purposed into highly sought after lumber. Angel City Lumber offers a vision of Los Angeles in which trees felled in the city are given a second life in the hands of the artists, crafts people and builders of Los Angeles.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Based in Boyle Heights, Angel City Lumber will re-use trees found anywhere in Los Angeles.",Live,"Wood plays a vital role in Los Angeles’ creative landscape. From the elevated design of Disney Concert Hall’s Oak floors to the handmade Walnut mustache combs of Offerman Wood Shop - Los Angeles artists love to use quality hardwood. Fine furniture makers design and produce elegant tables, chairs and credenzas. Artists find beauty in the knots and burls of misshapen trees. And Interior designers plan for natural wood floors, decks and ceilings for their clients. Undeniably, wood plays an enormous role in the consciousness of Los Angeles creative minds.
 
 However, most hardwood lumber offered for sale in Los Angeles comes from elsewhere. Builders looking for White Oak have it trucked in from Maine. A furniture maker hired to build a Walnut credenza ends up with wood from Alabama. And most Douglas Fir flooring found in Los Angeles originated in British Columbia. This is the fundamental problem Angel City Lumber will combat. In a city where hundreds of gorgeous, usable hardwood trees are felled every month - only the smallest percentage are re-used.
 
 As soon as trees are felled in Los Angeles they are considered “green waste.” The city usually chops downed trees into two foot lengths and buries them in landfills - or at best, mulches them. We do this to more than 95% of our urban trees. 
 
 Angel City Lumber takes the fallen trees of our community and mills them into building materials, specifically dimensional lumber, wood slabs, and millworks. We use a state-of-the-art portable Lucas Mill 8-30 for cutting and we dry the wood in our Nyle L200M wood kiln for between 6-8 weeks. Finally, we offer these urban lumber products back to builders, furniture makers, artists, contractors, homeowners, architects and designers in the Los Angeles community. 
 
 We have a strong, uncomplicated vision for Los Angeles. We want to stop burying trees and instead use them to increase the supply of high quality raw materials available to city artists, while at the same time lowering prices. The resources of Los Angeles should be utilized by those living and working in Los Angeles. But beyond that, we take pride in being a small local business created to minimize waste while at the same time bolstering the creative opportunities within Los Angeles.","For our city to embrace the re-purposing of downed trees there must be a network of people on the lookout
 
 The promise of urban lumber is a powerful one. Our main strategy for introducing ourselves lies in contacting as many decision makers as possible. We are reaching out to as many arborists, tree surgeons, park managers and tree services as possible. People who work with trees are frustrated at the lack of options for them and are eager for a solution
 
 The images of what we do are powerful. Downed trees buried versus being made into a beautiful bookshelf, for example. We will have a strong social media presence seeking to spread the word of re-using Los Angeles’ urban trees.
 
 We have begun to establish partnerships. On the conservation side Tree People has been one of our early connections. Conversely, Offerman Wood Shop, and Nick Offerman himself, are equally excited. As a shop supporting independent wood workers, the promise of affordable, local wood is music to their ears","Angel City Lumber’s mission is to re-use the readily available resource of Los Angeles’ urban forest and, in so doing, provide the city with high quality, low priced hardwood lumber. By far the best way to evaluate our success lies in tracking our market share. By evaluating our sales against those of other Los Angeles lumber companies, that do not source their lumber locally, we can effectively track what impact we are having on delivering a valuable resource to the local artistic community. 
 
 We have no delusions of grandeur - we are starting small in the hopes of instigating a larger change over time. Big lumber companies and home centers’ are in no danger of suddenly seeing their sales dry up. However, by steadily increasing our market share, we hope to present a positive example of how re-using sustainable local resources can not only positively affect our bottom line, but will also aid the creative population we serve.","There are a number of companies throughout the United States practicing urban lumber, though Angel City Lumber is the first to set up shop in Los Angeles.

 Angel City Lumber has studied the success stories of these companies and intends to both mimc and improve their processes. We don’t feel the need to be particularly different from these companies, they’ve provided an excellent example of what sustainability looks like in the world of hardwood lumber.
 That being said - there are a few points which differentiate Angel City Lumber. With the exception of NY Heartwoods, the above companies primary income comes from selling premium-priced furniture constructed from urban lumber – not selling the lumber itself. Angel City Lumber will focus on selling competitively priced urban lumber to the public. 
 
 Another excellent point in our favor, Los Angeles houses a vast number of tree species. Due to our favorable climate, typical urban tree species in Los Angeles hail from all six of the inhabitable continents. We will have a more diverse inventory than any of the above companies simply by our geography.","Angel City Lumber is a partnership between Jeff Perry and Charles DeRosa. Together we formed a business to turn Los Angeles’ downed trees into affordable, high quality lumber. Our intention is to invest the full $100,000 of the grant into growing the capacity of Angel City to mill, dry and sell lumber, sourced from Los Angeles, affordably. 
 
 We do not have any other partners who will receive the grant money.","Our goal of bringing urban lumber to Los Angeles is highly scaleable. So far we have started small, spending $50,000 of our own money to buy a kiln for drying, a mill for cutting and paying monthly rent on 5000 square feet of commercial real estate to house the business. 
 
 Urban lumber will not catch on immediately - and creating a stock of useable lumber will take time. Drying three thousand board feet of even a single species will take four to six weeks.$100,000 ensures that Angel City Lumber will be given the time necessary to succeed and will also allow us to enlarge our operation more quickly. The grant money will buy an additional kiln for drying more wood and doubling our capacity, a forklift for moving trees which often weigh in excess of 5000 lbs., and help pay the rent over coming months while we create a stock of wood that covers the artistic communities’ needs.","A second Kiln to double our production $10,000
 A year of rent  $40,000
 A fork lift  $8,000
 Outreach (Business Cards,Brochures $15,000
 Website)
 Hire a part time employee  $25,000","We did not start Angel City Lumber simply to sell wood. We were seduced by the opportunity to salvage the trees of Los Angeles, otherwise doomed to be buried or chipped, and put them in the hands of artists. By using local trees and doing the work here in Los Angeles we also saw a way to lower prices - allowing artists and builders to pass on savings to their clients.
 
 Our long term plan involves scaling up production - there are thousands of usable trees coming down in Los Angeles annually, we want to salvage as many as possible. This future will require more infrastructure - vehicles with greater hauling capacity, the hiring of employees and expanding locations. 
 
 The beauty of urban lumber is the simplicity of it’s message, re-use local resources that are otherwise being wasted. It is also a sound business plan, as we’ve seen with the success of urban lumber companies elsewhere. Angel City Lumber hopes to expand it’s operation - while at the same time expanding the awareness of Angelenos of the value of our local resources."

AOA will deliver 12 one-week Theatre Project residencies for adult female students currently residing in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) and for male High School Students in the Pitchess Detention Center. These programs will be delivered by professional instructor and a team of Ambassadors, current students and alumni from the Art of Acting Studio.
 
 How does this work on a day to day basis? Each class begins with a progression of physical exercises to stretch and tone the body; voice and speech exercises designed to open their voice, expand the breath and develop strength and clarity in speaking; learning and practicing acting technique through scene work and storytelling. In the class, students will find an opportunity to share their training experience and discoveries in an “open class” setting with invited guests.
 
 Through this work, the studio fulfills its mission of bringing world class faculty and training to those who cannot afford it, while also providing our full time tuition based students with a model for social engagement. This partnership also presents a unique opportunity to serve the mission of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) and Five Keys Charter Schools by encouraging these students to embrace new language and bold ideas. AOA aims to empower participants through the rigorous study of craft. The final “open class” environment provides a ritual for success for students as as well as a moment to reflect, to acknowledge and dream for all participants and stakeholders, as the students receive validation from the peers and the professionals they look to each and every day. 
 
 When students are released from the facility, they are invited to participate in a free, monthly, theatre re-entry program at their new artistic home - THE ART OF ACTING STUDIO. AOA will continue to nurture the growth of students both in their art and human growth as they re-enter society.","One barrier is funding. The studio’s work in jails has recently begun to receive national recognition and several funders have expressed interest in our programs. We are confidant that the full scope of our work can be funded within the coming year.
 
 Another barrier is access to the facility and to inmates. However, Director of Outreach Tommy Demenkoff has a track record of proven success with these sensitive partnerships. We are confidant that we have the team, diplomacy and experience to continue to navigate the nuances of jails, prisons and detention centers with success.
 
 Another potential barrier is simply the day-to-day realities of working with these populations: unexpected facility lock-downs, dangerous conditions, etc. all could potentially disrupt the work. This is something our team has come to anticipate and respond to with flexibility.","Based on previous program delivery, the studio recommends evaluation based on 1) attendance 2) participation (in theatre class, for example, did the student write and/or perform during the course of the session) and 3) participation in re-entry program. Student feedback in narrative form is an essential aspect of program evaluation as is feedback from each facility's staff including corrections officers, wardens and program staff.","On the local and national spectrum, AOA's approach is utterly unique. First, we work primarily in jails. The distinction between jails and prisons is key. Jail is where inmates are held either while they are waiting to be sentenced OR where they are held for a term less than 365 days. Therefore this population is highly transitory and therefore difficult to serve as participants are constantly entering and leaving a program mid-course. To serve this population effectively a service organization must be sensitive to the nuances of the population. This is a challenge that many organizations are not able to apply their work to. However, AOA’s theatre classes are designed with this in mind. The course is structured so that consistently attending students can build on skills from one session to the next and experience progress in the acquisition of craft while new students are able to jump in mid-term and make a meaningful contribution.
  
 Furthermore, the theater curriculum is designed to pass forward and invite participation in a great American tradition (i.e. the tradition of the Yiddish Theater, Group Theater, and Stella Adler’s contribution to the American theatre) WHILE AT THE SAME TIME inviting students to express what is important to them now by writing new short plays and monologues. The combination of actor training with writing helps to personalize the participant's experience. In other words, we share an excellent technique that is both world-class and professionally recognized AND then we invite participants to use the technique to write, tell and perform their own unique life experiences. This combination is unprecedented.
  
 We take inspiration from Sabra Wiliams' work at the Actors’ Gang Prison Project which brings commedia dell'arte to California prisons. However, our approach is quite different. First, we work primarily in jails while Actors’ Gang works primarily in prisons. Prison is where inmates stay once they have been sentenced; this is therefore a less transitory population. Actors’ Gang work also focuses exclusively on training in the classical commedia dell'arte form, a highly physical technique that is often accessible across social strata with little background in theater. We look to Actors’ Gang Prison program as an excellent model, but a model from which we differ significantly when viewed with understanding of program particulars.","Five Keys Charter Schools

 AOA has funded pilots of the work at both Twin Towers and Pitchess.

 Since launching our work in jails in March 2014 we have consistently expanded the population of inmates served. We began exclusively serving adolescents at Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York City. Over the course of one year we expanded our service to include male and female adult populations including high security populations. We have also expanded geographically. First we branched out to serve multiple facilities at Rikers and in June 2015, based on the success of our previous work, we received an invitation to provide a program at Twin Towers in Los Angeles. The relationships required for the successful delivery of this kind of program are key; once we engage successfully with a partner we are committed to a long-term relationship. 
 
 Furthermore, sustainability is an important part of delivering a program in jail successfully. First, students must see that you are there consistently in order for them to believe that you are truly invested in their growth and well-being. Establishing trust is vital to a jail service program. Second, sustainability is also important to measuring the success of the program. A minimum of a year-long presence in jail is ideal to obtain the necessary evaluation and data materials and to continue to define excellent work with our community partners. The more time we spend in a location the more accessible it becomes to potential stakeholders. In short, we are in this for the long haul!"

We believe the best method for mobility within the Westside is by cycling, skateboarding, walking and running, this provides a long term solution to the traffic problem in Los Angeles. LA has the ability to be just as bike friendly as our Euro neighbors or other West Coast City neighbors, however we need infrastructure to allow this to happen safely. Awareness is growing through cycLAvia and there is a growing community of people who commute via bike, but a long term solution is needed for the Westside and this proposal facilitates the development of a vast network of bike/ped paths that connect north and south as well as east and west. Currently a north south route does not exist on the west side across Ballona creek except for at the Beach path. 
 
 Our proposal will allow people, students, to move freely and commute safely. Currently there is not a safe method for Venice High students who live in Westchester to cycle to school since there is not easy access or bike path across Ballona Creek. Lincoln Blvd bridge is very dangerous and Centinela is equally as dangerous.

The best location includes a peninsula which could be used as an interpretive park and is on axis with Marina 90 Fwy, since it is an abandoned CSX railway line, it has existing bridge abutments which can be rehabilitated and used to support a new bike/pedestrian bridge. There is an opportunity to connect into Marvin Braude Bike path in Marina Del Rey if the bridge is oriented along the 90 Fwy on CSX railway. This also allows for a connection to Westchester and Inglewood through a future bike path along the Centinela Creek waterway. A new connection is proposed into Playa Vista Park and Westchester neighborhood through Loyola Marymount University.","Work will be evaluated by completion of the bridge and the resultant of additional bike/pedestrian friendly and safe paths on the Westside. We hope this project will catalyze future development of Bike/Pedestrian friendly paths. This will provide increased access to Healthy life styles, recreation and mobility between communities. We will provide increased access to the beach from communities that currently do not have safe access. We also will provide access to new grocery stores being built in Playa Vista. We suspect there is an Food Desert in the area we are working since there are so few grocery stores. Providing access over Ballona Creek will only further alleviate these conditions and provide access for the community to healthy lifestyles.","We propose teaming up with North East Trees a non-profit who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development. They have done similar projects across the region and will provide invaluable experience to deliver the project.
 
 We propose teaming up with anyone who is interested in the project and who can allocate resources or people to further developing the project. The more support we can obtain from local organizations and community the higher chance of success the project will have.
 
 THarchitecture and North East Trees will work with the community to perform, community workshops, a feasibility study and initial design concepts for the Connector Bridge. We have previous experience with public works projects and also have consulting engineers who will help engineer the project and work with county engineers and local regulatory agencies to deliver a successful project.","We have visited the site with North East Trees northeasttrees.org a non-profit organization who has a critical role in the development of the Glendale River Narrows path development and other bike/pedestrian friendly paths around LA and LA County. As an organization they see immense potential in the project and are interested in working with THarchitecture to make this project a reality. We propose a 50K for North East trees to dedicate one full time employee and 50K for THarchitecture to dedicate one full time employee to the project for the next two years, until the project has catalyzed enough for other methods of Grant funding/Private funding.
 
 We will work with other Ballona Creek organizations and Bicycle advocacy Groups:
 
 ballonafriends.org, ballonarenaissance.org, ballonawetlands.org, ballonarestoration.org, labike.org, CCbike.org (culver city cyclists). Bike LMU, SMspoke.org (santa monica cyclists)","Additional cost will be covered by applying for Grants for which the Connector Ped/Bike Brige is a prime candidate, such as Proposition 50- River Parkways Grant program, we will submit for this grant in 2016. We will need additional resources and funding to make this a successful grant application. 
 
 Other sources of Funding: 
  Los Angeles County - Proposition A Grant
 Caltrans - Dept. of Transportation - Environmental Enhancement and Mitigation program
 LACity Funding
 LACounty Funding
  
 We recognize there is a wealth of financial capital within the tech community in Playa Vista, Venice and Santa Monica (aka Silicon Beach) we believe there can be enormous financial support for this project from one or many of these major tech companies. We will need additional resources and funding to seek the support of these companies.","As the project is in the infant stage, we need organizers behind the project to garner community support, local governmental support and corporate support for the project. Funding and Resources will be required to run community workshops as well as research and identify funding sources. We feel this project could reach fruition and become a reality faster if there are people who are dedicated full time to the project. THarchitecture proposes to donate all partner and principal time to the project as much is financially possible, however we need capital to allocate resources to the project for a full time employee for the next two years. 
 
 We propose North East Trees will use a similar approach to the project and will need capital to dedicate a full time person to the project for the next two years. As they are busy with many other projects, we will need the additional funding to allow this project to be a priority, within their scope of projects.","Success will be determined by the number of people who will use the Connector Ped/Bike bridge in the future once it is completed. We feel it is not a matter of ""If"" a bridge will be provided it is ""When"" and we hope this proposal will accelerate that time period. Providing a safe way to cross Ballona Creek will increase the amount of Pedestrian and Bike Traffic moving between communities. Safe routes which prevent accidents between pedestrians, bikes and cars and save lives will have success which cannot be scaled. The ability to safely bicycle our kids from Culver City, Mar Vista to Ballona Creek Wetlands Ecological Reserve and other Playa Vista parks will also be a measure of success."
5102243,Basketball Courts and Public Art: Inspiring Inter-generational Play in Public Parks,2015159,,,"Public park basketball courts are the “heart-beat” of many communities. Leveraging the energy and creativity created by outdoor basketball, Project Backboard will coordinate with local and national partners to renovate 15 basketball courts in LA, commission and install public art, made by community members and working artists, around each court, host free all-ages basketball tournaments, cleaning up graffiti and install outdoor fitness equipment where appropriate.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,00PlayLive,"Basketball is the most popular recreational sport in the United States across all ages and genders. The balance of individual contribution and potential for group excellence makes basketball a game that is easily shared with friends, family, neighbors and strangers. 
 
 Project Backboard believes that improving basketball court facilities and installing artwork in public parks encourages greater park usage by all ages and genders. Increased park usage generated by facility renovation has the potential to impact park safety and build stronger communities through increasing social interaction between different groups. 
 
 Project Backboard's prior initiative in Memphis resulted in 18 renovated basketball courts and 37 individual works of art, created by community members and working artists, including graphic backboards, on court murals, tile mosaics and kinetic sculptures. 
 
 Installing artwork on and around basketball courts brings creative thinking into the heart of communities and inspires people to imagine a future outside of their current circumstances. Individually designed courts in each neighborhood also creates a sense of ownership and community pride which helps ensure that courts won’t be further marred with graffiti or trash and makes parks safer. 
 
 Los Angeles has a rich history of outdoor basketball and a number of successful college and professional athletes have developed their game on LA's public outdoor courts. While Los Angeles has some great outdoor courts, it also has a number of courts which could be improved through community engagement and art enhancements. Working with a variety of partners and stakeholders our goal is to pilot a park enhancement in the next year with the goal of ultimately completing at least 15 park projects and setting up a trustees organization for public basketball courts. 
 
 Once courts are completed and public artwork is installed, parks will be activated with a free Full-Court 21 basketball tournament, including live music and a community block party. Full-Court 21 allows all ages and genders to participate without requiring teammates. 
 
 Los Angeles can be a better place to play and the success of Project Backboard's efforts in Memphis will easily to a city that loves basketball and has weather suitable to outdoor basketball all year long.","Given the public nature of the places where I plan to work, partnerships with the city government and parks and recreation department will be essential to the Project Backboard initiative. Working on public property requires additional considerations no present when working on private property. Given the public nature of the places where I plan to work, partnerships with the city government and parks and recreation department will be essential to the Project Backboard initiative. Having worked closely with the Parks and Neighborhoods Division in Memphis I not only understand the considerations at play but also have been connected with the relevant government departments in Los Angeles and I am confident, especially given the number of park improvement projects the City of Los Angeles has championed in recent years, that the necessity of working through red tape and city officials will make Project Backboard more accountable to the public and more sustainable long term.","The first step in this process is visiting and photographing all the public outdoor basketball courts in the city and assigning a numeric value to the condition of each court, including grading the surroundings, rims, backboards, lines, etc. From their courts will be selected based on proximity to local partners, strength of stakeholders groups and the needs of the court. Completed courts will be evaluated by tracking usage over time, depth of local engagement, number of volunteers and participants in basketball tournaments.","Though basketball is the most popular recreational sport in America and many youth development organizations exists to teach “life skills” through the use of basketball and other sports, there are no other organizations which use basketball courts as a canvas to introduce art into communities and individual who might not otherwise access works of art as part of their daily lives. Bringing two creative endeavors, pick-up basketball and public art, together has a powerful impact on athletes and observers and encourage people to imagine a future beyond their current circumstances.","Individual local partners have not been selected yet, but typically partners are engaged on a volunteer basis and costs are limited to items like water and snacks for volunteers and other minor expenses.",As Project Backboard's involvement in Los Angeles expands beyond the 15 initial courts additional funding will come from private donors and corporate sponsors.,"Depending on the condition of each court renovations can cost between $500 and $4,000. Similarly, past art projects have ranged from $200 to $7,500. Each of the 15 courts, once selected, will dictate the level of investment and costs involved. Activating each park with a basketball tournament will costs a additional $500-$1000 per tournament.","Scale-ability is at the heart of Project Backboard and having complete 18 courts in Memphis, I know that the momentum and excitement generated in one location builds on the next. The benefit of working on highly visible projects in multiple locations is that the community, especially the basketball and art communities, begin to become aware of the project and will often reach out with support and ideas. Our experience working closely with the Memphis Grizzlies will also help build relationships with local professional sports organizations, involving them in future court projects."
5102043,Be a Voice for LAs Foster Care Children!,2018014,,,"The 30,000 children under the care of the Dependency Court in L.A. County are frightened and confused, and in desperate need of support and advocacy services - a need that trained volunteers fill by building a relationship with a child in foster care, and working with the Court to determine the best strategies to support him or her. CASA/LA will recruit 550 more volunteers by the end of 2017 to help these children navigate the trials of the courtroom - and the trials of a challenged childhood.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,CASA of Los Angeles helps children in foster care from everywhere in Los Angeles County.,Learn,"Nelson Mandela once said, ""There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children."" For LA's abused and neglected children, LA's soul is revealed to be diverse, hopeful, challenged, determined, and sadly, in desperate need of connection. CASA/LA creates a connection between an adult volunteer and a neglected child that transforms the volunteer’s life as much as it changes the child’s. CASA of Los Angeles unites these multiple generations, responding to the needs of our community’s most vulnerable children with the knowledge of our city’s most brilliant, compassionate, and committed adults.
 
 Being a CASA is unlike any other volunteer opportunity in the city. CASAs become a critical part of the foster care youth's life - they get to know their families and caregivers, they work with their teachers and counselors, they connect them to services and advocate for what they need in the courtroom, and they create a stable, long-term relationship with the child without ever being paid to do so.
 
 Every child faces challenges in life. From homework to bullies, from fights with their siblings to issues with their parents, but for children in foster care, every single one of those problems is magnified, overwhelming children who already struggle with resiliency. They are alone and afraid. They have often been removed from a traumatic home life only to be transferred to a strange placement with strange people, having to negotiate not only the social rules of a new school, but a whole new family, adults and children alike. 
 
 It is not surprising that children in foster care experience the following distressing consequences:
 • 85% of foster youth live with serious mental health challenges 
 • 37% will not finish high school 
 • 33% of girls in foster care became pregnant by age 17 
 • 27% of the homeless population spent time in foster care 
 • 25% of youth aging out of foster care will be incarcerated within two years
 
 There is no more critical cause through which Angelenos can connect than its most vulnerable children - children who have no voice. Through LA2050, CASA will recruit and train 250 new volunteers in FY2016, and 300 new volunteers in FY2017, a significant increase over any previous year. In the next few years, CASA plans to serve 10% of the 30,000 children in the foster care system. By connecting Angelenos, we can make that goal happen, revealing the compassion and commitment that is Los Angeles.","The biggest barrier to recruiting more volunteers is the lack of awareness in the Los Angeles community about CASA of Los Angeles and the critical services that our volunteer advocates provide. Through increased exposure, CASA/LA can introduce more people to this life-changing work and can recruit more volunteers to advocate on behalf of abused and neglected youth in the foster care system, many of whom are struggling with some of the largest issues of our day: human trafficking, sexual exploitation, mental health and educational delays, and more. When someone becomes a CASA volunteer, they are not only addressing the challenges of the foster care system, they are addressing a number of issues affecting our community. We believe that through the support of LA 2050, we can create a new idea of what it means to be a volunteer. The CASA program offers its volunteers the opportunity to become conduits for change in the lives of abused and neglected children throughout our community.","CASA/LA currently tracks all key data elements, i.e. how many children we serve, how many CASAs are serving said youth, the number of children on our waitlist, and how many more CASA volunteers are needed to serve that waitlist. In addition, we also track case progress. When a case is assigned, both the Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer will examine the case and will rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and wellbeing. We will be documenting in the database the initial assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency, and wellbeing measures changes over time. The overall goal of CASA/LA’s evaluation plan is to determine if inputs are leading to effective outcomes.","CASA of Los Angeles is the only organization in Los Angeles providing court-appointed advocates to foster care youth. Though we will work with other organizations on recruitment efforts, CASA/LA is unique in that we recruit and train volunteers from all across Los Angeles to serve as mentors, guides, and as a voice for the child who cannot speak up for him or herself. As a result, foster children paired with a CASA spend fewer years in foster care, are more likely to be adopted, and have a better chance of achieving greater academic success.","CASA/LA’s current partnerships include numerous organizations advocating for the wellbeing of underserved youth throughout Los Angeles County and beyond, such as The Right Way Foundation, Zero to Three, Project ABC, L.A. Child Guidance Center, Child Development Institute, Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services, Secure Transitions Foster Family Agency, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, among others. In addition, of Los Angeles regularly partners with like-minded organizations and governmental agencies to serve—and save—more children in the dependency courts, including:
 
 • Los Angeles Dependency Court
 • The Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services
 • Children's Law Center
 • The Alliance for Children's Rights
 • Child Development Institute
 • Los Angeles Department of Mental Health
 • Los Angeles Department of Public Health
 
 However, through LA2050, CASA/LA hopes to expand its partnerships to include groups which work with specific diverse populations, like First African Methodist Episcopal Church (FAME), the Los Angeles Latino Chamber of Congress (LALCC), the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), Brotherhood Crusade, and 100 Black Men of Los Angeles.

We will place students into summer internships with LA biotech companies to give them valuable hands-on work experience. Students will also attend an entrepreneurship academy that introduces them to the opportunities and pathways of creating a biotech startup.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"LA Bioscience Hub (LABH) will help make LA the best place to create by fostering the next generation of diverse biotech entrepreneurs in our region. 
 
 Biotech is an industry of the future. It steadily expanded in LA County during the recession and continues to outpace many sectors in job growth today. Careers in the bioscience industry tend to pay family-supporting wages, providing an opportunity for low-income communities of color to enter the middle class. Given the sector’s strength in our region, LABH wants to ensure that this industry reflects the diversity and dynamism of Los Angeles. To help achieve this vision and make LA the best place to create, we are launching the Biotech Leaders Academy.
 
 The Biotech Leaders Academy has two key components: (1) an entrepreneurship academy and (2) providing students with paid internships at local biotech firms. 
 
 The entrepreneurship academy will expose students from diverse backgrounds to the spectrum of career pathways available to them after they’ve completed their education. Our academy will equip students with the tools they’ll need to begin a career in biotechnology and empower them to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Through the Biotech Leaders Academy, we will cultivate our region’s next generation of local bioscience company founders, CEOs, COOs, and CTOs. We’ll foster entrepreneurship through learning modules that cover a variety of topics, including tech transfer, moving research from the lab to commercialization, securing capital, and building a team for success. Students will meet local entrepreneurs and get connected to local resources to ensure their success here in LA. 
 
 The second component of the Biotech Leaders Academy is our summer internship placement program. LABH will connect students to paid industry internships that provide hands-on work experience in this competitive field. The internship component will be modeled after work study programs, with LABH and participating biotech companies funding student internships jointly. This will ensure meaningful industry engagement and enable a broad spectrum of firms – from first stage startups to major industry leaders – to participate. 
 
 The Biotech Leaders Academy will nurture and expand our region’s entrepreneurial and innovation economy. By creating opportunities for populations that are underrepresented in the biotech industry, we will develop a more inclusive local economy and we will help make LA the best place to create.","We do not foresee any barriers to the successful implementation of Biotech Leaders Academy. However, we do anticipate the need to accommodate students’ schedules, transportation access, and unique circumstances. We hope that by keeping all of our programming during normal business hours on weekdays, students will be able to fully participate in the program while still tending to outside commitments and responsibilities. To ensure that students are able to reach their internship sites and the entrepreneurship courses, we will work with students and employers to identify opportunities for work schedule adjustments, carpool, and public transit. 
 
 Another challenge we anticipate will be greater demand from students than what can be accommodated with the project budget. We will work to make the program available for as many students as possible without sacrificing quality of the curriculum, company placements, and level of compensation.","Biotech Leaders Academy aims to 1) introduce students to biotech entrepreneurship and inspire them to start their own companies; 2) create meaningful, long-term partnerships between academic institutions and local biotech companies. 
 
 To measure our success based on the following:
 - Number of students participating in the program and number of student applicants
 - Students’ comfort with the basics skills and areas of entrepreneurship
 - Employer satisfaction with program
 - Percent of employers that are interested in providing internships for future cohorts
 - Percent of internship positions that are extended into the school year
 - Percent of interns that are invited for additional opportunities with their summer employer
 - Number of students who go on to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors
 
 We will the program's survey students, employers, and instructors before, during, and after the program. In addition, we will gather feedback through group and one-on-one discussions.","While there are several entrepreneurship programs available for young adults, there are none that focus on the bioscience industry and target students of color. Biotech is a unique field in which to create a company and entrepreneurship in this industry looks very different from other sectors. Our program recognizes this and provides a specialized set of modules that address the industry-specific challenges and aim to inspire and prepare students to create companies that address some of our world’s most pressing health issues. 
 
 Our internship placement program is also unique in the perspective and opportunity it provides students. Currently our collaborator, the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program at East Los Angeles College (ELAC) places an average of 30 students into summer research internships with academic and research institutions across LA. These research internships provide exposure to bioscience in an academic setting. The key difference between MESA’s existing program and Biotech Leaders Academy is that our program will provide students the opportunity to intern and connect with the biotech industry where they can work on biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and therapeutics in a start-up or entrepreneurial environment. Students are eager to have these opportunities and the industry has a growing interest in leveraging their funds to hire ELAC students for summer internships.","LA Bioscience Hub’s key collaborator will be East Los Angeles College (ELAC). We will work closely with its Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program. MESA is dedicated to increasing the number of students from disadvantaged communities that pursue and earn graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Students in MESA are our target students for Biotech Leaders Academy. ELAC will receive approximately $11,000 for their role in implementing Biotech Leaders Academy and helping to make it a successful program. One of the key roles for ELAC will be MESA’s student recruitment and selection of students for our program. As part of this process, ELAC will prepare the selected students with two orientations and one session on ethics in research (Responsible Conduct of Research). At the end of the summer, ELAC will also host a poster-session style event, during which students can showcase the work and lessons they’ve learned during their summer. Lastly, ELAC will also be the site of the entrepreneurship classes that take place throughout the students’ summer.","Biotech Leaders Academy can be launched and fully executed with $100,000.","LA Bioscience Hub Internship Match for 20 students (50% match): $52,000

 - Establish stronger partnerships with academic institutions, particularly those with programs dedicated to increasing diversity in STEM, so that more students can connect with industry leaders and internships, and gain valuable biotech entrepreneurship skills. 
 
 - Since we will have an established curriculum for the entrepreneurship academy, we can provide it to colleges and universities that are interested in expanding the program to their campus. 
 
 - We will continue to grow our network of industry partners and foster stronger ties between the colleges and the private sector. Additionally, we will work with industry partners to create opportunities for longer-term internships.
 
 - We will create a more formal network of mentors that is comprised of industry leaders and professionals who host student interns, present during the entrepreneurship academy, or are generally interested in assisting students as they advance in their education.
 
 - Seek additional funding sources to support the internship match and course component."
5102029,BlacklistLA Moves Toward The Future,2016021,,,"Every Monday night at 10:00 PM, hundreds of Angelenos gather for a 3-mile run through the streets of LA. The location of the run varies; what remains the same is a diverse group of runners sharing their fitness goals, appreciating the unsung beauty of our city’s street art, and developing a deeper connection to each other and our neighborhoods. 
 
 This proposal aims to turn the powerful connecting force of the BlacklistLA Monday run into a more frequent occurrence by expanding its offerings.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"All Metro Station with Park and Rides. Also, places such as Walt Disney Concert Hall, LACMA, Leimart Park, Culver City Arts District, Abbot Kinney, etc",Play,"We’ll be the first to admit that we’ve got a big crush on this city. Whether catching the sunrise in Chinatown, exploring the trails of Griffith Park, stopping at the LACMA lights for a selfie, or meandering through the canals of Venice, we’ve been going on running dates with Los Angeles for the past several years. Rain or shine, moonlight or darkness, we always show up with a desire to connect the people of LA a bit more. 
 
 We Angelenos spend too much time in our cars, on our phones, at our desks and disconnected from each other. Breaking these habits can be tough. But, BlacklistLA is encouraging a rapidly growing community of residents to do so though its runs. Whether it’s the Monday night run to a featured piece of street art, the weekday “Metro Run” that involves us hopping on the subway, or the Saturday morning run when we explore different neighborhoods, BlacklistLA is changing the way Angelenos engage with the city and each other. The innovative approach BlacklistLA is taking to build community has caught the eye of Runner’s World magazine, the LA Times, Los Angeles Magazine and the Mayor’s Office. And with nearly 13,000 followers on Instagram, Angelenos clearly want more. 
 
 To build on this momentum, BlacklistLA is seeking to expand the number of opportunities residents have to connect. We envision a Los Angeles where Angelenos are linked to one another through sport, the alternative forms of transportation they take, and the shared appreciation they have for the city’s diversity. To get there, in 2016 Blacklist seeks to: 
 
 (1) Offer more runs throughout the city by aligning with Mayor Garcetti’s Great Streets Initiative. The Mayor’s Office has selected one street in each of the 15 council districts to receive improvements to make them more pedestrian-friendly. By tapping into the City’s initiative, BlacklistLA will bring Angelenos together to experience LA’s Great Streets. 
 (2) Foster deeper connections between Angelenos who are working toward a shared race goal. BlacklistLA will be creating training groups for the Happy Birthday LA 5k, LA Chinatown Firecracker 10K, Hollywood Half Marathon and Los Angeles Marathon. 
 (3) Expand BlacklistLA’s Happy Birthday LA 5K. Last month, BlacklistLA held its inaugural Happy Birthday LA 5K to celebrate the City’s 234th. The race attracted nearly 500 runners to the start line at Olvera Street, the City’s birthplace. With support from LA 2050, BlacklistLA hopes to attract 1000 to next year's race.","The only barrier we anticipate is the hefty price tag associated with the Happy Birthday LA 5K. While many of the costs are covered by registration fees and sponsorships, the city permits for street closures in the downtown area amounted to $20,000. We are hopeful that our relationship with the Mayor’s Office will yield a waiver of such fees. If that does not occur, we have already started to seek support to have this cost underwritten. 
 
 BlacklistLA’s tremendous achievements have been fueled by the volunteer energies of a committed group of individuals. While the organization has done an outstanding job of developing a constant supply of volunteers who serve as pacers, safety marshals, and brand promoters, it is clear that dedicated staff would allow BlacklistLA to take its vision to the next level. If for any reason, BlacklistLA weren’t able to garner the support needed to hire staff, the organization has created a sustainable approach to maintain its current offerings.","The success of our work will be measured by our ability to make progress toward our expected outcomes. Included below are our two desired outcomes: 
 (1) More Angelenos will be connected through BlacklistLA (BLA) offerings.
 Number of Angelenos who attend BLA runs, number of repeat runners, number of runners in BLA training groups for targeted races, number of runners who participate in BLA's 5k, diversity of communities of BLA runners, presence of BLA community members at races and number of Angelenos who follow BLA’s social media.
 
 (2) More Angelenos will experience alternative forms of transportation and different neighborhoods of L.A. 
 Number of Angelenos who are exposed to and take public transit at least once per month. Number of Angelenos who report that BLA has exposed them to a new neighborhood
 
 We will be tracking these numbers and data points throughout the year. All of the data will be the basic information used for any midcourse corrections that need to be made.","There are numerous running groups in LA that are doing a great job at getting people outdoors – LA Leggers, The Nike Run Club, Rundalay, Boyle Heights Bridgerunners, just to name a few. While our missions are complementary, BlacklistLA brings the unique approach of integrating street art, alternative transportation and a love for LA and civic life to the table. 
 
 Outside of the running community, Ciclavia is the perhaps doing the most complementary work to the mission and vision of BlacklistLA. We have learned from their approach to creating opportunities for Angelenos to connect, get outdoors and use alternative means of transportation. And we look forward to the opportunity of working more closely with Ciclavia in the years to come once we have dedicated staff to cement those partnerships.","To make this idea a reality, several key collaborators and partners will be involved in our work: 
 BlacklistLA Steering Committee and Volunteers: Strategic Guidance - $0
 LA Chinatown Firecracker Run Committee: Fiscal Sponsorship - $0
 Mayor’s Office: Alignment with Great Streets Urban Renewal Program $0","The total cost of the initiative is approximately double of what we are seeking from LA2050 - $200,000. However, this additional amount will be covered through in-kind donations, volunteer time, and sponsorships. We have runners who have offered to volunteer their time to execute the runs; we have videographers and a webmaster who have committed to furthering the brand; and we have colleagues in the public art and transportation realms who advise us on strategic areas to visit in the city. We will also continue to pursue foundation funding for our efforts.","Executive Director- $40,000
 BlacklistLA Run and Training Group Supplies - $15,000
 Volunteer Appreciation Event - $5000
 Happy Birthday LA 5K - $25,000
 Administrative Costs - $15,000
 Total: $100,000","As a growing movement of Angelenos, BlacklistLA always has scaling at the front of our mind. We believe that a one-year, $100,000 investment in BlacklistLA will allow the organization to effectively keep pace with the high demand, as well as determine how to promote future growth. We believe that our scalability lies in our ability to offer more runs throughout the city, as well as our ability to connect people in-person and online."
5102030,Blind Childrens Center to strengthen new Social Skills Program with CREATIVE GROWTH CENTER,2015017,,,"This year the Blind Children's Center launched a first-of-its-kind, 3-Year Social Skills Program to specifically address the socio-emotional needs of children who are blind or visually impaired.
 
 We aim to build a new Creative Growth Center, consisting of a new playhouse, upgraded lunch area and new sensory garden equipped with adaptive equipment, educational games, and engaging devices to support the development of critical social skills in our students who are blind or visually impaired.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Blind Children's Center; Hollywood; Los Angeles,0CreatePlay0,"A good deal of research and concentration has gone into building best practices and curriculum for early childhood social skills curriculum. However, as a low incidence population, infants who are visually impaired have gone ignored as a group that needs its own dedicated curriculum to steer a healthy life from the earliest days. 
 
 Blind Children’s Center, as a model program and leader in the field, is launching a 3-year Social Skills Pilot Program, with the ultimate goal of producing a social skills curriculum specifically tailored for infants and young children who are blind or visually impaired, both within our four walls and beyond. 
 
 The 3-Year Pilot will culminate in the release of a “Social Skills Curriculum Kit” which will be made available to parents, educators and schools around the United States and throughout the world. The activities within the proposed Creative Growth Center will augment and solidify project results and help build strategy for future exploration in the area.
 
 Just as academic adaptations need to be made for our students who are visually impaired (such as Brailling reading materials), we have found that social skills adaptations must be made, too. Research reveals that as much as 90% of what human beings learn is acquired through sight. Students who have limited or no vision must acquire skills and learn concepts through different methods — such as touch in the case of reading and writing using the Braille code.
 
 Research has found that young people who are visually impaired show a disproportionate propensity toward teenage depression. Evidence indicates that youth may experience isolation due to lack of effective social skills to build healthy bonds and relationships with peers. At a very social time where cliques are forming and children can be exclusionary, young people who are visually impaired often feel left on the outside, without the ability to look in. 
 
 Best practices indicate that the early years are essential for establishing skills and learning readiness. As our program has long been based on full-inclusion, our school is a wonderful place to build the framework for a new curriculum which will allow children who are visually impaired to thrive in the sighted world all around them. It is our goal to continue to expand our presence in the community and make Los Angeles the very best place in the world for children who are blind or visually impaired to grow, learn and become happy, productive adults.","Due to a growth in need, in 2009 the Blind Children's Center launched a successful capital campaign to add Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd Grade to our existing preschool and infant programs. Thanks to that growth, we are now able to provide services to twice as many affected children and their families.
 
 One challenge does persist. Once our students graduate from our program, typically as 2nd graders, we are no longer able to actively guide their growth and education. The goal is to equip our students with critical academic and life skills while they are enrolled at the Center, so when they move on to their next school, they are better equipped to contend with the challenges of being a student with a disability in a mainstream school environment.
 
 We aim to mitigate transitional challenges by equipping parents with skills to guide their child's successful growth, and, more importantly through continued parent groups that are open to caregivers of all enrolled students and alumni.","Evaluation of the Program is the responsibility of the Center’s Director of Education and Family Services, Fernanda Armenta-Schmitt, Ph.D., who has been employed at the Center for 28 years. Dr. Armenta-Schmitt has extensive experience in the arena of early intervention and serving families of young children with significant disabilities, and has authored several publications dedicated to serving families with diverse backgrounds and needs.
 
 She and the Center's specialists and teachers collaborate to develop a Specialized Education Plan for each student and their family. The preschool children’s progress is measured annually using The Oregon Project which is the standard assessment tool for visually impaired children. The Kindergarten through 2nd Grade students receive regular report cards which are reviewed through standard K-2 curriculum guidelines. Parents’ progress is measured on a regular basis, through interviews and questionnaires.","We frequently collaborate with several partner organizations in the area, most notably Braille Institute of America, where some of our students attend Library events and Junior Blind of America, where some of our students attend afterschool programs. Both of the organizations are wonderful partners to us.
 
 Our organization is the only one of its kind however, a full service private school operating in accordance with state educational guidelines, with a full inclusion program (sighted students in each classroom).","We have partnered with the Los Angeles-based Margie & Robert E Petersen Foundation, the Los Angeles-based Atlas Family Foundation and the Vermont-based Gibney Family Foundation for the launch of this program. They have funded the launch of the program as well as staff salaries and the future production of our Social Skills Curriculum Kit.
 
 Our ask through LA2050 is solely for the construction and outfitting of the proposed CREATIVE GROWTH CENTER, which would support the activities of the Social Skills Program at the Blind Children's Center.","We estimate the proposed work with cost approximately $100,000. We intend to cover any additional cost, if necessary, through additional grantseeking as well as major donor appeals.","CREATIVE GROWTH CENTER

 * All estimates include material and labor","At the end of the 3-year project, we will compile our findings in a user-friendly, interactive “Social Skills Curriculum Kit” which will be made available to parents, educators, early intervention programs and other schools. The potential construction and success of our Creative Growth Center will be another strategy to build social skills in our population. These results, too, should be able to be replicated and scaled by like-minded organizations should they choose to follow our lead.
 
 We anticipate the hard work we put into this undertaking will yield an out-of-the-box curriculum that can be used as a model to tackle a very real issue facing young people who are visually impaired. With the appropriate social skills to go along with strong educational skills, our students and others like them will be equipped to make friends, live independently, and fulfill their highest potential."
5102310,Blue/Green Jobs for a Climate Resilient Los Angeles,2016230,,,"The Water LA job training and certification program will build our city’s water-smart workforce. Local NGOs and green businesses will partner with LA Trade Tech to develop curricula and provide instructor training for low-cost courses in the design, installation, and maintenance of climate resilient residential urban acupuncture strategies. The courses will train a skilled workforce to support Angelenos in transforming their homes to capture, conserve, and reuse precious water resources.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,LA Trade Tech,Live,"The Water LA Training and Certification program will expand the city’s pool of workers capable of retrofitting and maintaining LA homes and yards to capture, conserve, and reuse water. It will help expand LA’s local water supply, improve water quality in local streams, increase tree canopy, enhance climate resilience, and strengthen our green economy.
 
 Today, LA relies on imported water for nearly 90% of its supply. Meanwhile, rain that falls in the city runs off from roads to storm drains to the LA River to the ocean, wasting a potential supply and polluting our waterways in the process. This system of water management is not sustainable.
 
 The Water LA program aims to improve this situation by spreading water harvesting practices to residential landscapes across the region. Replacing thirsty, rain-repelling turf with native plants, rain gardens and edible landscapes; installing rain tanks and greywater systems to provide alternative irrigation sources; building infiltration trenches and parkway basins to recharge our aquifers and capture runoff from the street – Water LA aims to expand adoption of all of these urban acupuncture solutions.
 
 LA’s enthusiastic response to local turf rebate programs shows how eager residents are to make their homes more water-resilient and cut their potable water use. But many Angelenos encounter barriers to making these changes on their own, like a lack of technical skills to do the design and installation, or a shortage of time to do proper maintenance. These residents have struggled to find professionals trained in water-smart retrofitting or maintenance. 
 
 We aim to close this gap between LA’s desire for water and climate resilient home landscapes and their ability to design, implement, and maintain those retrofits by training local gardeners, contractors, and youth in techniques to capture, conserve, and reuse water on residential parcels. We will work with expert NGOs and green businesses to develop appropriate curriculum and to train instructors at LA Trade Tech (a member of the LA Community College District), enabling them to offer the curriculum in the fall of 2016.
 
 This training will enable and empower residents to make changes on their properties and cultivate a new culture of water stewardship across the city. It will also bolster the city’s green economy - helping the design, construction and maintenance of residential green infrastructure grow into a recognized and legitimate trade in our region and beyond.","Finding instructors with extensive training in these specialized technical areas will be a challenge. LA Trade Tech will deliver the courses, allowing the program to take advantage of the strong institutional infrastructure in place through the region’s community college district. While the school employs excellent technical instructors with years of experience, few have completed formal coursework in these specialties. Even fewer have studied them through an integrated lens and a practical, hands-on framework. These circumstances could create teaching challenges.
 
 When the curriculum is developed, we will work through this challenge by providing an intensive “train the trainers” course to Trade Tech instructors. We will work with Watershed Management Group, a Tucson-based NGO that routinely conducts trainings in this field, to develop and teach a pedagogy-focused course for staff at the college.","We will measure our success by our ability to hit two key benchmarks by August 2016:
 
 • Successful development of curricula for courses in the design, installation, and maintenance of key urban acupuncture strategies (site assessment, rain tanks, rain grading, native plants, greywater systems, parkway basins, infiltration trenches, permeable surfaces, and edible landscapes);
 • Administration of a “train the trainers” course for LA Trade Tech instructors.
 
 Completing curriculum development and teacher training will enable LA Trade Tech to offer these courses to students in the fall of 2016.","We are intentionally partnering with organizations offering similar trainings to develop the curricula for these courses. These NGOs and small businesses agree that this community college-based instructional approach is complementary to (and not competitive with) their existing efforts. 
 
 We collectively seek to support widespread transfer of these skills and rapid uptake of these strategies throughout Los Angeles. Instituting an integrated training program that’s affordable and accessible to both youth and professionals in transition helps accelerate this shift. Partnering with LA Trade Tech helps establish this skill set as a legitimate trade.
 
 We are also working with our agency partners on a program tailored to educate city workers in green infrastructure design and maintenance. While urban acupuncture and green infrastructure work at different scales and under a different regulatory framework, they share the same principles and practices. As such, graduates of the Water LA Training Program would be well positioned to move into municipal careers if they chose, offering the City a well-trained 21st century workforce.
 
 This program differs from existing offerings in three key ways: duration, depth, and scope. Water LA’s program will be spread out over a longer period of time than most comparable programs. Some of our partner organizations – American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association, Greywater Action, and Watershed Management Group – offer occasional, intensive trainings in their specialty areas. These courses are designed to facilitate intensive learning over a short period of time, and are best suited to workers who can take a block of days off from work. Water LA, operating on a community college semester timetable, will appeal to local workers whose schedules don’t allow them to access courses structured in this manner. Water LA’s program will include a significant apprenticeship component, offering a greater depth of guided learning than our partner organizations’ existing programs. 
 
 The Water LA Training program will offer classes in a wide range of water and climate resilient retrofits. Most existing courses are specialized, focusing on a single technique. Offering all the courses in the framework of a comprehensive, integrated program within a single institution, differentiates the program from the others, allowing our partners to continue to target workers focused on developing a single area of expertise.","Our partners include many of the City agencies, NGOs, and green businesses that collaborated with us throughout the development of the Water LA pilot program. That program retrofit three-dozen homes with urban acupuncture, and through an iterative stakeholder process, developed standard plans and guidance for a suite of affordable strategies for homeowners. These plans and guides are slated for formal adoption by the City of Los Angeles at the end of 2015.
 
 Several of these partners will continue to collaborate with us over the next three years on the Water LA Phase 2 project, where we will retrofit 100 homes and install 1,000 parkway basins in disadvantaged and climate vulnerable communities in the San Fernando Valley.
 
 Our relationship with LA Trade Tech has been developing over the past year through a series of discussions with Community College Trustees, Chancellors, and staff. 
 
 For the Water LA Training and Certification Program, LADWP, LA Sanitation, LA Building & Safety, and LA Trade Tech will all provide in-kind time and expertise to the program development. 
 
 The River Project will provide project management, facilitate coordination among partners, participate in curriculum development and training the trainers across all strategies, and receive $33,000. Watershed Management Group will participate in curriculum development for site assessment, rain tanks and rain grading/rain gardens, facilitate overall program integration, lead the “train the trainers” effort, and receive $27,000. The American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association, Greywater Action, La Loma Development and Theodore Payne Foundation will participate in curriculum development and training for their respective specialities, and receive $10,000 each.","We anticipate that integrating and adapting existing materials, development of a comprehensive, bi-lingual curricula, delivery of a successful “train-the-trainers” course, and technical support for instructors over the first program year will cost approximately $150,000. 
 
 We are currently working with LADWP and LASAN on developing a “blue-green academy” to train city workers in water-related green infrastructure design and maintenance. This program is complementary to ours, and we are in discussion with them about providing additional support to the Water LA Training and Certification Program.","Task Budget:
 
 Curriculum Development: $60,000 
 Train the Trainers course:  $15,000 
 Project Management & Coordination: $25,000","Throughout the program development, we will be working closely with the Trustees and Chancellors of the LA Community College District to lay the groundwork for a plan to scale the program up to be offered at the other Community Colleges throughout the region: Mission, Valley, Pierce, City, East, West, Southwest and Harbor. 
 
 As Angelenos interest in adopting urban acupuncture strategies grows, students in the first three years of classes will have opportunities to serve requisite field apprenticeships with Water LA small business partners, and with our NGO partners as we retrofit 100 more homes and 1,000 parkway basins through the Water LA Phase 2 pilot.
 
 Our ultimate aim is to design a curriculum that can be transferred to colleges throughout the California Community College System and ultimately, the west."

We are creating a culture of curiosity and innovation that will grow and retain top talent, as well as drive research funding, private investments, and environmental startups. We want the name ""Los Angeles"" to be to the environmental science world what ""Hollywood"" is to the film world by 2050.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"Blueprint Earth makes L.A. the best place to create by building, growing, and sustaining a culture of curiosity. Blueprint Earth is creating the foundation for Los Angeles to become the world leader in environmental science and technology research by 2050. The Blueprint First program reaches elementary students early. The Blueprint Labs program creates opportunities for older students. The Mission Mojave project creates “blueprints” of our planet’s environments by engaging scientists and engineers. Blueprint Earth is creating the perfect atmosphere for new technologies, new research, and new types of manufacturing and production.
 
 Blueprint Earth gives traditionally under-represented students access to positive science role models. The Blueprint First science literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary in Pacoima starts this fall by connecting real scientists with 225 students. The scientists and students work together to create memorable hands-on science experiments. This helps students discover the world while generating enthusiasm for learning about the planet.
 
 Blueprint Earth is creating an environmental science laboratory for Angelenos in high school and college to learn real skills that will prepare them for vocational lab jobs, or for work or higher education after earning a degree. The Blueprint Labs program will work with private companies, universities, and the government to study environments, and will create paid jobs for young adults in Los Angeles.
 
 For the future of the entire city of Los Angeles, Blueprint Earth is creating teams of scientists and engineers working together to understand the environment in new ways. Our signature project, Mission Mojave, supports these teams as they create environmental blueprints, which will help protect, preserve, and restore damaged environments. This type of collaboration between professionals leads to revolutionary discoveries and innovation.
 
 Blueprint Earth’s programs are creating a culture of curiosity focused on environmental science in Los Angeles. Blueprint First creates environment passion in our youngest citizens. Blueprint Labs creates real career skills for young adults. Finally, Mission Mojave creates real knowledge about how the planet functions, and opens possibilities for exciting discoveries and creative solutions to environmental problems facing Los Angeles in the 21st century.","The major challenge Blueprint Earth anticipates is with communication. Delivering the organization’s message to the number of people required for optimum engagement requires significant grassroots effort. Blueprint Earth wants Los Angeles to be to the environmental science world what Hollywood is to the film world. That level of name recognition requires strategic message distribution.
 
 This challenge will be overcome by word-of-mouth campaigns, media coverage, publication of research results, presentations at professional conferences, appearances at schools, public lectures to community groups, and by social media campaigns. The work needs to be publicized in media-friendly ways to keep the science accessible. Careful messaging planning will ensure that Blueprint Earth can build on early success in raising awareness. In Blueprint Earth’s first two years of operation, the organization was featured in numerous publications, including The Huffington Post and Popular Science magazine.","The Blueprint First program will require evaluation of whether the program activities proceed as planned and produce the expected results. Evaluations will occur during each academic year using short student knowledge questionnaires both pre and post each Blueprint First session. Classroom teachers will be surveyed throughout the year to assess program success.
 
 The participant experience and work of Blueprint Labs will be evaluated using customer and participant case studies, customer satisfaction surveys, participant demographic surveys, and documentation reviews to measure customer satisfaction and the overall program benefit.
 
 Mission Mojave is evaluated through participant interviews, demographic surveys, observation, and case studies. Success is measured by invitations to present at professional science conferences and publication in scientific journals. The final measure of Mission Mojave’s success is the replication of the natural study environment in a controlled setting.","Blueprint Earth is the catalyst for Los Angeles to become the world leader in environmental science and technology. No other organization is attempting this type of work from a holistic, community-focused perspective. This work touches the environment, science, and education and has tangible impact on Los Angeles. Blueprint Earth’s programs have served 76% females, 56% non-white minorities, and 60% of participants come from low-income households, groups traditionally under-represented in science.
 
 Currently, there are no other organizations approaching environmental science work this way. Some programs focus on individual fields, like biology. Others are designed to conserve a particular environment, like a single watershed. Still others are geared toward species conservation. Organizations like the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Critical Zone Observatories, and Biosphere2 have superficial similarity to Blueprint Earth, but discussion with these organizations indicates Blueprint Earth’s approach is both distinctive and unique. Additionally, Blueprint Earth was recognized as groundbreaking in Popular Science magazine’s May 2015 issue.
 
 The Mission Mojave program has included scientists and students from 11 universities and 20 private companies in California. These science teams have gathered 1,500 unique observations about the Mojave Desert. This work spans geology, hydrology, biology, and atmospheric science. Collaboration between scientific disciplines is currently both infrequent and highly encouraged by major grantmaking organizations like the National Science Foundation. Blueprint Earth’s work fills a gap in the current approach to environmental science.
 
 Blueprint Earth focuses on creating environmental science opportunities for Angelenos from childhood through their professional careers. Educational programs are often designed to train teachers, or modify science curriculum. Blueprint First brings diverse, culturally relevant scientists into the classroom, allowing students the opportunity to work with positive role models. Blueprint Labs creates a working environmental science lab that will serve as a training center for young scientists and lab technicians to gain real career skills. These job opportunities for young science professionals are currently rare. Mission Mojave’s environmental research is unique in that it creates a big-picture view of environments that are too often only looked at in a very narrow, specialized way.","Blueprint Earth is currently partnered with Haddon Avenue Elementary School in Pacoima and the California State University, Los Angeles Hydrogeology Student Union. Neither of the partners will receive any of the $100,000 grant award directly. A portion of the award money will go towards running our science literacy pilot program at Haddon Avenue Elementary School, and a small portion will go towards reimbursing members of the California State University, Los Angeles Hydrogeology Student Union for travel expenses (gas money) from their campus to Haddon during outreach activities.","Blueprint Earth anticipates program costs to be $495,000. Of that amount, $395,000 will come from donations in kind as indicated in the detailed budget breakdown. To date, operations have progressed with limited cash flow and reliance on volunteers to deliver the majority of program services. The Blueprint Earth mission resonates with the demographic of the core volunteers who typically range from 18 to 40 years of age. This has made the previous two years of growth a success. With $100,000 in funding, Blueprint Earth will be able to accomplish program goals that would otherwise cost $395,000. Historically, funds raised have been approximately $20,000 annually, and the organization has delivered six times that value using donations in kind. The impact to the community has been a value of $120,000 per year. $100,000 in funds from LA 2050 would allow Blueprint Earth to accelerate growth and begin a path to sustainability by creating a stream of organizational revenue from the Blueprint Labs program.","Grant funding will be applied to support three programs that contain the full cycle of making L.A. the leader in environmental science and technology.

 LA 2050 funding will enable completion of Phase 1 of 3 for Mission Mojave. Phase 2 of Mission Mojave (blueprint creation) will be funded by Blueprint Labs revenue. Phase 3 of Mission Mojave (environmental replication) will remain, and strong individual and corporate giving programs are in the planning stage. Blueprint Earth is funded with support from Edison International, Qualcomm, Cadiz Ltd., and Healthy Souls. Funding for future work will be sought from current funders as well as new grantmakers. 
 
 The key to scaling and future projects (e.g., Mission Tundra, Mission Rainforest, etc.) is positioning Blueprint Labs as a source of sustainable revenue. The combination of individual donations, grants, and earned revenue will continue progress on blueprinting all of Earth’s environments with L.A. as the home base. The foundation Blueprint Earth is building in the diverse, resource-rich city of Los Angeles will place our city as the global leader in environmental science by 2050. A timeline follows.

Bresee’s Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court will provide over 2,500 youth and families in Central Los Angeles with healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang involvement, and positive youth development. Bresee’s two side-by side sport courts will be used for basketball, soccer, adult community leagues, zumba classes, and community events.
 
 Bresee serves people living in Central Los Angeles. President Obama recently identified Bresee’s underserved urban area as one of the first five national “Promise Zones,” due to the high level of economic need. Youth in Bresee’s Central Los Angeles Sports programs face underperforming schools with dropout rates at 40%, high rates of gang violence and drug use (with youth indicating that they “often face intimidation from gang members”) and 60% of individuals are overweight or obese. Understanding the value of sports in preventing childhood obesity, protecting students from gang involvement, and teaching important lessons in teamwork and character, Bresee’s program offers a variety of free services to youth and adults, with an emphasis on youth development
 
 By transforming Bresee’s underutilized parking lot into a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility, Bresee will provide over 2,500 youth and families with:
 
 1. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITIVE LEAGUES: Over 600 youth (ages 11-18) will be trained through ongoing competitive soccer and basketball leagues and recreational sports. Students will not only improve their athletic skills and physical health but also learn character, discipline and sportsmanship. 
 2. ADULT LEAGUES: Bresee will foster healthy community among 140 local adults through evening league play. 
 3. LAFC YOUTH LEADERSHIP ACADEMY: Bresee will replicate its successful South Los Angeles LAFC program at its Central Los Angeles community center. LAFC is a unique partnership between the Los Angles Police Department 77th Division, schools, non-profits, and collegiate/professional soccer players. Bresee’s Central LA LAFC will train and mentor 15 at-risk high schoolers to conduct soccer training and organize soccer clinics for over 300 neighborhood youth annually.
 4. FAMILY EVENTS: Bresee will provide 1,000 family members with free activities (movie nights, zumba) that increase interaction between family members of different generations.","Bresee does not anticipate that any factors may interfere with achieving its desired objectives. With over 25 years of youth education and enrichment program experience, Bresee has been able to overcome challenges as they come without it affecting the overall effectiveness of its programs.","Bresee’s Athletics Director, Sports Coordinator, and LAFC Director evaluate work through maintaining attendance using Bresee’s customized internal database, administering pre-/post-tests, collecting report cards, and collecting testimonials showing qualitative impact. Relevant data is reviewed quarterly to ensure progress and completion of objectives. 
 
 However, the true measure of Bresee’s success will be the youth who overcome risk factors, pursuing their education, achieving their potential and learning the value of service. Carlos, a 12 year old who was struggling in school but fell in love with soccer at Bresee, exemplifies this: “Bresee’s soccer program taught me the pillars of character: responsibility, respect, citizenship, caring, fairness, and trustworthiness. I began using them at home, school and Bresee. Bresee taught me how to work hard to achieve my goals. My goals are to go to college, become a soccer player, and be a good role model to my five siblings.”","Though there are organizations that provide sport leagues in the Central Los Angeles community, Bresee differs from them in three ways. First, Bresee provides free programming, in comparison with other agencies that provide soccer and basketball programming at a fee which the low-income youth Bresee serves cannot afford. Second, Bresee’s sport leagues emphasize character and leadership development in all aspects of practice and competitive play. Programs instill character using the Character Counts curriculum and address health issues and juvenile delinquency using the US Soccer and Pure Game Curriculum. Lastly, Bresee’s Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court programming takes place in the context of a holistic afterschool setting, where sports leagues, youth development programs, and family activities are offered in conjunction with programs in Academics, Career-readiness, STEM, Arts, Service, Family Services, and Gang Prevention. 
 
 Bresee’s approach is unique in that it provides mentors and coaches who model and teach character and leadership, giving students who might otherwise seek role models from gangs a positive alternative. In addition, Bresee offers opportunity for healthy physical activity and exceptional soccer and basketball training, improving physical health and developing students’ identities as athletes. It also provides paid leadership opportunities as interns, creating jobs for young people and building the next generation of community change agents. Lastly, it connects family members across different generations by providing activities including zumba, family movie nights, and community sports leagues.","Bresee’s has forged key partnerships with local stakeholders and community organizations including: 
 
 • CENTRAL CITY BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, provides Bresee youth with a competitive basketball experience playing against other local agencies including HOLA, Casa de Amigos, YMCA, and Salvation Army. 
 • YOUTH PREMIER SOCCER LEAGUE, Bresee’s indoor and outdoor soccer teams compete against AJAX, Virgil Middle School, and Children’s Institute.
 • LAPD 77TH DIVISION, provides at least one officer at designated LAFC events, assists with community outreach, and provides leadership and character development during LAFC’s summer training. LAFC youth leaders conduct soccer clinics at 77th Division for the participants LAPD Cadet Community Youth Programs.
 • Los Angeles newest soccer team MLS LAFC, UCLA, USC, CSU Northridge, Loyola Marymount, Colorado Rapids player James Riley and MLS player Mike Lahoud, provide guest coaches and access to professional/collegiate level games. 
 • Pure Game provides the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum for soccer leaders. This curriculum teaches youth positive values through the sport of soccer and supports Bresee with its goal of developing character-driven leaders who will transform Los Angeles.
 
 In order to provide services that equip Bresee’s young athletes to excel in sports and in life, Bresee partners with the Wilshire FamilySource Center to provide afterschool youth programs and wrap around family services. Bresee works closely with Virgil Middle School, Belmont High School, Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, Camino Nuevo High School, and Central City Value High School to recruit students for its athletics programs. 
 
 All of Bresee’s community partners are unpaid volunteers with the exception of Pure Game. Bresee will provide Pure Game with $10,000 to equip Bresee's staff and high school interns with training on the STAR & SOCCER character and education curriculum.","The total budget for Bresee’s multi-sport safe place to play is $194,160. Bresee has secured $14,500 through in-kind support, $73,730 from the Finish Line Youth Foundation, $15,000 from KaBoom!/ US Soccer Foundation, and $10,000 from ESPN, Inc. Fundraising expenses are covered through Bresee’s existing general operating support grants from foundation’s including The Rose Hills Foundation ($50,000), and The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation ($75,000). 
 
 Bresee will cover additional costs through its diversified portfolio of funders. Bresee operates on a $1.8 million budget annually, with more than 80% of operating expenses allocated directly to programs. Of its annual budget, 50% is funded by foundation grants, 40% by government grants, and 10% by individual donors and events. Through an auction, sponsorships, and donations at the annual Dinner & Auction event, Bresee is able to raise unrestricted funds for its programs. In 2014, this event raised over $150,000. Bresee is also supported by a diverse board, which raised over $250,000 in 2014, over $90,000 more than 2013, demonstrating increasing fundraising capacities. Last year, 100% of Bresee’s 13 board members contributed financially to Bresee. Bresee maintains regular contact with stakeholders and individual donors through annual reports, website, social media, bi-monthly mail appeals, and e-newsletters. Bresee’s development team continues to focus on writing grants and seeking new funding sources, specifically including funders interested in programs in the South Los Angeles area. Bresee’s demonstrated ability to secure matching funds is evident in that it raised over $900,000 in foundation and corporate support in 2014.","Bresee respectfully requests $100,000 to allocate towards the completion of it Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court and program related costs. Below are the budget justifications:
 
 Personnel: Bresee will hire a part-time Sports Coordinator ($25,000) to coordinate all sport court programming. Bresee will also employ a part-time LAFC Director ($25,000) to replicate and oversee Bresee’s Central Los Angeles LAFC program. Bresee will provide 15 high school interns with a stipend of $1,000 each ($15,000 total).
 
 Program Supplies: Bresee will purchase basketball backboard extensions ($10,000), and two scoreboards ($5,000). Other programmatic materials include athletic equipment ($5,000), and audiovisual equipment ($3,000) to facilitate Family Movie Nights, and Zumba classes.
 
 Training: Pure Game will provide training on Curriculum ($10,000).
 
 Maintenance: Spray washing and sweeping the court surface and any other maintenance related costs ($2,000).","Bresee plans to scale the success of its Safe Place to Play Multi-Sport Court by serving as a model for KaBoom! and the US Soccer Foundation’s Lets Play Initiative, which seeks to transform underutilized spaces in underserved neighborhoods into designated places to play. This will allow Bresee to lead the way in creating safe places where youth and families have access to healthy physical activity, safe alternatives to gang involvement, and positive youth development activities.
 
 Additionally, Bresee is currently seeking to partner with the new Major League Soccer Team LAFC to replicating its sports programming in other high need areas of Los Angeles including East Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Pacoima, Mar Vista, and Venice. Lastly, Bresee envisions current program participants returning as college graduates to expand services to other areas in Los Angeles and to continue Bresee’s track record of creating the next generation of community leaders."
5102020,Bring Back the River: Restoring the Los Angeles River Watershed,2015013,,,"The Arroyo River Parks Program (ARPP) will build community support for re-imagining our watershed from a sterile concrete channel to a vibrant river ecosystem.
 
 The ARPP program will educate citizens about the river revitalization planned by the Army Core of Engineers on the Arroyo Seco Stream in Los Angeles County.
 
 To reach out to the community we want to establish a native plant nursery that will be the central location of our effort to reconnect the community to the LA River Watershed.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0CreatePlay0,"The Arroyo Seco Stream that begins in the San Gabriel Mountains is a major tributary of the Los Angeles River with its confluence at the 110 FWY and the 5 FWY. During the 1930’s the stream was lined with concrete to accelerate the rate of water to protect against flooding. In this action the Arroyo lost its ability to provide habitat for aquatic species and tremendous opportunities for people to appreciate the Arroyo. Our mission in making Los Angeles a better place to connect is to restore the connection between people and water. The Arroyo River Parks Program (ARPP) was started in 2008 and provides a plan to connect 30 open spaces parks around the Arroyo Seco. The connectivity will provide trails and recreation from Downtown Los Angeles to the Foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. This plan also calls for the removal of concrete and re-implementation of native vegetation in an effort to #BringBackTheRiver.
 
 Fortunately our vision to restore the stream has been shared by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USCAE) and the County of Los Angeles Public Works. In 2011 the Arroyo Seco Watershed Ecosystem Restoration Study outlined several options for restoring the Arroyo Seco Stream. This upcoming spring 2016 the USACE will present several alternatives for the project. Our mission in applying for this grant funding is to garnish public input that will be presented to the USACE. We believe community input on this process will ultimately propel the project and will be a model for future river restoration throughout Southern California. To bolster support we would like to hold monthly workshops throughout the communities on this issue, in an effort to spur public dialogue and provide insight to the USACE. Furthermore making Los Angeles a better place to connect requires the support and contribution of all individuals, especially in restoring river vitality in light of an historic drought in Southern California. Therefore the need to bring about community awareness on water issues is not only imperative but urgent for our water sustainable vision of Los Angeles in 2050.
 
 In our involvement with the community on this issue we have started a native plant nursery at the head waters of the Arroyo Seco Stream. The Hahamongna Cooperative Nursery seeks to bring in volunteers and community officials to re-connect with native plants. We want the nursery to be a central part of our efforts, and need this grant to purchase a permanent lease.",A major obstacle is the lack of public awareness of the importance of our rivers and natural resources in urban Southern California. Our goal is to create water-sensitive citizens and communities. The current drought has awakened many Southern Californians to the scarcity of water in our region and the importance of efforts to take decisive steps to protect and enhance local resources. We need to do more to protect our streams and rivers. We need to capture stormwater and save it for dry periods and recycle the water we import from afar. All of this starts with an awareness of our local environment and the rich resources it provides. The Arroyo River Parks Program will address this obstacle by working with the communities along the Arroyo Seco Stream to participate in the process. The public workshops we will conduct will be carefully planned to be visionary and participatory.,"The real test of the effectiveness of this campaign will be the extent to which we have influenced public support for the restoration of a living stream in the Arroyo Seco. We will evaluate our project by the amount of public support we can turn out for the USACE’s unveiling of project alternatives and amount of public comments provided. 
 
 In building public support we want to work with as many schools, government agencies, and other non-profit organizations as we can to educate them on the Arroyo Seco Stream restoration plan and our wider effort in the ARPP. We also want to ensure the future of our plant nursery, so that future restoration projects have locally climate adapted plants at the ready. 
 
 How many people attend the workshops? 
 How many people provide comments on the USACE alternatives? 
 How many governmental agencies and stakeholder organizations co-sponsor the workshops?
 How many volunteer hours at the nursery and in action projects?","Yes there are several others, what makes us unique is the scale of the Arroyo Seco Stream. The Arroyo is only a portion of the Los Angeles River Watershed, and is very feasible for restoration. By restoring this smaller portion first, it can provide a model for future large scale restoration on the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers. No major river restoration has been conducted as of yet, by doing so would begin a new chapter in re-mediating water resources in So Cal.
 
 Secondly, we have started a native plant nursery at the Hahamongna Watershed Park. Here we took an abandon Forest Service Nursery that was intended to cultivate vegetation for restoration, and made it into a public open space for people to participate in restoration. With this grant we can up scale our operation and provide native plants to Los Angeles County and all future restoration projects, especially our Arroyo River Parks Program.","Many Arroyo Seco organizations have been working together for many years to improve our communities and the Arroyo Seco Watershed. With the leadership of the Arroyo Seco Foundation, we have formed CASO – the Council of Arroyo Seco Organizations a dynamic forum for organizations working to make a difference in the quality of life in our region through issues such as transportation, environment, outdoor recreation, historic preservation, education, and many more.
 
 At the head of this organization we hope to bring in support for river restoration from the following groups: Cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, Los Angeles, and La Canada Flintridge and the County Department of Public Works and the United States Army Core of Engineers. We would also like to reach out to all schools, churches, and other non-profits to participate in this council.","We estimate our project will cost around 129,000,000.

The program will give kids who have a sincere desire to pursue Martial Arts like Bruce, but simply cannot afford to do so, the opportunity to participate.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"From a young age Bruce Lee found himself in situations many of today’s youth can relate to. Bullying, street fighting, searching for ways to boost self-confidence and self-awareness to prepare for life in the real world. At 13, Bruce acted on his sincere desire to start training in martial arts. The rest...is history. 
 
 Our youth deserves a philosophy to help them become more true, more whole, and more connected. Studying martial arts is proven to help kids increase self-confidence, self-discipline, self-esteem, focus, social skills and connect mind & body. As an organization based in Culver City, with staff and family living in Los Angeles County, it is imperative to us that the youth in our greater community are provided the tools and opportunities they need to be the best version of themselves possible, which can only stand to benefit the city of Los Angeles and foster it's future ambassadors. 
 
 By partnering with existing after school care providers such as Boys & Girls Club, and piloting programs within middle and high schools in the LA county area (targeting lower income areas), the Bruce Lee's Little Dragons program will use Bruce Lee as a vehicle to educate, motivate and inspire the youth in our community. 
 
 In the first 12 months, 10 qualified martial arts and self-defense instructors, hand-picked by the Bruce Lee Foundation, will be sent to a group of 120 clubs and schools within the LA county area for a period of 4 weeks at a time - one 2-hour lesson per week, with an average of 20 kids per class. The curriculum will include entry level physical training in martial art and self defense, an introduction to personal health and wellbeing, bully defense group discussions and sharing Bruce Lee's insights into personal self-cultivation; to honestly express yourself. It is our goal to reach 2400 students within the first 12 months.","A major challenge we anticipate is the cost of human capital needed to manage the program from a high level to ensure the quality of the work and level of education is kept to a high standard at all times. 
 
 To overcome this obstacle we will allocate a specific staff member from our operating budget, to ensure the program is set up for success from the beginning. Also to ensure that grant funding is not diluted through staffing needs, to maximize community impact.","The three core KPI's we will monitor are: 
 
 1) Initial and Repeat Attendance 
 2) Personal Application 
 3) Expansion of Club and School Locations
 
 INITIAL AND REPEAT ATTENDANCE 
 We are confident the iconic energy and cultural relevance of Bruce Lee will encourage initial excitement and strong attendance. A ""full"" class will be considered 20 kids. A core measure of success will be the repeat attendance of students and the continuation of ""full"" classes.
 
 PERSONAL APPLICATION 
 We will work with relevant club and school staff to determine the social effects our curriculum is having on a student by way of their interaction with other students, performance in their studies and extra curricular activities, personal drive and goal setting.
 
 EXPANSION OF CLUB AND SCHOOL LOCATIONS
 In addition to a focus on the individual and the class environment, a key metric of success will be the number of requests to implement the program in new locations around the county.","There are certainly a handful of available Martial Arts after school programs, but these are predominantly located off-footprint, and operated by for-profit entities. 
 
 We are offering our curriculum at no cost, with a view to serve at-risk, underprivileged, and kids without the means or family income to begin their journey to self-actualization. 
 
 Our uniqueness is in our purpose to use Bruce Lee as a vehicle to inspire and motivate the individual mind, body and soul.","The Bruce Lee Foundation is the sole stakeholder in this project.

The initial allocation of $12,000 for marketing materials is largely an investment in content creation to compliment these three verticals. 
 
 1) Peer-2-Peer Fundraising 
 2) Recurring Monthly Donations
 3) Influencers 
 
 PEER-2-PEER FUNDRAISING 
 We will utilize our peer-2-peer fundraising platform to amplify fundraising efforts, giving the power to make a difference directly to our audience, students, schools and clubs by way of personal fundraising campaigns. This type of fundraising is low cost to run, with a high revenue return for the program - increasing the amount of kids we can impact directly. 
 
 RECURRING MONTHLY DONATIONS
 The ability to attract long term recurring monthly donors is strengthened by the program cost per child of $57.50 - making the financial barrier of entry small and the impact on a child's life much greater. We will attract these donors through content creation and engaging marketing campaigns driven by sharing videos, photos and telling the stories of Bruce Lee's Little Dragons via our social media we assets.
 
 INFLUENCERS 
 More and more people are discovering Bruce Lee every day. His social media following alone is now over 20 million. Through the foundations network of corporate, celebrity and social influencers we will share the stories of the kids, clubs and schools taking part in the program to enable larger gifts and partnerships.

5102331,Building a Better LA - Helping to End Skid Row through Jobs,2016242,,,"At Union Rescue Mission, we propose that jobs are the first step to financial stability for those experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. The program we are proposing for this Grants Challenge is our Jobs Program, which helps the men and women we serve do just that – find good, living wage jobs. We propose that as recipients of this $100,000 grant we can expand our current program—and double the number of men and women securing employment (currently at 75) to 150 during 2016.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Skid Row,Live,"Los Angeles County has 366 jobs for every 1,000 adults. But for the men and women who live on Skid Row, the chances of ever finding employment is far less. In fact, most of the people who come through our doors have simply given up trying. As reported by Mayor Garcetti in his Sept. 22 address to the City—the homeless problem is enough to declare a “state of emergency” for homelessness. In fact, Central City LA, or Skid Row, now has the largest population of individuals experiencing homelessness in the State and Country.
 
 At URM, we believe that every person deserves the chance to find, secure and maintain employment to provide for themselves and their families. Over the last 18 months, URM piloted a Jobs Program to help guests prepare for, find and keep jobs. 156 men and women have found living-wage jobs through this project. Our idea is to double our annual goals for job placement over the next year. 
 
 This idea will: 1) expand our job readiness services; 2) create new opportunities to gain work experience and apprenticeships; and 3) build a robust network of employers and training partners to connect our guests with jobs. 
 
 This Grants Challenge will build our capacity to serve more people by hiring two part time employment assistants to join our team, allowing us to fuel further job placement and growth. Our team will work to expand opportunities for more guests to take part in skills training programs through our partners, access educational support from URM’s Learning Center, and receive coaching from our team. Additionally, our team will work alongside our corporate and business partners to expand our network of job placement and training partners—creating a vibrant networking tool for our men and women to use as they search for just the right job. We anticipate that as a result, over the next 12 months, we will place 150 men and women in jobs. 
 
 At URM, we believe that jobs are the key to a future and a hope for the more than 40,000 men and women who are currently experiencing homelessness on the streets of LA County. What better way to transform our city than to provide a tangible pathway from the streets, and from under the bridges, from cars and motels, from hopelessness and despair--through jobs. 
 
 Our idea is simple, but it works, and now we want to expand. Our dream for LA in 2050, is a place where everyone has the chance of a job, food, and a roof over their head.","One of the greatest challenges is overcoming prejudices some employers may have regarding our guests. Some employers are initially held back by beliefs that our guests may not have the job skills needed to maintain employment for the long-term. However, overtime, we have grown to build a trusting and positive relationship with a growing network of employers. Many have discovered that our guests often maintain skills that are extremely well suited to the workforce – such as determination to succeed, or the tenacity and character that is built through hardship.",This project will be evaluated as an on-going part of URM’s commitment to measuring and tracking progress and impact. Outcome measurements tracked will include: number of men and women participating in the program; number of men and women completing training; number of men and women placed in jobs; and the number of men and women maintaining jobs for at least 3 to 6 months. Specific measurements include: 90% of those who participate in readiness program will complete training; more than 150 clients will find employment in 2016; the number of employers working within URM’s employment network will increase by 20% in 2016.,"Although some other organizations do similar work, URM is one of the only organizations that works solely with men and women experiencing homelessness on Skid Row. Our jobs program is uniquely designed to meet their complex and diverse needs--more than just a job placement agency, we provide a highly customized service, helping each individual address their employment struggles with the goal of finding good, living-wage jobs that can turn into a career, not just a pay check. 
 
 The guests URM serve face tremendous obstacles when seeking work. Many are held back by complex problems that stem from a lack of education, neglect or poverty. Many have not completed high school—have very limited work experience, and lack the basic communication and job skills necessary to successfully find and keep a job. At least 75% of those we serve have criminal records making the task of finding work almost impossible in the current job climate. Others suffer from addictions and mental illness, making finding and keeping work an almost impossible task. 
 
 Our program provides an individualized approach that focuses on the following three steps: 1) job readiness (getting guests to a place where they can start looking for work – including education completion and basic works skills training programs, occupational and vocational skills assessments, and career counseling), 2) work experience (giving hard-to-place guests opportunities to be mentored and to get work experience to start building skills that can be used to find work out in the community), followed by: 3) job placement (helping to connect guests with jobs and work-place training in the community). 
 
 Our unique approach helps build the confidence of our guests, including a step-by-step job coaching process for preparing for and finding a job. Activities include occupational and vocational testing to match skills with employment opportunities, access to Employability Competency System to assess academic and cognitive potential of clients, linkage to technical and careers colleges for computer tech and vocational training opportunities, resume writing and/or cover letters as well as communicating with potential employers, access to vocational and occupational training, addressing barriers to employment (such as criminal records), assistance initiating the job search, preparation for and succeeding in an interview, job mentoring from URM corporate volunteers, and securing and keeping employment.","URM works alongside numerous partners as part of this jobs program. They include: Skid Row Redevelopment Corporation – STRIVE, Living Independently Through Employment – LITE, Skid Row Housing Corporation – Avenues to Work Program, Weingart – Workforce and Economic Service Program, Downtown WorkSource Center, Chrysalis, Dress for Success, Job Corp, Vocational Rehab,
 Homeboy Industries, Goodwill Industries, Pacoima Skills Center, WorkSource, Culinary Training Schools, LA Mission College. Employer Partners include: Norms, Toyota/Lexus, Porto Bakery, Southern Girl Bakery, Farmers Boys, Buffalo Wild Wing, Vons, and X-Lines Bowling Alley.

Full costs of this program will be met as a result of on-going fundraising efforts to procure funding from individual donors, corporate and foundation funders, including recent grant funding from US Bancorp. Past grant funding includes Bank of America (a $200,000 Neighborhood Excellence Grant helped launch our jobs program), the Gilead Foundation, and Pfaffinger Foundation.","A $100,000 grant from the Grants Challenge will be used to fund two employment assistants (two part-time salaries at $32,500 each = $65,000), partial funding of our lead job developer ($23,500), and increased costs of supplies, materials and tuition as part of our job readiness classes ($11,500). The impact of this funding will be considerable, with grant funding allowing URM to double the number of men and women placed in jobs during the coming 12 months.","What began as a simple outreach to hungry and homeless men more than 125 years ago has grown to become the largest and most comprehensive program of restoration for men, women, families and youth experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. 
 
 Emerging from the Great Depression as the leading provider of food and shelter in Los Angeles, URM has continued provide bold leadership in its unwavering commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our city. URM was the first organization on Skid Row to open its doors to women, children and families; the first to open a transitional housing program specifically serving single mothers and their children; and the only rescue mission to allow families to stay together in family rooms, as opposed to being separated by age and sex. In this capacity, URM has become the established leader on Skid Row, leading the campaign to end homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. 
 
 Given this rich heritage of forging new pathways and expanding to meet the needs of the population we serve, we are confident that the goals outlined in our program will be achieved within the 12 month timeline, doubling the number of men and women currently place jobs by the end of 2016. 
 
 Building our jobs team will allow URM to significantly scale our program, doubling the number of men and women served during the 12 month grant funding period. Given the critical importance that jobs play in restoring the futures of the men and women we serve, we plan to leverage this grant to attract more funding, building our capacity to grow the meet the increasing needs. Over time, we plan to scale the program to serve all guests who turn to us for help, achieving our ultimate goal of Building a Better LA -- by Helping to End Skid Row through Jobs."

CII’s Integrated Services Model addresses trauma through services in: evidence-based mental health, early childhood, youth development, and family support to treat the whole child and the entire family.",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,"CII Otis Booth Campus Westlake/Rampart Los Angeles; CII New Hampshire Campus Koreatown Los Angeles; CII Watts Campus Watts Los Angeles; CII Burton E. Green Campus Torrance, LA County; and at 29 early education sites in Los Angeles.",00PlayLive,"CII is working to make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by helping our future generations of residents be the healthiest they can be. Serving today’s children and tomorrow’s adult Angelenos through a comprehensive, integrated model, CII is working toward a vision of a healthy and productive Los Angeles. 
 
 CII has developed 3 organization-wide outcomes: Recovery from trauma and other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs); Resiliency to cope with past, present, and future adversity; and Readiness for success in school, work, and life. Understanding that no single service can achieve these goals, CII is proud to do “whatever it takes,” providing each child with the unique combination of services he/she needs to thrive. 
 
 The ultimate goals of CII’s work are to reduce the symptoms resulting from ACEs through clinical intervention and to equip the child with the skills and confidence to bounce back through non-clinical programs. CII aims both to decrease the immediate symptoms of trauma and to achieve the long-term recovery, resiliency, and readiness, which will equip traumatized children to become healthy and productive members of our community as adults. 
 
 Moreover, CII believes that services must be available for the whole child and the entire family to make a positive and lasting impact. Thus CII offers services to the parents of children receiving services, including: parenting education, support groups, financial literacy, fatherhood programming, and workforce development. In some cases, the agency also offers mental health services to parents, most commonly through dyadic clinical services, such as Parent-Child-Interaction Therapy (PCIT). In PCIT, a parent/caregiver is coached to interact with their children by a therapist, speaking to the parent via a microphone in the ear, behind a one-way mirror. 
 
 By comprehensively treating the whole child and the entire family, CII’s services both reduce the symptoms of ACEs now and build a protective factor around parent and child to diminish the impact of ACEs later. 
 
 In addition to making LA the best place to Live, CII is working to make LA the best place to Learn, through increasing the percentage of children enrolled in early education programs across our 29 Head Start sites; to Play, through our afterschool enrichment programs in the arts and sports; and to Connect, through meaningful volunteer engagement opportunities that bring Angelenos together to contribute to their communities.","One of the greatest challenges CII anticipates in reducing the symptoms from ACEs and traumatic experiences is serving children and their families who are un-insured, under-insured, or ineligible for MediCal.
 
 The need in our diverse County is great—almost 60% of children in Los Angeles County have at least one parent who immigrated to the U.S. This increases the likelihood that these individuals do not qualify for government programs, including MediCal. While CII has contracts to provide mental health services, these do not cover individuals who are MediCal-ineligible. 
 
 Thus, while CII may be able to address a child’s early education needs through its Head Start program, the agency may not be able to cover that child’s clinical needs, an integral component of CII’s Model, through existing contracts. Since expanding its early education programs, CII has seen a 20.5% increase in mental health referrals in children ages 0-5, confirming a significant need for these services.","At CII, our services are evaluated by our dedicated Research Evaluation Center (REC). CII’s research staff members gather and analyze the data from our evidence-based clinical services. Each clinical service is evaluated, based upon specific metrics for that particular evidence-based practice (EBP). 
 
 CII provides 12 mental health EBPs and several traditional treatments. Each treatment has its own evaluation criteria, which determines how effectively it is reducing trauma symptoms for a given patient. Some interventions are for older children, some are for younger children, some are dyadic (intended for parent and child), and some are delivered in a group therapy setting. 
 
 CII also measures the acquisition and improvement of social and emotional skills through our community services and youth development programs, using the SEARS (Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Skills) index, a behavior rating scale.","While there are other agencies that deliver mental health services in Los Angeles County, the majority of these providers only specialize in older children or adults. Additionally, agencies typically offer just one service, such a clinical therapy. 
 
 CII is unique because of the agency’s expertise in early childhood mental health for children ages 0-5. As a longtime grantee of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, CII has extensive experience in early childhood trauma and in training professionals, specifically in secondary traumatic stress. Through this work, CII is committed to ensuring that mental health professionals, at both CII and agencies nationwide, do not become burned out and leave the field, where children desperately need their services. 
 
 CII is also unique in its approach—the Integrated Services Model demonstrates CII’s philosophy that clinical services, no matter how high-quality, may not be enough to help a child move from triage to triumph. But, perhaps with a combination of other services, ones that allow the child to develop new skills and build confidence, and with programing for parents that helps to ensure a child’s home is a place of calm rather than chaos, a child will truly be able to recover, build resiliency, and be ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. 
 
 While other agencies may use a few evidence-based practices, CII’s team of experienced and highly qualified mental health professionals enable the agency to offer 12 EBPs. For one of these, Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), CII is the only agency in L.A. County certified to train other agencies in this effective intervention. 
 
 Thus it is CII’s Integrated Services Model, expertise, and commitment to providing the highest quality, evidence-based interventions that make our agency unique among other service providers in Los Angeles.","CII collaborates with many community organizations in County Service Planning Areas (SPAs) 4, 6, and 8; Los Angeles County agencies (including Department of Mental Health-DMH and Department of Children and Family Services-DCFS); the Faith-Based Community; and the Philanthropic Community on a variety of projects. 
 
 CII is also active in the SPA 4 Coalition of service providers and regularly seeks opportunities to work with other agencies.
 
 The work and services outlined in this proposal, however, will only be delivered by CII. Thus, we intend that the full $100,000 of the grant award will be used to support CII’s core operating activities","As LA 2050 understands, recovering from trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences is an ongoing process. “Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences” is likely a Dream Metric for the organization, due to the difficult nature of quantifying both mental health and the effectiveness of the services to treat it. 
 
 At minimum, a child receives 6 months of services from CII. Depending on the child’s experiences, the severity of the trauma, and a number of other factors, a child may need longer. CII’s services are not time-limited, nor is the opportunity to move from clinical to community services. 
 
 Because CII is committed to providing the combination and duration of services each child needs to look to the future and leave their trauma behind, the cost for treating each child is just as individual as that child’s circumstances. On average, however, a child receives 6 months of services, which breaks down to 1 hour of services per week—at 26 weeks and a cost of $150 per session, this comes out to approximately $4,000 per child in clinical services. 
 
 CII provides between $500,000 and $1,000,000 in ""uncompensated care"" to individuals ineligible for government programs, such as MediCal, each year. But there are still many children and family members who we are not able to comprehensively serve, due to a limited availability in funds.
 
 To cover additional costs, CII works to secure public funding because of its long-term sustainability. We have contracts for treating victims of Child Abuse and Neglect (California State), Community Mental Health (LA County), Early Education (Head Start), and Fatherhood programming (Federal). 
 
 CII also seeks private money to supplement its public contracts and to help the agency provide its Edge of Excellence, which allows CII to go above and beyond what standard contracts cover. Through this Edge, CII is able to offer the range of services that are so critical to helping a child recover and thrive. 
 
 CII also has a development department, dedicated to securing funding that sustains our agency and its programming. The department includes professionals who oversee individual, foundation, and corporate solicitation.","Personnel:
 Clinical Supervisor, 10% in program: $6,500
 Bilingual Therapist, 75% in program: $40,500

 Total Personnel: $63,200. 
 
 Fringe Benefits: $18,328
 Direct Allocations: $8,791
 Indirect Cost (Administrative Allocations): $9,681
 
 Total Costs: $100,000","CII developed a Business Plan for 2012-2017, laying out the agency’s vision for the future: To transform the lives of thousands of children who have been affected by violence or other Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) by helping them recover from trauma, build resiliency, and become ready for success in school, work, and life. 
 
 To carry out this vision, CII established three strategic imperatives:
 
 1. Scale up CII’s Integrated Services Model: At the end of 5 years, CII will fill the gaps in program services to ensure that double the number of children and families receive multiple (3+) coordinated services.
 
 2. Replicate the CII model in Watts: At the end of 5 years, CII will have replicated its Integrated Services Model in Watts and begun construction on a state-of-the-art facility that will reach 5,000 children and caregivers a year in CA’s highest-need community. 
 
 3. Expand research and training efforts to improve practice and influence policy: At the end of 5 years, CII will have developed and disseminated a body of evidence documenting the effectiveness of CII’s Integrated Services Model. 
 
 Through these imperatives, and with the support of funders like LA 2050, CII will expand its services to reach 25,000 children and caregivers a year. CII will also build a body of evidence on the effectiveness of the “whole child, entire family” model— which will contribute significantly to knowledge in the field. 
 
 To achieve this vision, CII will focus on building capacity in:
 Program and Organizational Management (specifically related to integrated service delivery, program performance, human resources, facilities, and program evaluation and measurement); Marketing, Communications, and Development (specifically related to external relations and fundraising capacity and planning for the Watts campaign); and Financial Management and Resources (specifically related to enhancing staff and systems to manage more complex and competitive contracts and business processes.) 
 
 CII is proud of the agency’s achievement in each of these three strategic imperatives thus far. 
 
 In September, CII achieved a milestone in Watts, unveiling plans for the future Campus, designed pro-bono by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. CII will continue evaluating our Model’s effectiveness at reducing the symptoms of Adverse Childhood Experiences and we will bring the most successful aspects of this proposal to Watts."

BUNCH Magazine is dedicated to bringing resources to creatives with the goal of increasing employment in creative fields and empowering makers and entrepreneurs in these industries.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Arts District, Downtown Los Angeles",Learn,"In order to make Los Angeles the best place to create by 2050, we propose BUNCHFEST, a 3 day festival dedicated to bringing workshops, panels and cultural celebrations to the entire city. 
 
 Los Angeles is a hub for culture, creativity and the arts however it is often thought of as the epicenter of frivolity. People look to New York for creativity and even up North to Seattle and The Bay Area for culture and the arts. How can it be that we live in the entertainment capital of the world, yet we are not seen as a place that cultivates creativity, curiosity, culture, or innovation? 
 
 What this means is that we lose amazing creators to other metropolitan cities. These creators are the people who stimulate our economy, the ones who revitalize our neighborhoods and ultimately the ones who bring beauty and culture to our city. We know because many of us who will be managing this project have left LA seeking greener pastures at some point in our careers.
 
 What we have noticed is that this growing creative class is not comprised of outliers but instead are the people driving the culture and the economy. We come in the form of techies, artists, entrepreneurs and more. There is a deep desire to learn and collaborate. We have hosted a series of free panels and workshops on how to master creative business the latest of which had nearly 350 people signed up to attend. To us, that signals an eagerness to innovate and create. 
 
 The aim of BUNCHFEST is to replicate that momentum on a larger scale and make it accessible to the masses. Making Los Angeles a leader in the arts and also exposing our residents to the various types of careers that are available in creative industries is our goal. Empowering creatives to build careers is the end goal. 
 
 BUNCHFEST will be a 3 day festival hosted in the summer of 2016 dedicated to the intersection of music, film and innovation. Attendees will be able to see independent films, listen to up-and-coming/established musicians, all while having the opportunity to attend workshops and panels on innovation and creative business. We want attendees to leave feeling whole: inspired to create, knowledgeable on how to bring their plans to fruition and empowered to pursue their professional endeavors. 
 
 We believe that The Arts District in Downtown Los Angeles is the best place to host an event like this. The energy of this neighborhood is unmatched.","Challenge: The biggest challenge will be ensuring that the ticket prices are affordable for attendees. We want as many people to be able to attend, learn and grow. Our objective is to charge a nominal fee for tickets so that we can turn a small profit. Profits will be put towards hosting free, smaller workshops and panels throughout the rest of the year in addition to hosting this event annually. 
 
 Solution: We plan to offset these costs - that would otherwise be passed along to attendees - by minimizing staffing fees and supplementing through sponsorship. Staffing costs can be reduced by allowing people to volunteer for positions in exchange for festival passes. We will also work aggressively to bring in sponsors to reduce the cost of tickets.","We will evaluate our work by measuring impact through:
 
 -Surveys administered throughout workshops and panels
 
 - Measure engagement through social media channels
 
 -Attendance rate
 
 - We will develop a focus group to attend the festival. We will track and monitor their progress throughout the year to understand how they have developed personally and professionally as it relates to their direct participation in the festival.","Northside Festival in Brooklyn is the closest example of an organization that is pushing out similar work. The festival celebrates film, technology, art and music over 8 days in Brooklyn and is put on by Northside Media, the publisher of Brooklyn Magazine and The L Magazine. We have a deep admiration for the impact that this festival has on the New York neighborhood. 
 
 Our distinguishing marker is that we will be more affordable and also execute on a smaller, more intimate scale. While our aim is to reach as many people as possible, Northside Festival can at times feel overwhelming, with hundreds of events taking place, many at the same time. Accessibility is our primary focus: by creating a curated experience with a schedule that offers opportunity instead of restriction. Seeing your favorite musician should not come at the expense of learning about digital marketing. Discussing personal branding as it relates to entering your film into festivals should not be sacrificed in order to experience a hands on craft workshop. Scheduling alone is not enough to guarantee a well rounded experience; it is truly about leaving people with inspiration and knowledge. BUNCHFEST embraces the idea of quality not quantity and will keep this at the forefront of our planning process.","Our partners will come directly from the community: the business owners, galleries, restaurants, co-working spaces, schools, council members & other public agents, volunteers, networking groups, non-profits and more. The support of these individuals and businesses is of paramount importance to our success. 
 
 There is no plan to directly share in the grant money with these partners, instead we will rely on them for their cooperation and collaboration in other ways such as helping to publicize the event.","We have estimated that this project will cost a minimum of $22,000 but will most likely top out at just under $50,000.

Through a variety of disciplines in the performing, visual, and culinary arts, C3 will encourage health and wellness through diverse programs that spark engagement and creativity. 
 
 EDUCATION
 C3 will feature programs designed for different age groups under each of the subject areas. Examples of these are music (Mommy & Me, music production), dance (stretching, yoga, and a variety of dance disciplines), visual arts (drawing, graphic design, ceramics), and culinary arts (nutrition, healthy cooking). 
 
 Additional classes and groups will also be offered based on the interests of volunteers and the identified needs of the community. For example, if parents are interested in forming support groups or play groups, the Center can provide a space for them. If qualified volunteers wish to provide classes in subjects they care about such as financial literacy, computer basics, or resume building, the Center can afford them the opportunity to do so.
 
 ENRICHMENT
 In addition, the Center will include a cafe and common area where people can congregate and connect. It will be a place where students can complete school work while waiting for classes to begin, parents can meet up to exchange advice and experiences, seniors can gather to socialize, and the community at large is welcome to come together. The cafe will also provide job opportunities and give students in the culinary arts classes the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience in food service and preparation.
 
 True to Culture Shock LA's passion for community service, the Center will also promote projects to support the local community. Planning service opportunities appropriate for all ages, C3 will bring together volunteers and engage them in activities that improve their neighborhoods. 
 
 ENTERTAIN
 C3 would be the community hub providing meeting space for community discussions, performances, and gatherings. Our goal is for the Center to be a safe space where, through the creative, connecting, and learning process, community members and leaders can improve their well-being and exchange ideas on how to create a vibrant Los Angeles.","Acquiring funds to sustain operations is our greatest anticipated challenge. We are creating strategies to address this issue that involve:
 
 - Utilizing skilled volunteers to provide some program instruction and professional services, as well as a work study volunteers to help with general day-to-day tasks.
 
 - Fundraising through events, grants, and solicitation of donations from corporations and individuals.
 
 - Creating earned income streams (cafe, venue rentals, contracts through community partnerships)","Programs and services will be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative data collected using thoughtfully designed participant surveys, attendance counts (daily visits, class enrollments, special events, service activities), and social media analytics.","While there are other community centers, dance/art studios, and organizations that offer public classes or meeting space for rent, there are none that offer the comprehensive array of multi-generational programs or the environment that we are proposing. Our project is unique in that we are striving to create a community/family environment in which people are encouraged to hang out, exchange ideas, and connect with one another. We want to truly be a part of the community; a center that engages with the neighborhoods around us and promotes dialogue and involvement. We want to make services accessible, creating a space where those with special needs or individuals experiencing economic hardships are also given the opportunity to participate. So many of the existing studios or centers currently offering similar programs do not have an inclusive approach. They focus primarily on maximizing fees for services and have created environments that move people in and out of the facility without allowing them time to connect with one another or develop a sense of community or togetherness.","Culture Shock LA will serve as project lead.

5102039,C5LA Alumni Support and College Persistence Program,2015024,,,"C5LA serves kids at high risk for school dropout due to poverty, precarious living circumstances, and prevalence of gangs in their neighborhoods. Our 5-year program of leadership camps, college/career prep, and service learning helps students realize their true potential. C5LA gets at-risk youth to college; however, many are unable to stay the course. Funding from LA2050 will enable C5LA to implement college retention initiatives for this vulnerable population to persist and succeed in college.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,None,"Making LA the best place to learn means that every high school student will graduate and be college and career ready. Making LA the best place to learn means turning current statistics upside down: during the 2013-2014 school year, 15,990 students in LA County dropped out of school. Of these students, an overwhelming 88% (14,089) were from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds (California Department of Education Reporting Office). 
 
 At C5LA, we are beating these odds at an astounding rate. For the past 15 years, 100% of our students have graduated high school and for the past 3 years, 100% of our students have gone to college or another post-secondary opportunity. 
 
 The purpose of C5LA is to serve students most at-risk for dropping out of school by providing them with hope for the future, life-changing experiences, and the skills needed to not only graduate high school, but to succeed in college and beyond. We are doing this with our innovative, outcome driven programming based on the belief that a comprehensive multi-year experience is vital in supporting this vulnerable population. Our success has been great with getting students to enter college, now we need to make sure they stay there, succeed, and complete their degree. 
 
 Nationwide, nearly one-third of college students drop out before their second year. Many factors contribute to the decision to drop out of college, including financial strain, stress, lack of engagement, and academic struggles, but having support from adults and peers can help students overcome these adversities. 
 
 We are confident that our program prepares youth well for many of the challenges they will face in college and beyond. Unfortunately, due to our limited resources and the intensive nature of our regular programming, we have not yet been able to systematically support and track the outcomes of C5LA alumni.
 
 Funding from LA2050 will support a natural expansion of our core programming to offer greater support to our alumni throughout their college experience. Supporting C5LA graduates through the sometimes difficult transition to college will improve the likelihood of graduating from college and achieving success as adults.
 
 To better support college persistence, we aim to implement the following initiatives in 2015-2016: 
 - Create a C5LA Grad 1st Year College Boot Camp 
 - Cultivate Strategic Partnerships with College Retention Experts 
 - Enhance Data Collection 
 - Expand Social Media Outreach
 - Alumni","While our program youth have spent five years building their academic skills and confidence, once they graduate from high school and enter college, the support system they had relied upon is greatly diminished. C5LA, at present, does not have the staffing capacity to provide support beyond high school. 
 
 C5LA has a very rigorous evaluation process for participants throughout the five-year program and up until high school graduation, but we currently do not have the systems or staffing capacity to track students and evaluate their progress once they leave our program. Seeking to build a continuum of support for our youth—the majority of whom are from very low-income households and the first in their families to attend college—funding from LA2050 would enable us to dedicate a Program Manager to track and fully evaluate the long-term impact of our programming on students, as well as to coordinate ongoing student support to ensure college retention and graduation.","Through the program expansion, we expect C5LA graduates to achieve an 80% first-year college persistence rate. 
 
 Specific information we plan to track includes: 
 • Matriculation data (four-year, two-year, vocational or career) 
 • Year over year college persistence rates
 • Participation in school groups and on-campus programs
 • Participation in C5LA events and Boot Camp sessions
 • C5LA peer-to-peer collaborations 
 • Alumni association participation and attendance 
 • Social media engagement
 • Challenges or issues interfering with college success and degree completion 
 
 Our process for tracking student data over time will include: oneone engagement with C5LA alumni, instituting a quarterly check-in process (during the five-year, pre-college program students do monthly check-ins), and a quarterly newsletter. Our success in building a robust evaluation initiative and college support program is contingent upon having dedicated staff who can coordinate these efforts consistently","C5LA works with organizations such as Educare, the Posse Foundation, Champions, Impact, and UCLA Uni-Camp to collaborate on serving more youth through our leadership programs. We are also partnered with the Fulfillment Fund and Princeton Review to enrich our college preparatory programming, including our youth participating in their standardized test taking prep classes and the Fulfillment Fund’s Destination College fair. 
 
 C5LA partners with 20 schools in the LAUSD through the Beyond the Bell Program, an initiative that provides afterschool enrichment opportunities for underserved youth. Because C5LA aims to prepare youth for college through programs like the Road to College, the agency has developed extensive partnerships with dozens of colleges and universities across the country. C5LA’s A.C.T. Now Summit enables students to spend a week on a local college campus designing and developing a day-long college access and awareness event for other at-risk students. C5LA youth deliver college preparatory presentations to hundreds of peers. 
 
 C5LA has also partnered with South Central Scholars in the creation of the “College Access Brain Trust,” which includes leadership from several key organizations, including the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship and the Magic Johnson Foundation. 
 
 C5LA maintains a complementary relationship with the above organizations as well as other youth-serving agencies in LA. There is a tremendous need for support services for at-risk youth throughout LA County and C5LA offers innovative programming with unique components, including: 1) our five-year, year round model; 2) our proprietary curriculum which was developed by a team of nationwide youth development experts and honed over the years by the staff; 3) our robust evaluation processes including third party entities; 4) our signature, residential summer experiences; and 5) adventure-based leadership development training in Wyoming and Washington and at sites around greater Los Angeles during the school year. 
 
 We ensure our collaborations are successful by:
 - Working closely with existing collaborative partners to further develop our program;
 - Seeking out relationships with college preparatory programs that have been proven effective; and
 - Constantly exploring how we can partner with new organizations that serve a similar youth demographic.","Part of our program expansion includes the development of strategic partnerships with college retention experts. The first several months of the grant, if awarded, will be dedicated to exploring who the key stakeholders are and conducting outreach. C5LA will begin reaching out to current partners such as the Southern California College Access Network and the Posse Foundation to leverage resources and identify best practices.","The total program budget is $140,000. In addition to funding in the amount of $100,000 from LA2050, $40,000 will be funded through support from other foundations. 
 
 $51,500 to Create a 1st Year College Boot Camp: The first few months of college can be overwhelming. To help smooth the transition from high school to college life, C5LA will host a weekend 1st Year College Summer Boot Camp. Beginning in 2016, sessions will include what students need to know, coping strategies, campus resources, and ways to connect with peers. 
 
 $46,000 to Enhance Data Collection: To understand factors contributing to college success or failure, we will develop and implement a rigorous data collection system. C5LA plans to use the National Student Clearinghouse to determine where C5LA students are now and to collect data on college enrollment. We are interested in capturing both quantitative and qualitative data along with anecdotal and social aspects of student progress. Due to the intensive work of following up on the students, finding out where they are, and understanding what barriers they may be facing, we would need an additional, dedicated staff member to accomplish this. 
 
 $42,500 to Support Alumni Association Initiatives: An important factor in C5LA’s success is the sense of belonging and ownership students take in their experience. Building upon the work we do through the Association, we will reach out to students via newsletters and social media to engage them and remind them that they are always part of the C5 family. C5LA will also host at least two events for college students per year (during the holidays and spring break).
 
 
 C5LA has a robust year-round fundraising campaign, and we currently receive grant support from the Morris and Mayer Kaplan Family Foundation ($50,000), the Ball Corporation ($25,000), Insperity ($5,000), Rose Hills Foundation ($50,000), Joseph Drown Foundation ($50,000), Weingart Foundation ($25,000), the Carl E.

Camp4All addresses the great need of homeless and at-risk children and teens and families living in LA-county-based shelters and transitional housing facilities to truly enjoy the feeling of being a child again- spending summer days at beautiful Zuma Beach in Malibu, CA, and experiencing a sense of relief, genuine emotional refreshment and feeling of renewed possibility- a truly invigorating and renewed sense of hope for the future. Families are also invited to attend- allowing for a truly incredible bonding experience, a “staycation” right in their own backyards! PLAY, in essence, is utilized as a means of connecting with their very best selves. This program was our very first program, and holds very special significance to us, as our three other program platforms grew out of the needs our original at-risk and homeless campers and initial homeless families through Camp4All. We have amazing Surf instructors who can actually get participants to stand up on the surfboard by the end of the day, have a great picnic lunch on the beach, and thoroughly enjoy the playground that is their own backyard in LA. In addition, we will have two overnight camps for the families and teens in our Vita Network- (which are families we have moved from homeless shelters and/or helped transform their lives through financial aid and domestic assistance.) Camp4All helps make LA the best place to play by showing its most at-risk citizens that ALL of LA is available to them- and can help change their lives in the process.","Challenges include, mainly, being able to accommodate a growing waiting list of future participants, This grant will also us to serve 500 more additional “campers” next year.","In the pas, we have evaluated this program both in-house and through the different participating agencies themselves. Metrics will include: Increase in self confidence, overcoming fear of the ocean/water, likelihood of returning with their family for a day outing and probability of picking up surfing again after the participants leave Camp4All.","As far as we know, the Children’s Lifesaving Foundation is one of the only NPO’s offering a recreational camp program to this very specific homeless population, and more specifically, focuses on the idea of refreshment and enrichment through play- through learning to surf. There are other great agencies that offer camps to at-risk youth, but CLF is targeting homeless families living as a unit on shelters, by far the most at-risk population in LA county, and one of the most under-served.","The agencies we offer Camp4All to are never charged a dime to participate, and we have been offering this highly reputable program since the summer of 1993. The Children’s Lifesaving Foundation offers Camp4All to shelters and agencies such as: Homeboy Industries, LA Mission, Union Rescue Mission, Covenant House, My Friend’s Place, Para Los Ninos, LA’s BEST, Urban Compass, and many others-all located in LA county.","Our current budget is $245,000, and we have funders who will help cover and match this grant from LA2050 this season.","Nutrition/Meals: $22,500

5102286,Caregiver and Me: Get Healthy with Sesame Street,2016204,,", 951690975, 450532426,","The “Caregiver and Me: Get Healthy with Sesame Street” pilot project is an innovative learning experience addressing the childhood obesity epidemic in Los Angeles County by targeting family, friend and neighbor child caregivers in areas with obesity rates of 30% or higher. This is a collaborative effort with community and government organizations familiar with the critical need and challenges of engaging the family, friend and neighbor community caring for an estimated 97,000 children in LA.",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0Create0Live,"We will make LA the Healthiest place to live by changing the trajectory of children’s health in targeted high need areas. Instilling healthy habits in children of LA County in 2016 is growing the healthy adults of 2050. How? By providing an educational opportunity targeting the Family, Friend and Neighbor (FFN) child caregiver that challenges the status quo. The Lucille & David Packard Foundation released a 3 dimensional report regarding FFN caregivers to encourage rethinking how we attempt to engage and educate them. According to The Early Care and Education Landscape in LA County Report, this community is caring for 97,000 children as they develop 90% of their brain from ages 0-5. These children are spending a great deal of time, during their most formative and vulnerable years, with individuals who are not required to (and generally do not) participate in educational trainings for any aspect of early childhood development, including health and wellness. Grandparents and other FFN caregivers are unknowingly contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic by not understanding the crucial role they play in a child’s growth and development. There are 11 areas in LA County with childhood obesity rates at 30% or higher and these are the areas we are going to target.
 
 Messaging, branding, location, language, activities, training leaders and style of training must be tailored to this audience to impact all aspects of early education including healthy habits.
 
 This class will be using a successful “mommy & me” model in an innovative way. Sesame Street materials create a familiar and common ground for leader, participants and children. Sharing information about physical activity, healthy cooking and purchasing healthful foods on a budget will feel like a fun outing with the children and not a “training” for the professional caregiver. Including the children in the learning event will also empower the caregiver to do these things in her home as he/she has already experienced how to do it WITH the children.
 
 Another innovative highlight to this project is using a successful model of leadership cultivations that Magnolia Place implemented with an FFN reading club project. Trust is cited time and again as the crux of a successful project in this community therefore the leaders of our classes will be individuals from the FFN community not only establishing a trusting environment during the class but cultivating leaders within the community.","Problem: Recruiting Attendees. 
 Strategy: Messaging, branding, location, language, activities, training leaders and style of training will be tailored to this audience’s needs and interests. We are also partnering with community based organizations that have established connections and networks to FFN caregivers including the Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles and Magnolia Place. May want to mention incentivizing the workshops - not sure if you need to mention the specifics of offering food, gift cards, or bus tokens. 
 
 Problem: Finding and Cultivating Leaders for the Classes. 
 Strategy: work with community based organizations such as Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, Magnolia Place and Best Start Locations to get recommendations of who we can reach out to as well as put out a call to the community through these channels.
 
 Problem: Incentives for Attendance
 Strategy: We will be incentivizing with food at location, providing child care, a physical activity kit, gift cards et","In an effort to determine the success and adjustments necessary regarding this pilot project, we will create an evaluation tool - two surveys - to be taken before and after the class. One will be directed toward what brought them to the class, how they got there, if there were any barriers they had to remove in order to attend and what expectations they have for the class. This will help us assess what part of the recruiting and outreach process worked best as well as determine if we accurately set expectations for the experience. The second survey will help us determine the success of the class itself - format and style, materials, location, environment, class leader and will help us determine if they would recommend it to other community members, if they would come to another class style like this on another topic and if they would want to always keep it with the same leader and group or if signing up for a random class provided is attractive option.","There are other organizations doing similar work. Some focusing on child care and obesity prevention such as Choose Health LA Child Care, an obesity prevention program funded by First 5 LA and managed by Los Angeles Department of Public Health and Taking Healthy Steps to Success – LA County which is an early learning collaborative funded by Nemours. There are additional initiatives focusing on Family, Friend and Neighbor (FFN) care as well as parent engagement all meant to positively impact children in LA County. The Unique Factor: We are building on lessons learned from the Choose Health LA Child Care Project, research done by the Packard Foundation published in June 2015 and listening to those who have been in the community share achievements and barriers to successful programming. We are removing known barriers upfront: children are invited, location will be convenient and familiar, the materials and class will be familiar - Sesame Street - in either spanish or english, incentives will be given and the class will be lead by a trusted person from the community. Throughout research and conversations with stakeholders in the FFN community trust is an element that continues to take precedence. Our unique caregiver & me format combined with Sesame Street materials, trust from from the community and the expertise of surrounding organizations set this project apart from current initiatives.","Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH) is a collaborative partner providing technical assistance and resources as needed. They will not receive grant funds.
 
 Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles will receive $25,000 to design the 1.5 hour class, Develop the 1.5 hour training based on the 3 Sesame Street Materials; “Mommy and Me”format, Conduct 12 trainings over the course of 1 year; Recruit FFN providers in partnership with our R&R’s (mailings, email blasts, phone calls), coordinate and host training (including food) at a local community center (Library, Parks and Rec Center, etc.), Provide child care and provide incentive materials - Physical Activity Kit
 
 Magnolia Place (Children's Bureau) will receive $15,000 to work with their existing network and additional channels of Family, Friend and Neighbor Caregivers.

Showing not only how the overall program was set up and administered but how the different groups of people throughout the license exempt community responded to it. The goal is to make it easy for other agencies to easily replicate the efforts and learn from our lessons for a successful license exempt outreach plan and class format.
 
 There are many changes coming to the child care world through the new federal and state regulations after the Child Care Development Block Grant was signed into law. One of these big changes is required 10 health and safety trainings. It is imperative agencies intending to train the license exempt providers receiving subsidies know how to engage this notoriously isolated group of people in a learning opportunities.
 
 Children 0-5 are in the care of family members or friends, most likely their grandparents. These caregivers know how they raised their children and their cultural preferences. They are not taking into consideration the impact they are having on the child’s weight, nutrient intake and brain development. This set of caregivers need an additional support system and messaging directed just to them. They are family members and see themselves as such, not as babysitters, caregivers, providers or teachers. Therefore, we will also reach out to organizations such as Generations United, AARP and other Grandfamilies organizations to consider what a partnership might look like to provide the class throughout these networks.
 
 The website with all of the information and how to replicate these efforts will be maintained so the general public will always have access to the white paper, lessons learned and ways to replicate what we accomplished."

 Lacking healthy food access, missing basic amenities and the real estate gold rush along the LA River have left modest neighborhoods without economic development drivers. As our LA River Cafe project proved, pop-up to permanent cottage businesses can meet the needs for jobs, healthy alternatives and locally operated small businesses.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,The Los Angeles River adjacent communities lacking basic services,0Create0Live,"It is odd that with the great interest in the LA River Revitalization, private development far outpaces economic development in transitional and affluent neighborhoods alike. With riverfront property trading at above market prices, with no clear urban planning directive, and with a R.I.O. design guidelines no nearer to completion, river adjacent neighborhoods are suffering from a lack of input in how to create sustainable eco-systems. 
 
 But another study of the LA River is not needed, another forum or awards ceremony brings us no closer to revitalization. It is a 20 to 30 year wait for bond money, EIFD's, or federal funds to transform the concrete channel and provide park lands. Meanwhile, 5 story stucco boxes are breaking ground today, causing grief and a profound fear of displacement. 
 
 It is time for socially aware projects and people to pop-up and claim their own destiny. 
 
 River Wild has found, by deep involvement with LA River neighborhoods, streets, and by listening to residents, that the lack of basic ""complete neighborhood"" amenities (such as transportation, jobs, housing and retail) have left communities without the benefits that smart economic development and planning could provide. 
 
 In Elysian Valley we see a shrinking creative arts job base, fleeing manufacturing, and zero access to healthy food. However, Elysian Valley was once the breadbasket of Los Angeles, with 4 bakeries that provided hundreds of jobs that Frogtown residents could walk to from home. 
 
 As our LA River Cafe project proved, pop-up to permanent cottage businesses can create local jobs, provide healthy alternatives and create locally operated small businesses that meet the needs of long time residents and hipsters. No study, no forum, just proof of concept models erected in empty buildings along the LA River. 
 
 It is our intent to take an empty grocery store that survived floods, displacement, crime waves and a fast food epidemic and transform it into a healthy grocery Co-Op. This pilot project can be duplicated in other underserved communities without access to fresh, healthy food. Corner groceries are a essential for new residential developments planned and built without a walkable commercial corridor nearby. Pop-Up Economic Development, we propose, is where the wealth and health of any LA River neighborhood can spring from; not from wealth created by real estate development.
 
 Here is a conceptual walk thru video.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4-T6LELKTU","Being accused of gentrification in Latino communities suspicious of any change or new development. 
 
 River Wild has spent 5 years cultivating a local reputation in Elysian Valley, Atwater Village and Lincoln Heights - three LA River communities, each lacking a healthy grocery alternative and each with empty storefronts in strategic locations. 
 
 The variety of income and demographics is telling us our community based economic development model has potential for growth and investment up and down the LA River.
 
 We listen well. This might be our greatest advantage. Recognizing our collective tendency to contribute, we are in constant ""absorption"" mode. Walking the River, visiting business owners, meeting with residents is always informative.","Metrics are gold but Listening is Platinum. Proving every penny spent went to a positive community outcome is the first priority. Profitability is second, due to the cooperative nature of this enterprise. We look for individual and collaborative impact in how residents, river tourists and local institutions will use and adopt to a local grocery after decades without one.
 
 We plan on keeping extensive accounting and paying to set up software to track procurement and sales and hire an accountant for quarterly audits. Even in an 800 square foot grocery, we think that careful tracking of cash flow, re-evaluation of inventory, price point creation through community outreach and surveys are essential.
 
 The creative leasing strategy affords us with a 3 month start-up period and a subsidized rent-free period to construct, create and modify with less stress.
 
 We are interviewing Co-op groups on national and regional scales, to find the best supply of goods that are not grown in Frogtown.","Public Matters' Market Makeover Program, the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, LA Food Policy Council, Compra (LURN), LA Kitchen are all great organizations doing similar work and we draw inspiration from these groups and are collaborating with them, so a complementary approach is key. 
 
 Whereas these aforementioned organizations adhere to policy initiatives, rely on longer range planning, and conduct workshops to create programs, River Wild, by nature, goes directly to proof of concept with their brand of low cost pop-up project. This community co-op is a chance to build a healthy grocery co-op immediately in a neighborhood that has lacked a basic grocery for over 30 years. 
 
 River Wild is about relationship building. We have a great productive relationship with Councilman O'Farrell's office, work with River non-profits and city river organizations. Their willingness to participate in our economic development projects is a testament to our unique judo skills.
 
 Another advantage is that we go straight to a demonstration project. We created a pop-up health fair because a nurse told us that each neighborhood has an LA County Health Department staff assigned to it. We invited them after a 15 year hiatus and created the event around them. https://youtu.be/RnUr_qG3VkI
 
 We have a willing landlord, a food desert scenario, a largely Latino neighborhood, a low walking index, a moderate income community, a supportive councilman, and a renewed, although unfunded interest in the LA River. 
 
 The River Wild co-founders each have backgrounds in urban planning, architecture, community development, labor and small sustainable food business start-ups.
 
 These are stand-out factors will contribute to this unique grass roots approach.","River Wild is collaborating already on the LA2050 Listens grant to lay important outreach and conduct the first workshop for the Co-op in our October 11th Pop-Up Community Dinner called ""Growing a Healthy Food Economy in Elysian Valley. 
 
 Our collaboration from the LA2050 Listens event will ideally continue beyond if we land the challenge grant. 
 
 LA Food Policy Council, The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, 2 community gardens, Farm LA, the Elysian Valley Neighborhood Watch, Public Matters, St Anne's Church, Partners of Dorris Elementary School, Kruegermann's Pickles and Cafecito Organico are some of the collaborators in this endeavor. 
 
 Public Matters could receive $8,000 to do outreach in local schools. St. Anne's Church and Partners of Dorris Elementary School would receive a Co-op sponsored ""Pay it forward"" grant to invest in nutritional education at these two neighborhood institutions. 
 
 No other collaborator has been identified as requiring payment, especially the foundations and non-profits. 
 
 Our business model is to invest in local micro businesses to procure fresh produce, prepared foods and locally made dry goods, so there is a partnership there, of course.","The entire Grocery Co-Op will cost $135,000 - $175,000. We have interviewed with the www.fundrise.com, a crowdsource site which offers creative business model for a neighborhood to invest in a retail development. This affords Elysian Valley residents a pride of ownership or ""stock"" in seeing the Grocery thrive. 
 
 Cal-FreshWorks is offering Technical Assistance. River Wild began applying for Opportunity Fund's low interest loans. The LA Food Policy Council has offered us a Kiva Zip loan and the LURN network is offering a membership in its Compra buying collective for small grocers and River Wild will inquire into their micro-financing program as well.
 
 Healthy Neighborhood Markets Network has ""adopted"" our project and they see an opportunity to create a ground-up model. We would likely also open up a ioby.org or an Indiegogo campaign to complement the ""lasagna"" financing for this business model. 
 
 We are also investing our own privately sourced funds to show we have skin in the game. 
 
 The most conventional of other opportunities for financing would be to apply for a small business loan for working capital. It should be noted that the Lopez family (owner of the empty grocery store) are in negotiations with River Wild to secure a 3 year lease. 
 
 This LA2050 Challenge grant funding would not be used for rent, but capital improvements, outreach, labor and related expenses.","The LA River Co-op Budget:

 We can't wait to use our extensive social media network and do old-fashioned door to door outreach. We will be both low-tech and high tech during our get out the vote step.
 
 In addition, the Co-op will create a more walkable neighborhood (currently a 38 on the index -- we want that number to be 83). It will reduce care use (elderly residents do not have cars and public buses are infrequent). 
 
 Moreover, more households share a single car and the Co-op reduces carbon footprints by sourcing local goods to sell at the store. 
 
 Pop-ups are low-cost ways of testing business and urban plans. As our videos show (https://youtu.be/6wb0g2teozc) we let the physical project inform our hypothesis. 
 
 We film all our events to share our progress, for it is the process that teaches us, not necessarily the end-product. We always create information graphics and maps for events that are useful after events, and make a lot of our content available on our various media outlets. We will be a food hub where people can check in daily to find out if there are local foods coming into the exchange. 
 
 We believe that this type of open sourcing and transparency help promote our community building philosophy. 
 
 We excel at extending budgets and creating tight collaborations so that budgets get more ""bang for the buck"". The multi layered and aligned programming allows more than one organization to claim success from our work.
 
 Each day we stock our Co-op, sell a locally grown apple, or have a conversation with a happy, elderly neighbor will be immensely gratifying on a human level. For the fulfillment of the LA2050 Challenge grant goals, we feel that with such great resources offered by our collaborators, through our intensive studies of local history, and through street level interviews with neighbors and naysayers, we will succeed in spades. 
 
 We pride ourselves on immediate impact that is sometimes temporal, but always constructive and experiential, not just filed in a report that sits on a shelf. 
 
 Lastly, we believe that any LA River project needs to be accessible to all people, races, economic backgrounds. We have been focusing on basic services, not high-end boutique that marginalizes long time residents. The bigger the customer base, the greater chance at success."

CHIME’s Multimedia Multiplied Program is designed to flip the script by training, equipping and empowering youth living within these communities to create their own images. 
 
 CHIME is the tool, which will create an Economic ripple effect and forge the youth accessibility to skills and opportunities not readily available to them – tools that will render an outlet creating jobs and career opportunities. Even beyond employment, we hope to provide students with the knowledge and skills to start their own companies and be their own boss!
 
 CHIME, a Multimedia Multiplied Program, initially began seven years ago with two K-8 schools within Los Angeles Unified School District. It did not, at the time, receive much support – teaching such complicated technology and technique to 3rd, 4th, 5th graders, even kindergarteners, did not seem plausible to most. The after school Program succeeded – students are thriving, learning and growing – and it is now offered in over 146 schools in LAUSD. The films they are creating cover a wide range of subject matters – bullying, the environment the latest news, etc. Additionally, Heart and Soul works with troubled teenagers; and, through this Program, they learn new skills, and find a productive and alternative outlet for their voice. A constructive and encouraging atmosphere combined with proper training and guidance will render an environment conducive to young minds discovering their potential and voice.
 
 CHIME has been implemented in Detroit, MI – a strong city who is fighting (and winning) to rebuild itself. We collaborated with The Multicultural Youth Leadership Event (MYLE) to train their staff and youth in multimedia equipment and technology. MYLE is part of a larger group, The ELCA Youth Gathering, and their event in 2015 will be 40,000 youths strong. The team we built was an integral part of filming and interviewing this event!
 
 Los Angeles is a multicultural haven; and CHIME will bridge the gap between the distinct cultures to create a conduit in which youth, from ten diverse parts of LA, can learn from and connect with each other – as a result, create, work, play and live together.","Los Angeles is a world famous city know for its golden coast, fair climate, Beverly Hills, Hollywood and the city in which dreams come true. But the reality is opportunities are not evenly and fairly offered to everyone equally. The image of under-served communities, as perpetrated by the media, is mostly negative focusing on poverty, crimes and gangs. CHIME is specifically designed to tackle these images. Everybody – the media, politicians, educators and pundits – seems to have an opinion. We at Heart & Soul Design Communications Center have an opinion as well – the youth have a voice and it needs to be heard.
 
 One of the biggest challenges of our society is stereotyping. A child, a youth, should not be labeled and their opportunities should not be hindered to live up or down to a stereotype. The leaders of tomorrow must learn to live, understand, work and play together now. There is no better method to attain tolerance than to interact and work together.","At the end of Program, there will be a culmination event, in which the completed work of all students will be shared with parents, peers, educators and community. In addition their work will be featured on local media, Heart & Soul’s website, social media and You Tube. Each student will also take home a copy of the work they’ve created.
 
 Everyone – staff, board, teachers, parents & students – will evaluate the CHIUME in addition to reaping the rewards. We will promote the Program by broadcasting on local media (cable access), the internet and other outlets. New positive images… New stories told… New economic and educational empowerment. The results will be captured on video, audio recorded, & print, writing and photography.
 
 The students will gain a new understanding of themselves and each other and will be more conscientious leaders of tomorrow, thus benefiting their community and our City. We can compare what we have done in multimedia for the under-served to any organization in US.","Although there are other organizations which provide multimedia training for youth, their program is either not affordable for students in under-served communities and/or it is not as thorough and cohesive as Heart and Soul’s CHIME Program.
 
 HAS has over 35 years experience working with youth, including collaborating with and providing Los Angeles Unified School District (through their Youth Development Program), Inglewood Unified School District multimedia programs and technology, UCLA, USC, Children’s Defense Fund, etc. Earlier this year, CHIME was successfully implemented in Detroit – a diverse and distinct city with a rich history – a city that has faced and continues to face challenges. Heart & Soul coaches have built studios from Los Angeles, CA to Brooklyn, NY.
 
 The 21st Century is a rapidly growing technology based society. Students of today who will become citizens of tomorrow will need to be technologically literate to successfully enter the information age. Our multimedia staff teaches the latest multimedia technology tools through lessons and hands-on experience. Students learn a variety of communication methods from qualified instructors who work in the media industry, offering each pupil the opportunity to work with a professional mentor. The instructors for each multimedia program teach students how to develop their creative writing, presentation & storytelling skills; to visualize and execute their creative concepts; and develop appropriate work ethic in a team dynamic. But, our most valuable lesson is ACT – Attitude, Commitment and Teamwork. This benchmark is the foundation of our program. If students can learn to ACT right, they will be successful in any field they choose in life.
 
 Heart and Soul’s intent is to inspire constructive conversation among local teens throughout the city. The Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan’s revolutionary insights changed the way everyone thought about media, technology and communications. McLuhan’s phrase “global village” highlighted his observation that an electronic nervous system (the media) was integrating the planet. Heart & Soul believes that the voices of youth in underprivileged and under-served communities are not part of this global community due to lack of funding and available technology. We want to rectify this problem and bring the youth in our community into the 21st century technology. Our uniquely innovative program is designed to empower, position and give wings to the youth.","Heart and Soul has decades of experience working and collaborating with schools, non-profit organizations and communities at large.
 
 If chosen, we will select a total of ten K through 8th grade schools – one school in each of the following areas: Compton, Lynwood, Gardena, Inglewood, Hawthorne, El Segundo, Venice, Lennox, Carson and Long Beach. CHIME After School Program will take place at each school, from 3 to 6 pm, twelve weeks per semester (total of twenty-four weeks). Twenty students, per school, can participate. They will be required to work on projects individually, collectively as a school and, through distance learning, with students at other schools. The goal of working with the students in other schools directly is to create opportunities for them to interact with and learn from each other. Periodically, they will work on their group projects from our studio space in Inglewood.
 
 There are no prerequisites, but each youth needs to make a commitment to the Program and be enrolled in one of the selected schools. Furthermore, the principal and one teacher from each school will be involved as well. Lastly, we will involve the parents of each student. In short, we will collaborate with the community!
 
 The young people in this program will come from all sections of life, especially under-served communities. Every young person has a need to feel included, needed, productive and valued, in order to feel life is worthwhile – the more diverse, the better!","Heart and Soul has extensive knowledge of and experience in creating and implementing after school programs. The CHIME Program, as proposed and outlined above, will cost $100,000.","CHIME Project Budget:

The success will be determined by the community – students, parents, school representatives and the public. We have seen the success of this Program and are confident it will grow on its own merit."
5102055,CicLAvia: The Route to LA’s Future,2018021,,,"CicLAvia 2016 will expand its open streets program by integrating iconic routes with new ones: Southeast Cities; Northeast San Fernando Valley; the Heart of LA, and Wilshire Blvd. By blending the old with the new, car-free Angelenos can bear witness to social, cultural and economic renaissances happening from one neighborhood to the next. The opportunity to see Los Angeles, up close and personal vs. in a car and through the rear view mirror, redefines the meaning of connection.",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,"Southeast Cities – Huntington Park, South Gate, Lynwood, Florence/Firestone & Walnut Park; Northeast San Fernando Valley - Pacoima, Panorama City, Arleta, & North Hills; Downtown Los Angeles, Wilshire Center, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Boyle Heights",ALL,"On the thousands of miles of road we travel by car everyday, we connect to Los Angeles via destination points, from point A to point B. CicLAvia shows us what we miss in between those points. CicLAvia presents an almost still photograph of our city and allows us to focus and engage with our built environment and with each other. In essence, we self-propel through our streets using our body’s inertia as pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboarders, roller skaters and other non-motorized forms of movement. There are no windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine. Instead, it is replaced by the ambient noise of footsteps pounding, skateboards running, bicycle wheels spinning, gears shifting, chains rubbing, horns and whistles sounding, and conversations continuing. We become open to exploring old and new neighborhoods in the safety of a car-free environment, thus rediscovering our city and region as newly-engaged participants.
 
 Initiated in 2010, CicLAvia is now a major force in transforming attitudes and lifestyle behaviors regarding health, civic engagement, active transportation and the environment. These free open-street events have changed the conversation and are now having a direct impact on related local policy issues. As we complete our fifth year and fifteenth event, we remain enthralled by the stories that CicLAvia tells about our city and region. We are a region of more than 10 million people, and a city that spans more than 465 square miles. But four times a year, CicLAvia makes us feel that our city is small enough to explore in one fell swoop. LA is still relatively young, but we have wise souls willing to share experiences and secret treasures.","Our major challenge lies in the financial support necessary to deliver future CicLAvias to a level surpassing past events to encourage the participation of more Angelenos and to create new memories and experiences for attendees. Our strategy to overcome this obstacle is to diversify our funding base through extensive campaigns dedicated to corporate giving as well as foundation and government grants. The primary emphasis will be on individual engagement. CicLAvia will expand its individual donor base by encouraging more engagement from event participants who become more empowered at each event as stakeholders in the sustainability of CicLAvia. It is our goal to double individual donations every year for the next five years to reach 25% of our annual budget.
 
 CicLAvia will continue its commitment to working with Metro & SCAG to expand financial and policy support of open streets events in Los Angeles County to create more active transportation projects.","CicLAvia will evaluate impact on:
 
  - Public space CicLAvia creates for people to connect
  - Physical activity increase compared with a normal Sunday (surveys on site)
  - Reduction in crime levels (LAPD stats comparing non-CicLAvia days)
  - Behavior change towards the use of active transportation (surveys on site and after event)
  - Increase in pedestrian and bike use (data from public agency counts)
  - Direct impact on local policy changes on active transportation (implementation of local and regional mobility plans)
  - Number of participants at CicLAvia and track increase in social media penetration using key platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)","Across the country, open streets events are growing in number since CicLAvia began in 2010. Large cities like NYC, San Francisco and Atlanta have events. But since 2010, CicLAvia has grown into a recognized national model because of its collaborative approach, scale and impact on both the city and the region. CicLAvia begins with safety, collaboration and outreach with public officials, the local community, community institutions/organizations, and business owners. Extensive community outreach occurs prior to each event, and the outcomes inform the experiences on each route. Each CicLAvia is about celebrating culture, people and each route weaves a new place from whole cloth into the city’s fabric. As Adam Leipzig states in Cultural Weekly in April 2014, “CicLAvia creates the feeling of discovery because it’s organizers constantly change its route, and because participants approach it alone on bicycles, then suddenly, in turning one corner, discover they are a part of a vast collective enterprise. This is one way that creative culture moves and spreads – through the emotions of anticipation and discovery. It’s the Law of Discovery, and CicLAvia illustrates it on city streets for all to see.”
 
 CicLAvia is also about changing the public conversation of our built environment, and how we interact with it. The experiences at CicLAvia inform public policy shifts at all levels of local and regional governance. Key city and regional agencies have launched efforts to support active transportation – with METRO open streets initiative and LA’s Mobility Plan 2035. 
 
 CicLAvia has changed attitudes about the car culture of Los Angeles by shifting the perceptions and attitudes of local stakeholders who affect local transportation and environmental policies and the design of our streets. A shift towards a commitment to safety with a focus on serving the most vulnerable users including children, seniors, persons with disabilities and transit-dependent populations, will make streets safe for all users.","The $100,000 LA2050 grant is designated to CicLAvia’s support planning and implementing of four events in 2016. The LA2050 grant will help support the infrastructure costs, such as tent and booth expenses at the hubs and along the route associated with first aid, bike repair, and community information for community organizational partners and local agencies. Additionally, the grant will help support the organizing of over 2200 volunteers involved in every aspect of CicLAvia production, including work prior to, during and after the event. They assist in community and business outreach; providing safe crossing during the event; staffing of information booths; and serve as general ambassadors of goodwill. 
 
 CicLAvia partners with all relevant city and county agencies, including Transportation, Cultural Affairs, LAPD, LADWP, Fire, and others who provide the public services for the route. Outreach and programming of CicLAvia involves partnerships with community organizations, local religious institutions, and business owners to enhance the experiences on the routes.

In order to deliver more CicLAvias to different parts of the region, it will require active engagement of new communities and new cities, and key local and regional stakeholders. As in past CicLAvias, we will continue to document and share the environmental, social and economic benefits of open streets events. We are confident that the measurement of impact through metrics and evaluation could encourage more CicLAvia events more often and in more places. We do this by:
 
 - Measuring the improvement in air quality when alternative modes of transportation are used;
 - Documenting the creation of temporary open space and recreation opportunities created by opening up streets to pedestrians and bicyclists;
 - Showing the positive local economic benefits as a results of CicLAvia during the day of, and weeks after the event with new customers;
 - Continuing to focus resources on public safety on the route for participants;
 - Streamlining the production costs to capitalize on economies of scale.
 
 Since 2010, the success of CicLAvia has resonated not only across the region, but also throughout the country. Open streets events have taken place in many of the country’s urban and rural cities, and CicLAvia has been the national model. While CicLAvia events are often measured by the number of participants, the success of the events will be strengthened by the overall positive impacts on our quality of life. CicLAvia improves air quality and increases the benefits to the local economy. It reinforces positive change in local and regional alternative transportation policies, and encourages conversation in creating new open space. And CicLAvia brings communities closer and makes people more connected to each other."
5102132,City with a Heart of Art: 1000 New Artworks made in & by LA in 2016,2015085,,,"The Heart of Art Gallery proposes: 1000 New Artworks made in & by LA in 2016!
 
 With a grant of...
 
 100,000 dollars, we will outreach to the over 
 
 10,000 women, youth and LGBTQIA artists in LA, to ask them to help produce
 
 1,000 new works of art in 2016, to exhibit at one or more of our 
 
 100 community art events during the year, and continue our outreach at at least
 
 10 university events, all by rebuilding our 
 
 1 Heart of Art gallery.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"South Central LA, Exposition Park area",ALL,"The Heart of Art Gallery has existed in South/Central LA for four years thanks to the passion and pocketbooks of founders Kenia Gutierrez and Bell Diaz, and donations by our artists. Our mission is to provide a safe space to create. We have seen thousands of artists create, show and perform in our space, yet we are the only space in our part of the city that allows this creativity. 
 
 Heart of Art has exists independently, employing and engaging some of the most marginalized and talented artists in Los Angeles. The majority of our artists are women and queer people of color, and our venue in South Central Los Angeles provides an oasis of support and opportunity for them to create, highlight their work and cultivate their skills. 
 
 Unfortunately, this fall our gallery became a target of a series of anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman attacks and has been forced to close our doors for the time being. If anywhere in LA needs funding for art and greater opportunities to create in this city, it’s the threatened queer community of artists in South Central Los Angeles. 
  
 Outside funding would allow us to relocate to a safe space, reopen our doors, and create an even bigger impact on the LA LGBTQIA community. 
 
 Out of our 1 new physical location made possible by this grant, in 2016 we will execute 10 university visit events throughout So.CA, and hold at least 100 gallery community art events, featuring 1,000 NEW pieces of art, created by the over 10,000 women, youth & LGBTQIA artists of LA, all made possible by your generous grant funding of $100,000.
 
 While many galleries look for experience and resumes from a particular class of artists, Heart of Art hosts artists at every level. While art school can be expensive for many artists in our community, we provide a space for shared community learning and exchange of tools and skills. While many artists give up before they begin, we encourage them to keep trying. The testimonials you'll see in our video attest to how challenging it can be to not be able to afford art school or hanging fees, or simply to make art that no one seems to want to see. By inviting experienced, or first time artists to exhibit at a show, or perform, we give every artist a chance, a reason to stay and CREATE in LA, and a reason to keep going. 
 
 We know from experience that art saves lives, especially for the people in our community, who so often struggle with shame and silence related to mental illness and membership in the LGBTQIA community.","At the time of this proposal writing, we are only two days away from closing our Rodeo Rd location forever. On August 29th, at what would turn out to be our last event, our community was attacked. Two men arrived and began intimidating our attendees with homophobic and sexist slurs. Bell and Kenia (owner/founders of HOA), ushered all guests inside, called the LAPD and barricaded the doors. Unfortunately this incident, like others we have experienced, only underlines why a space like this needs to exist.
 
 We anticipate this challenge will continue, as we intend to stay in the parts of LA where we are most needed. But our new location will provide our strategy for overcoming these obstacles; by reopening in a location with secure parking for vehicles and bikes, we can be sure that our attendees will be safe. Our risk reduction plan will be in place to create stronger security measures, and we hope to build relationships with local businesses to create a network of safety and support.","Art is not easy to evaluate. As something that is famous for being subjective and whose quality is left up to the eye of the beholder, we propose a quantitative approach to evaluating our works in Los Angeles in 2016. As stated above, our approach will be to simply count the art: 
 
 1 location, 10 college visits, 100 public events, 1000 new pieces of art made in LA, 10,000 artists encouraged, all from your $100,000.
 
 We will keep a public calendar on our website tallying our events, our total artists reached, and new art made. Our incredible network of LA artists is ready for this challenge and our community grows every day with new attendees at events, people we meet through our campus outreach and people who find us through social media and our website. By asking them to participate in our challenge by helping to create 1,000 new individual art works, we will achieve a thriving community with a common purpose, to make LA the best place to create!","There really is no place like Heart of Art Gallery in the world, much less in Los Angeles. Although there are many independent galleries, boutiques and state funded LGBTQ organizations in LA, none offer the specific combination of encouragement, inspiration, healing and creative power that Heart of Art has to offer.
 
 Heart of Art is something special. The following is a testimonial from one of our artists to this effect:
 
 ""As an un-art schooled artist trying to make it in LA, I know first hand how daunting it can be to try to find a place to show your work or to perform, and how this can be a difficult place to create. After two years of sending out hundreds of resumes, applications, inquiries, cold calls and submissions, and receiving nothing positive or no response at all, my spirit was crushed. But one day a friend sent me an article about Heart of Art Gallery on a local LA blog, so I tentatively emailed Bell and Kenia and begged them for a meeting. To my great astonishment, they actually replied to my email, and even invited me to participate in their next show. It may seem trivial to be invited into a creative community, but to me, and to so many others, that invitation changed my life.""
 
 Heart of Art is a unique gem of Yes in a landscape of No, and nothing compares to what they give to LA.
 
 Heart of Art Gallery is alone in what they do for LA. Heart of Art is more than just a gallery. A completely unfiltered, raw space for creatives to express. Heart of Art is a gallery one night, a drag show, the next morning, an art marketing workshop seminar that afternoon, a punk music hip hop venue for dinner, and a slam poetry reading room the next day. It is a place to create, a place to learn or take workshops in both artistic and in self defense skills. Heart of Art is an animal rescue program that seeks to comfort humans who have undergone traumatic and stressful life events with companionship. We are activists against the genocide of our sisters in Juarez, and for the advocacy of our trans siblings everywhere. Heart of Art is a place to confide and trust in others and find reassurance. We are a home for artists of all types, where people can dress and act as they feel most comfortable, without fear of censure. We are a place to create, freely and queerly, and for many in our community, we’re the only space they’ve ever had to feel free.","Heart of Art Gallery has no official partners or collaborators on this proposal, or in general. Although we are not adverse to working with another group, our organization is currently working alone. 100% of the grant winnings will be used by the Heart of Art Gallery in 2016 to further our mission to provide a safe place to create in LA.","With a budget of $100,000, our proposal has crafted a detailed budget with 2 options for our new gallery location: options to either buy or rent a new home for the gallery. 
 
 Location Option A, our preferred option to purchase, is just above the winnings at $108,300. Option B, the option to lease, is slightly more conservative and will use exactly the amount of the grant winnings: $100,000. If it turns out that this grant is non-taxable, then Option A will be estimated at $98,000 and Option B estimated at $89,700.
 
 Since our gallery’s forced closure this September, we are starting over from scratch. Our gofundme campaign is working, and although we are extremely grateful to those who have donated, it seems unlikely we could reopen for long from the amount we have earned there. 
 
 This generous grant from the LA2050/Goldhirsh Foundation grant committee will provide the funds necessary to reopen at a new location, and we plan on stretching every penny to reach as many artists and make as much art as possible in Los Angeles in 2016, but in the long run, we hope use the funds you've given us to plant seeds that Angeleno Artists may reap for many years to come. 
 
 Los Angeles is our home, and we would like to invest in our city by buying a small part of it. Due to our closure, we already have to find a new location, and this seems the perfect opportunity to turn a tragedy into a mitzvah. There are many commercial real estate options in LA, with ample private parking, that are within our price range. 
 
 The options outlined in the budget proposal assume we purchase at $325,000 (Option A), or rent at $4,500 monthly (Option B). Option A is our preferred option. Option A assumes that If we can purchase with a 20% down payment of $65,000, expecting to make a monthly mortgage of $1,750, then the grant we will have received in 2016 will lay down the infrastructure we need to stay open for generations. 
 
 Our gallery has been operating since 2011 on the donations of artists and art supporters. All of our annual gallery budget goes toward our venue and its related costs. Events, workshops, college visits, and everything else happens through volunteerism in our community, and donations from events. The small but supplemental income from events and donations will fund the deficit between our Grant and Option A, should Option A come to fruition. We will continue to seek donations, so that we may spend our resources and time expanding our services to artists.","Heart Of Art Gallery 2016 LA2050/GOOD Grant Budget:

We look forward to being able to provide our space and our services to the amazing artists of Heart Of Art Gallery. Scaling up will be easy once we have laid the infrastructure made possible by you, the 2016 grant committee.
 
 Every year we have existed, we have grown in attendance and frequency of our programs by at least 10% (in some years 25%). This past year we hosted an event almost every other weekend with full attendance at our gallery. We expect to continue this trajectory of growth. 
 
 If we can budget for 100 creative events in 2016, we will plan for 150 in 2017. Over the next five years we plan to keep the gallery open 24/7 to always be there when our people need safety or a place to create, much like a student union at a university. We will continue to seek more artists until the day Heart of Art stops beating.
 
 As part of our scaling model we also intend to seek funding from the television, film, streaming and advertising industries in LA.
 
 The challenges to our success will always be the continued marginalization of women and LGBTQIA people in poor neighborhoods, but every year that passes in the US brings a few more freedoms and liberties to our communities that we didn't have before. Heart of Art Gallery can only scale up. We will continue to be activists and march for the causes of women and LGBTQIA people, and our success will be measured in direct relation to how the public treats and views us. It will never will be easy to be a creator in our community, but it will always be worth the effort.
 
 Thank you so much for the opportunity to present ourselves to you, the grant committee. We are forever grateful to you for reading this and considering our submission.

Three local organizations – Habitat for Humanity Greater Los Angeles, Grid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles and Climate Resolve – have joined forces to help low-income Angelenos become climate ready by placing solar panels on newly laid cool roofs. With your help, this innovative LA program can become a model for the nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Create,"Climate Ready Roofs is developing a replicable model that demonstrates how our city can become more resilient – even thrive – despite a warmer future. With LA 2050’s help, we will re-roof, eight unique single-family homes in the Los Angeles area with cool roofing shingles, and then install solar electric systems on those roofs. 
 
 The three groups that comprise Climate Ready Roofs serve unique roles in this project which delivers on the promise of clean renewable power and climate resilience to disadvantaged communities.
 
 Climate Resolve will use its relationships with manufacturers to procure roofing materials and further work with local and state agencies to win new cool roof policies throughout the county and state.
 
 GRID Alternatives is the state administrator of the California Public Utilities Commission’s Single-Family Affordable Solar Housing Program, the nation’s first low-income solar program. These funds, along with other donations allow their staff to find clients who qualify for a solar electric system at little to no cost. Although GRID assists hundreds of families annually, approximately 50% cannot receive a solar electric system because of the condition of their roof.
 
 Habitat for Humanity has 25 years of experience working in partnership with low-income homeowners living in greater Los Angeles. More specifically, in the eight years it has offered a Home Repair program, Habitat LA has provided more than 230 low income homeowners with health and safety related repairs, with roof replacements being one of the most frequently provided services. 
 
 Cool roofs are made with materials that naturally reflect sunlight; sending solar waves harmlessly back into the atmosphere. While most standard roofs absorb the sun’s radiant energy into the building—transferring it as heat—cool roofs reflect much of the sunlight to keep buildings cooler, increasing comfort for occupants and reducing the risk of heat-related illness. Because cool roofs are an energy saving technology, there will not need to be as many solar panels installed, since less energy will be required to power the home. This provides an opportunity for a greater number of homeowners to receive solar arrays.
 
 Climate Ready Roofs delivers on the need for environmental equity. It doesn’t just create the roadmap; it helps build the road to a cleaner more equitable future.","Our primary barrier is making cool roofs just as cool and attractive as solar power. Everyone knows solar, but few people know about cool roofs. 
 
 What the public doesn’t know, and needs to learn, is that cool roofs have an esteemed history. Historically, the White Towns of Andalusia in Spain paint their homes bright white to shed the sun’s radiation. Today, in the United States, cool roofs are being made by leading manufacturers, there’s a cool roof industry association and even a cool roof rating council that independently evaluates the effectiveness of roofing material. (Over one thousand products qualify.)
 
 It’s important to note that climate change, as its own phenomenon, will also increasingly drive the public to adopt cool roofs. Given the past year of extreme heat in Los Angeles, and the upward trend predicted by climate scientists – a 3-5°F increase by 2050 – we see the public seeking out cooling technologies in the future.
 
 This is where Climate Ready Roofs steps in.","We will use a variety of measures to evaluate the success of the Climate Ready Roofs projects. To track any changes in energy usage, we will collect and analyze 6 months of pre and post electric usage on each of the 6 families we serve. Second, each of the eight families will be required to complete a post-installation survey asking about the quality of work, level of satisfaction with the application and assessment process, any changes in behavior that would affect their energy usage post-install, the professionalism of the staff, and whether their experience met, exceeded or did not meet their expectations. Third, we will evaluate the success of our education and advocacy efforts by the progress we make towards inspiring the County of Los Angeles to adopt a cool roof ordinance. We believe these are not only achievable goals but the stepping stones to a comprehensive revitalization of underserved communities in Los Angeles and potentially throughout the state and the nation.","The short answer is no. Climate Ready Roofs is a first of its kind program. Bridging climate mitigation and resilience has rarely been attempted, let alone in low-income neighborhoods most in need. It is projected that, by mid-century, Los Angeles will be 3-5° F warmer, and the number of extreme heat days will double. Climate Resolve is the only organization in Los Angeles working to alter the infrastructure of the region to cool down neighborhoods in the face of a warming climate. Couple that with Grid Alternatives’ experience bringing together community partners, volunteers and job trainees on over 950 roofs over eight years to implement solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families at no cost and Habitat LA’s unique network of community partners, donors and volunteers built over the last 25 years to help low-income homeowners restore and maintain their homes through its Home Repair Program, and there is simply no other project like Climate Ready Roofs.","What makes this project so unique isn’t just the energy savings for low-income homeowners or the cooling and improved air quality of the surrounding neighborhoods, but the first-of-its-kind partnership that has developed between three organizations, each with a proven track record of success in creating a more livable, healthier and more equitable city. Climate Resolve has partnered with Grid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles and Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles. 
 
 Grid Alternatives Greater Los Angeles: GLA is a non-profit solar company that provides solar electric systems to low-income families at no cost. The solar arrays are installed using community volunteers and individuals seeking job training for the solar industry. GLA’s vision is a successful transition to clean, renewable energy that includes all people. Solar represents a solution to climate change that can be adopted now to reduce carbon emissions.
 
 Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles: Habitat LA has been providing housing solutions to low income families in greater Los Angeles since 1990. The largest affiliate west of the Mississippi, Habitat LA has built, renovated and repaired over 600 homes in the greater Los Angeles area and has helped build over 400 homes internationally. A commitment to the environment and sustainable building practices has been a core component of Habitat’s work for over a decade. Since 2008, Habitat LA has built more than 50 homes that have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, with 41 of those homes receiving Silver certification or higher","Climate Resolve, GLA and Habitat LA have already come together to place a Climate Ready Roof pilot project for a low-income homeowner in South Los Angeles. Because there is already a model of how this project will work we have experience budgeting for a greater number of homes. Based on this initial project and our history of roof replacement and solar installations, we are confident that we can complete a minimum of eight projects with the $100,000 grant.","EXPENSES

 Climate Ready Roofs is an effective, even obvious, way for the State of California to meet its ambitious goal of cutting electricity use in half in existing buildings by the year 2030. As such, we anticipate California looking to proven models on how buildings can dramatically reduce energy and provide other benefits, such as aiding resilience to warmer temperatures.
 
 LA 2050’s support of Climate Ready Roofs would develop the model. The scale-up could be funded by either the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or via utility rates.
 
 The Climate Ready Roofs model is exciting because it provides so many benefits at a low cost. If scaled-up, the cost of labor will remain low. There are 49 Habitat for Humanity affiliates in California and more than 1,400 throughout the United States. In addition, there are 7 GRID Alternatives affiliates in California and 10 throughout the country. Moreover, the cost of photovoltaic modules is at an all-time low and is expected to come down further. Funding from the PUC will continue to help pay for low income families to receive solar power through at least 2021. Last, the cost of cool roofs will remain low, thanks to LA City’s aforementioned incentive program, which we hope to expand to the county level. Because Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) need to reach 10% reduction in projected load targets via energy efficiency by 2020, utilities have been given permission to pass these costs on to ratepayers – therefore, we can anticipate more support from IOUs. Indeed, if new countywide mandates on cool roofs take hold, similar to what’s in place in the city of LA, the sheer volume of new “cool” roofing materials would help drive down the price."

We will improve grades, increase high school graduation rates and the pursuit of post-secondary education and ensure youth are college and career ready after high school. The Initiative will expand and enhance our College Access Programs in three schools in Carson and four schools in South Los Angeles.
 
 We will provide age and grade appropriate college pathway services at 4 middle schools through our AIM (ACHIEVEMENT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL) FOR COLLEGE component. AIM provides activities to help middle school students begin developing their college and career path. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on academic course work, study habits, preparing for high school and an introduction to college. WORKSHOPS introduce youth to college, the college pathway and what they need to begin doing now to achieve their academic goals. Youth build life skills that will help them succeed academically (study skills, time management, note taking etc.) and in their careers (mock interviews, professional etiquette and networking). AIM transition activities at our elementary school sites prepare incoming 6th grade students and parents for middle school.
 
 Through COLLEGE BOUND, we provide academic support, academic case management and college pathway services to high school youth. ACADEMIC SUPPORT includes tutoring, homework help and writing workshops. Students receive a vast array of COLLEGE PATHWAY PROGRAMMING from SAT, ACT, and CAHSEE prep, to assistance in preparing college, scholarship, and financial aid applications. ACADEMIC CASE MANAGEMENT focuses on preparing for high school graduation, post-secondary options and preparing for success after high school. COLLEGE EXPOSURE activities include college visits, conferences and guest speakers; inspiring youth to pursue post-secondary education. WORKSHOPS cover a vast range of topics from choosing the write college to financial aid. Targeted workshops for 12th grade youth cover topics that help to develop life skills, prepare for success in the workforce and build skills to make appropriate educational and career choices. 
 
 The Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson’s College Access Initiative will provide at-risk, underserved youth with the tools, support and resources to develop the skills and confidence they need to reach their goals and achieve their full potential.","Limited resources are the largest obstacle. The resources available for the College Access Initiative will determine the number of youth that can participate. In order to address this, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson will work with schools and parents to identify and recruit youth who will benefit most from the program to ensure that we are making the greatest impact with the resources we have. Most importantly, we will continue to develop partnerships to increase the resources available to enable the College Access Initiative to reach as many youth as possible.","We are committed to continuous quality improvement and regularly measure the effectiveness of our programs and their impact on youth. Director of Operations, Veronica Jimenez, is a leader in evaluation within the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and was named 2015 National Professional of the Year. Our evaluation process collects data on: 1) Number of youth served; 2) Participation rates; 3) Grades; 4) Grade progression; 5) High school graduation rates and 6) Improvement in competencies and skills. Registration forms document enrollment numbers. Sign-in sheets and rosters record participation. Case management files track academic progress. Our data sharing partnership with LAUSD enables us to receive transcripts and report cards. Parents/guardians sign consent forms allowing schools to release their child’s information to us to track academic outcomes. Pre-/Post-tests measure changes in skills and knowledge.","Other Boys & Girls Clubs and YMCA’s throughout Los Angeles County are just some of the youth serving organizations that provide youth development and educational support to students. However, there are few direct service programs for youth in Carson and South Los Angeles. Many provide limited daily youth programming, serve a different target population or serve a different geographic area from our sites. 
 
 Our people, places and programs are what make the Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson unique.
 
 OUR PEOPLE: Our staff is made up of passionate, committed and qualified professionals who invest knowledge and time to help youth become confident individuals. The dedication and drive of our staff is what sets us apart. The people who come to work at our Clubs are drawn to the same values that define us: high expectations, impact, commitment and integrity. Our staff work to create an environment that nurtures potential, embraces opportunity and encourages growth for all. The interaction between staff and the youth we serve is based on respect, trust and commitment. All of our full-time staff possess college degrees and 63% have masters degrees. 
 
 OUR PLACES: We offer a safe and positive place where youth are given a sense of hope and opportunity for a brighter future. Our Club environments are youth-focused and fun. Youth truly enjoy coming, because the environment is welcoming and engaging. Our Clubs are designed to cultivate youths’ ability to dream, discover and develop their full potential.
 
 OUR PROGRAMS: Our programs develop kids’ minds, build character and nurture healthy lifestyles so they may thrive as adults. We focus on 3 key priority program outcomes: increased Academic Success, Healthy Lifestyles and improved Character & Citizenship. The integration of academic support with our two other core program areas enables us to address all aspects of their lives. By improving their health, well being, confidence and character we help youth reach not only their academic goals, but their personal and career goals as well. Our vision is that 100% of youth who participate in BGCC programs at least three times a week will graduate on time, live healthy, and give back to their community.","We believe that an important part of the success of our programs lie in our collaborative partnerships with organizations and experts within education, health and leadership sectors providing our youth and staff with the best learning experiences. Key partnerships include LAUSD, local schools, corporations, and community based organizations. LAUSD and schools provide referrals, data sharing and activities that align with the school day goals and curriculum. United Way supports our programs at Stephen White and Carnegie Middle Schools. Corporate partners (Toyota Financial Services, Tesoro, Northrop Grumman, Alcoa, Kaiser Permanente, Phillips66, Ross Stores, and Waste Management) provide career mentors and job shadowing. Some have employees serving on the Board of Directors and as program volunteers. The Rotary Club, Kiwanis and Women’s Club provide volunteers. The City of Carson is a partner of various community events and activities. The Sheriff Department Gang Task Force provides and receives referrals for services. Carson Coordinating Council, LA Parks & Recreation and United Way all help to provide free day/resident camp programs to needy youth. Toastmasters provides activities to teens to develop and strengthen their public speaking skills. Local colleges and universities (CSU Dominguez Hills and Harbor College) provide volunteer support and college exposure activities. UCLA RAND Community Advisory Board works to meet the health needs of adolescents and their parents. We developed a partnership with the Carson Wellness Center in Carson High School to provide our teens with access to programs and support in areas such as anger management, teen depression and loss/grief. As a member of Carson High School’s Crisis Team, we have developed connections with other team members that can provide psychological support to our teens that are in need of mental health services and support. We partner with Brotherhood Crusade to provide students in South Los Angeles with sports programs. 
 
 The $100,000 grant award will support Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson staff that implement the programs and work with our partners to bring in additional resources and coordinate activities.","The College Access Initiative Budget is $568,213. Our Beyond the Bell contract with LAUSD underwrites a portion of personnel expenses and program supplies at school sites. A portion of a 3-year grant from the Tesoro Foundation supports the STEM Coordinator and Tech Program Coordinator. We are confident we will cover the additional costs through grants and general operating funds raised through our resource development plan. Our Board and Executive Team participated in the Executive Service Corps’ Developing Development Program that has resulted in a new strategic plan, case for support, and resource development plan. Diversification of funding streams continues to be at the core of our resource development strategy. We implement aggressive fundraising, proposal development, annual special events and individual donor campaigns. 
 
 The Executive Leadership and Board of Directors work together to continue to identify and approach potential funders. The BGCC continues to build upon its existing partnerships with foundations, corporations and businesses and develop new ones to sustain its various programs and services. We have created a successful partnership with Toyota Financial Services that serves as a model to engage volunteers, recognize corporate partners and increase resources and opportunities for youth. Staff and Board work to steward donors and partners to ensure they are recognized, supported, and engaged in the organization. This past year, the BGCC upgraded its donor database. Donor data is now easily accessible, providing our Board of Directors and Resource Development staff with information that will help them to steward our supporters to higher levels of giving and engagement. The addition of a Development Coordinator in 2014 is increasing our marketing and communications. We have developed new marketing material, revamped our website to be more dynamic and engaging and increased our use of social media.
 
 Our Resource Development team plays a leadership role in the newly created Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s Pacific Region Resource Development Exchange. The Exchange enables Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the Pacific Region to share best practices and develop partnerships. Our involvement in the Exchange is placing the BGCC as a leader in resource development nationwide.","PERSONNEL EXPENSES

5102309,College Bridge Program for Graduating High School Seniors,2015205,,,The Ripple Effect will offer a summer bridge program for graduating high school seniors to prepare them for college. The program will include academic and college readiness preparation. Students who successfully complete the program will receive a stipend.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Southeast L.A. County, including Whittier, Santa Fe Springs, Pico Rivera",Learn,"Graduating high school seniors experience what researchers are calling ""The Summer Melt"". Summer Melt is that period between graduating high school and starting college, where students who are college eligible or who have already been accepted to college, will not enroll in classes for the fall semester. Recent studies by Harvard University's Center for Education Policy Research found that an estimated 20 percent of graduating seniors from urban school districts in places such as greater Boston, suburban Atlanta, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, abandon their plans to attend college over the summer. The Ripple Effect will create a 3-week summer bridge program for graduating high school seniors to address this educational concern. Focusing on first generation college students, the bridge program will focus on developing basic math and English skills, and college readiness skills (time management, study techniques, financial aid, creating schedule of classes, etc.). These sessions will be taught by an English and a math teacher, and by a college counselor. Students will also participate in weekly field trips to different cultural and/or educational events and/or locations. These field trips will be chaperoned by volunteers and the college counselor. We will offer 2 bridge sessions, with 30 students in each session. Students that successfully complete the program will receive a $300 stipend. We will also provide a monthly Metro pass for those students in need of reliable transportation. Beyond the bridge program, the coordinator will follow up with students during their first year of college. They will be responsible for assisting students as they navigate their various college systems. Our goal is to assist these 1st time college students successfully make the transition into college. And by providing follow up services throughout the 1st year, we believe that students will be more likely to continue onto their 2nd year of college.","Since the target population is first generation college students, we understand that the process of going to college and being prepared for college can be overwhelming for students. At times, they will want to give up and not continue on with the bridge program. To overcome this barrier, every student that completes the 3 week program will receive a $300 stipend. The idea is to reward those students who remain dedicated, and persevere in completing the program.","We have two objectives we want to measure. (1) Can The Ripple Effect through the summer bridge program assist 60 young people transition into their first semester of college. (2) If we provide follow up services through the first year, how many students can we assist to be academically successful and persist into their 2nd year of college. After the summer bridge program is over, we will assess how many students enroll in and attend their fall classes. If students did not enroll in classes, or enrolled in classes, but did not attend their fall classes, we will follow up with students to better understand why they did not enroll or attend classes. Once students complete their spring semester, we will assess again if students plan to enroll for their 2nd year of college. We will communicate with students either via e-mail and/or phone call. By gathering this data, the organization can assess the areas of weakness and strength in our program, and where we can make improvements.","Several colleges do provide some level of summer bridge programs for their incoming freshman. However, those summer bridge programs are specifically for their students entering those colleges. And sometimes, those bridge programs have various eligibility requirements for students to even be accepted into the program. These requirements can sometimes eliminate students who would benefit greatly from a summer bridge program. What The Ripple Effect plans to do is provide summer bridge programs for graduating high school seniors, regardless of where they plan to attend college. Our program would be open to any graduating high school senior who is a first generation students, regardless of gender, race, academic ability and/or socioeconomic status. We also believe by incorporating some additional support services for students, like the stipend, bus passes for those needing reliable transportation and follow up services, we are providing a value added component to our programs.","The Ripple Effect will be working with three partners, the Skills Foundation in Whittier, E.M.E.R.G.E in Los Angeles, and Fit to Play in Anaheim. These 3 organizations will be assisting with recruiting students, providing instructors for the bridge program, providing volunteers and providing locations for the bridge program to be held. Each organization will receive $1,000 from the grant.","We believe to provide two sessions of a summer bridge program servicing 60 students, it will cost approximately $62,000.","This would be expenses for 2 sessions of the bridge program, servicing a total of 60 students.

By continuing to develop relationships with organizations, like E.M.E.R.G.E., the Skills Foundation and Fit to Play, The Ripple Effect is positioning itself to be a viable candidate for other grants. Our goal is to grow the number of sessions we can offer to students from 2 sessions to 4 sessions.

UFC’s College Readiness (CRP) and College Sponsorship (CSP) programs work harmoniously to create this pipeline for success. 
 
 The goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school ready to succeed at a 4-year college or university. The CRP supports students from 7th through 12th grades. College Counselors meet one-on-one with each student in their homes and maintain frequent contact with students via telephone and email. The content of these meetings is driven by both the student’s needs and the counselor’s recommendations. Counselors serve as the main conduit for delivering a range of program content to CRP students. Acknowledging the crucial role caregivers have in helping maintain stability for students, UFC offers training in communication, conflict resolution, and other subjects designed to help them cope during a challenging developmental stage in the lives of all youth. 
 
 UFC also uses monthly Saturday workshops and college tours, facilitated by CRP College Counselors, to deliver program content, and encourage social interaction and the development of a college-bound culture among participants. Through these various activities, participation in the program helps students to earn their high-school diploma, graduate four-year-college eligible, apply to and attend college. We will serve 500 youth in the CRP in the coming year. 
 
 The College Sponsorship Program is a commitment of personal and financial support for up to 5 years to foster youth attending 4-year institutions. In addition to a $15,000/ five-year scholarship, each youth is paired one-on-one with a College Counselor. Counselors serve as the key source of support, guidance and as a resource throughout a student’s college experience. The program also includes paid internships, enrichment activities and post-graduation planning. By keeping youth involved, engaged, and interested in their education through close, mentoring relationships with UFC counselors, the CSP is increasing college graduation rates for foster youth.
 
 In ever increasing numbers, youth are graduating from high school through the CRP and attending universities through the CSP. In 2015, 25 seniors participating in the CRP joined the latest cohort in the CSP. In total, more than 200 students will participate in the CSP.","The most significant challenge that we face long-term is one that, in fact, attests to the growth and success of our program. Each year, more and more youth are completing our College Readiness Program, graduating high school, applying and gaining admission to four year colleges and universities. This success presents us with a challenge to expand our Sponsorship program for college youth even were we to no longer accept applicants to this program who had not participated in our middle and high school programs, which we are not, frankly, convinced that we should do. Our strategy for overcoming this challenge is to increase resources for the sponsorship program, which is addressed further in our response to the scaling question below.","Thanks to the generous support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, UFC is in the first phase of work that will result in an impact evaluation of our programs by an independent party. The overarching aim of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of UFC’s programs in improving outcomes for both current and former foster youth. In addition, we plan to study the impact of UFC’s relationship-based approach to serving youth. 
 
 UFC has been utilizing Social Solutions’ Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) database since 2009. As of January 2015, we have implemented redesigned “Touchpoints” – the interfaces that program staff uses to input data – for all UFC programs, and we are currently refining the process of data collection and reporting. UFC Counselors are responsible for entering data on all their interactions with the youth they serve. Review of the data is the role of our Outcomes & Evaluation Director, who we hired in June to oversee the entire process.","While there are certainly other organizations working to support educational achievement by foster youth (whether as a distinct population or as part of a broader effort of support for at-risk youth) UFC’s initiatives are unique in our exclusive focus on LA County Foster Youth, and most importantly, in our approach. All of UFC’s work is based on four basic principles: (1) developing trusting relationships with youth, (2) high expectations for youth achievement, (3) removing barriers to progress, and (4) consistent long-term commitment and support. 
 
 UFC’s education programs are unique in the application of these principles to the educational challenges facing foster youth through the creation of an educational support continuum that can last as long as 11 years. We encourage youth to join our Readiness program in the 7th grade to gain the full benefit of our program, though some to enter as late as the 9th grade. Our experience shows that for youth who persist in the program for four years or more:
 
 • 100% graduate high school
 • 60% graduate four-year-college-eligible; and
 • 50% matriculate directly to four-year institutions
 
 Among the 40 students admitted to our College Sponsorship Program in 2015, were all 25 who completed the CRP and moved on to a four-year institution of higher education. (the remainder are LA County Foster Youth who applied directly to the CSP after completing high school without participating in the CRP). As the number of youth completing the CRP continues to grow (annual cohorts have grown each year since the program’s inception), increasingly those participating in the CSP will be completing an 11-year relationship with UFC. While we are proud of the achievement of our CSP scholars (<60% earning a bachelors degree within five years) we are especially encouraged by the success of those participating in this 11-year continuum. For the class of 2011, 71% are on track to graduate within five years, and for the classes of 2012 and 2013, 100% are on track to do so.","One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with other organizations. Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual foster youth. Through our decades of experience serving youth and working with other service providers, both public and private, UFC is able to connect youth with trusted, high quality services, including:
 
 • UCLA Connecting Communities – supports participation of CRP youth in CODE to College (3 day/2 night UCLA program for rising 9th graders and alumni)
 • Fostering Horizons – helps our students access funding for private schools and assists with school-related funding needs for our students attending charter and private schools.
 • CASA – provides office space for the CRP Outreach and Recruitment Coordinator for recruitment efforts within Edelman Courthouse
 • Public Counsel – provides staff training and legal guidance for UFC
 • Green Dot (Locke Family of Schools) – recruitment, classroom space for workshops, office space for counselors during school day, access to students during school day
 • Paramount Unified School District (PUSD) – supports recruitment, classroom space for workshops, access to students during school day, provides a laptop to UFC College Counselor working with PUSD students
 • University of Southern California (USC) – classroom and computer lab space for workshops, venue for annual college fair.
 
 Each of our partnership agreements call for self-funding by each participating organization. Because of the significant investment (>$3 million annually) that UFC makes in the proposed programs, all funding received will support UFC.","The total budget for UFC’s education programs described in the present proposal is $3,218,062 for the 2015-16 fiscal year (ending June 30). To date, we have approximately $1.25 million in funding committed, with more than $2 million in additional requests pending or in preparation. Other funding required for this core initiative of the organization will be provided through unrestricted resources.","Funding received will be allocated among some of the most critical elements of the budget, including:
 
 Counselor salaries and benefits: $50,000
 Participant transportation for workshops and other events: $20,000
 Tutoring: $20,000
 
 The final $10,000 will be allocated to the essential indirect expenses without which no program would be possible.","UFC has ambitious long-term growth plans for its education programs, and there is certainly no lack of foster youth who would benefit from program expansion. We have held preliminary talks with a number of agencies (DCFS, school districts) exploring opportunities for program expansion, which could help us to scale the programs further should funding become available. To this end, we have been in discussion with a number of funders about supporting program growth, and launched a new initiatives campaign to secure additional individual and corporate support for these programs. Should funding become available through these efforts, we are poised to scale up to achieve growth (as we have done with our supportive housing program in 2015, which has achieved <40% growth in the current year).
 
 Meanwhile, we expect that the external evaluation of our program that is currently underway will help us to validate our relationship-based service model, and identify opportunities to improve our program delivery, so that not only can we scale the program locally, but encourage its replication in communities nationwide."

By utilizing the universal power of play, we will engage Los Angeles sports fans in a truly unique way, giving them an experience they will never have had elsewhere.
 
 We will then utilize the engagement to increase attendance rates at Major League Sports events by having our games only at sports events and by working with Los Angeles teams specifically to brand them.","One of the major barriers we anticipate is a technological one. What we do relies heavily on the internet and wifi capabilities of whatever venue we're at. So what happens when its not great, but 10000 people want to play a game together?
 
 There are several ways for us to overcome that obstacle. On one hand, we can (and are) literally count bytes in the information we send across the internet, limiting it only to what's necessary. On the other hand, we can work with venues directly and either work with them to improve their infrastructure, or implement our own local networks that people can connect up to and play.","We will evaluate our work through numbers like the number of venues we're in, and how many people are playing in those venues. The most important metric would be the growth rate of total participation; essentially how many more people have played a game this week versus last week. If that number continues to increase at a steady rate, we'll know we are on the right track.","There are a couple other organizations working in the same general area as us: Timeplay and Audience Entertainment. However, they are not entering or prepared to enter the major league sports space, and take on crowds of 1000 - 10000+ like we are. In addition, unlike them, we realize that the individual experience is key to making this work and thus strive to make that the best possible experience we can.

However, pretty much all of them are limited in their interactivity or participation levels and fall flat.",n/a,"To roll it out quickly yet polished, an initial limited implementation of our technology and content in several major sports venues is predicted to cost about $91,700.

Our programs bring healthy food to children in need, while also teaching them how to prepare nutritious, affordable meals and snacks on their own. During the 2015-2016 school year, we will partner with 15 Los Angeles schools to implement our proven programming, thereby reaching a total of 3,649 individuals.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,0CreatePlay0,"Common Threads will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by providing underserved kids (grades 3-8), their families, and their teaches with hands-on, in- and out-of-school cooking and nutrition education that brings healthy food to children in need, while also improving nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. As the Institute of Medicine recommends fighting childhood obesity in part by making schools ""the heart of health,"" and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends up to 50 hours per year per child of nutrition education, we work with schools to incorporate as many of our programs as possible into the school's schedule and according to their needs, thereby increasing individual students' exposure to nutrition education while fostering a community-wide culture of health. 
 
 During the 2015-16 school year, we will partner with 15 LA schools to expand our programming, reaching 1,000 more kids, parents/guardians, and teachers than we did during the previous year. Specifically, we will engage up to 3,649 individuals in up to 140 distinct program sessions (for a total of over 33,200 program hours) and will provide these individuals with up to 27,442 healthy meals and snacks they have prepared themselves. Because food insecurity and other factors related to poverty can contribute to obesity, we specifically target schools where at least 80% of students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch. 
 
 In our programs, participants cook and prepare healthy, culturally-diverse meals and snacks from scratch with affordable ingredients and an emphasis on whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and less fat and sodium – and thereby not only receive nutritious food during our programs, but also gain the skills and knowledge needed to cook and eat healthy on their own. Programs include: a Cooking Skills and World Cuisine afterschool program; an in-school, teacher-led Small Bites nutrition education program and Garden Classes; Parent Workshops; family Grocery Store Tours; Family and Teacher Cooking Classes; and Healthy Teacher Trainings. 
 
 Our programmatic approach has resulted in measurable outcomes that create a strong foundation for a future of improved personal health. Indeed, our school year 2013-14 evaluation results showed that, of students with room to improve, 81% improved their nutrition knowledge, 43% increased their preference for healthy food, and 51% of students increased their vegetable consumption.","We are committed to ongoing, rigorous evaluation that utilizes the best methods for understanding our program’s impact. However, due to our programs’ size and geographical range, one major challenge we anticipate to our evaluation is collecting representative data. During the 2015-16 school year, we are addressing this challenge by: 1) sampling a randomly chosen subset of participants; 2) converting our data collection to scannable forms; and 3) decentralizing our data entry function. As a small organization, we are also challenged by time needed to comply with varying regulations governing student privacy in 6 districts and have thus hired a full-time associate to ensure compliance. Lastly, because our data collection is done by our program instructors, we have developed more detailed material to support them in this collection and integrated the survey into the first and last lessons more seamlessly, so that they may be used as an element of the curriculum, rather than a distraction.","We evaluate our programs through annual internal pre- and post-surveys of student and parent participants. In addition to measuring the impact of our programs on participants’ nutrition and cooking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, these surveys also capture data on dose delivered and received, fidelity, and context. Due to the large numbers of students participating in our programming across the country, we randomly chose schools to participate in our school year 2015-16 survey to achieve a national sample of 750 Small Bite student participants and 750 chef-led program participants. Previous experience shows that this number is adequately powered to detect the effect of our programming. At the end of each school year, we analyze the survey data, matching pre- and post-surveys to determine net change.
 
 Teachers also complete surveys after completing our Healthy Teacher Training and are able to provide feedback on and suggestions for the training.","While there are other organizations in LA that offer health and/or nutrition programs for kids and/or families, many of them complement Common Threads’ programs; target different areas in LA; or have a different programmatic approach and/or scope. We maintain partnerships with some of these health and wellness-focused organizations, including, for instance Revolution Foods, as well as with other youth-serving organizations, including LA’s BEST, Beyond the Bell, Boys and Girls Club, and Youth Policy Institute.
 
 Common Threads’ approach is unique in that we combine scalable, hands-on intensive cooking programs and nutrition education curricula with parent engagement and teacher trainings to maximize impact and create a culture of wellness in our partner schools. Additionally, by working with schools to implement as many of our complementary programs as possible and aligning our programs to local wellness policies, we further help foster a school-wide culture of health. Moreover, our programmatic approach goes beyond simply promoting nutrition and good health by utilizing research-based curriculum – created and refined in-house by our curriculum staff with input from educators, chefs, and nutritionists – to educate participants on how to adopt, practice, and maintain healthy behaviors. Indeed, our curriculum is rooted in both internal and external evaluations and aligned to the nutrition theory of Dr. Isobel Contento, Professor of Nutrition and Education at Columbia University, and we incorporate experiential learning strategies that research has shown lead to the greatest improvements in health behaviors, including improved diet quality. Additionally, our program instructors are trained chefs and teachers who implement the entire program, thereby also serving as mentors to the kids in our programs.
 
 Lastly, our programs are unique in that they are also designed to promote success in the classroom by utilizing curriculum aligned to Common Core Standards for math and English and Next Generation Science Standards and by helping kids establish healthy habits that research – such as a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control - has linked to academic achievement. For example, in our Small Bites nutrition education program, trained teachers engage students in connecting math, language arts, and science concepts to hands-on nutrition lessons.","During the 2015-2016 school year, Common Threads will work closely with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and its umbrella of schools, as well as area charter school networks, to deliver our full program menu of healthy cooking and nutrition education to children, parents/guardians, and teachers. We will provide our programming to our partner schools at no cost to them or to participants. The direct program cost per school is $8,000, which is all underwritten by Common Thread’s own fundraising. Thus, while the $100,000 award will directly go to Common Threads, we will utilize these funds to provide our programming to our partner schools for free.
 
 Our Los Angeles Program Manager will work directly with school administration to incorporate as many components of our programming as possible in both in- and out-of-school settings, and schools will provide kitchen space for our afterschool programs at no cost. Additionally, thanks to approval from LAUSD this past April, we are able to award salary point (Professional Development) credit to teachers who participate in Common Threads’ Healthy Teacher Training program; this school year, we except up to 320 teachers to complete the Training and thus receive salary point credit.
 
 Our confirmed 2015-2016 school year partners are as follows: Aspire Titan Academy, Glenfeliz Boulevard Elementary School, Hollenbeck Middle School, John Adams Middle School, KIPP Comienza Community Prep, KIPP Sol Academy, Pacoima Charter School, Para Los Niños, and Sunrise Elementary.","Our total projected 2015-2016 school year budget for our programming in Los Angeles is $781,752.
 We will cover the additional costs through support from other foundations and corporations, including committed funding from Ralph’s/Food 4 Less Foundation, Herbalife, the Fresh Produce and Floral Council, the Julia Child Foundation, and Whole Kids Foundation; special event revenue; and individual contributions. 
 
 Moreover, Common Threads ensures the viability and longevity of its mission and programs by recruiting and seating board members that provide leadership and participate in efforts that financially support the organization. Boards include a National Board of Directors and local Advisory Boards and
 Associate Boards in our markets, including an Associate Board in Los Angeles. All board members assist in the cultivation of productive partner relationships; however, it is our Associate Board whose primary role is to fundraise, particularly through events. Additionally, we cultivate productive partner relationships with individuals, foundations, corporations, culinary communities and, especially, schools, parents and children; and hire staff (and volunteers) with skills and expertise in nutrition, cooking, education, fundraising and nonprofit management.","Salaries and Wages: $25,000; this includes the salaries of our National Program Manager as well as our LA Program Manager, who oversee all programming in LA, including supporting program implementation at each school; managing both Chefs and volunteers; and overseeing school, district, and local organization partnerships.
 
 Chefs/Program Supplies: $70,000; includes chef instructor training and pay*; the training of classroom teachers*; and healthy groceries, curriculum, cookbooks, and cooking equipment for our in- and after-school nutrition education and cooking programs. 
 
 *Our after-school programs are led by trained Chef Instructors and volunteers, while our in-school programs are led by trained teachers from our partner schools. 
 
 Evaluation: $5,000; this includes the costs of data collection and analysis for our 2015-2016 school year evaluation, as described above.","In Los Angeles, we will continue to scale our programming and grow our reach by: 1) increasing uptake of our Small Bites nutrition education program among our partner schools; 2) continuing to prove out our new model of implementing Small Bites in partnership with out-of-school time program providers and district-led, in- and after-school initiatives; and 3) deepening our engagement within each partner school. Small Bites is an effective but lower-cost program, with the added benefits of being aligned to Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards and being flexible enough to leverage as part of partnerships with other organizations; thus, by expanding Small Bites, we will reach more kids and families in an efficient, sustainable, and impactful way.
 
 Additionally, this past year, we developed a game-based nutrition education app, CommonBytes, which we believe has the potential to supplement our current programs, increasing their impact in the short term, and to bring relevant nutrition learning to additional kids in the long term. The CommonBytes app includes interactive games designed for students grades 3-8 to use with classroom teachers in school – including as a supplement to our Small Bites program - or at home. Participants follow recipes from the garden to the grocery store to the kitchen, and, finally, to a table. The CommonBytes platform will consist of 10-15 games – with easy, medium, and hard levels - that incorporate gardening, healthy shopping, healthy cooking techniques, and table etiquette as well as over 25 recipes, organized by Snacks, Meals, Beverages, and Treats. Incentive points and badges that further the nutritional experience (e.g., personal secrets and recipes from celebrity chefs) will be awarded as various milestones and goals are reached. Parents and teachers will also be able to access the app to track the progress of their child or student in completing the games; look up new recipes; or find cooking and nutrition resources.
 
 This fall, we are piloting CommonBytes in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, with a national pilot –including in Los Angeles – planned for 2016. Overall, during the 2015-16 school year, we expect up to 5,000 kids to receive cooking and nutrition education through CommonBytes."

We are currently composting over 2,000lbs of food weekly across 5 hubs countywide. Over the next 5 years we plan to expand our work by building 20 more hubs and establishing composting programs that will keep unnecessary food scraps out of landfills, providing communities with the tools and education needed to compost locally.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,ALL,"Our goal is to reconnect the city of L.A. with the soil that feeds us. We want people to understand that completing the entire loop (farm to table, table to compost, compost to farm) is a significant goal. In order to reach this goal L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are teaming up to expand an entirely local compost model. 
 
 Our hub model currently diverts waste from landfills and provides rich compost to neighborhoods and school gardens in Monrovia, Elysian Valley Community Garden, and at USC and the Natural History Museum. The creation of 20 new hubs will provide ongoing education to local communities and change the way individuals look at “waste”. Instead of having only one option where residents throws away countless organics in the trash, a large truck hauls them over an hour away, creates compost, and sells it back to the same individuals whose waste created the compost, we want to help localize it. By localizing the process and keeping it within the community, we continue to divert thousands of pounds of organics from reaching the landfill, and we create a valuable product through compost. This is then distributed to local growers in the area, as well as edible school and community gardens, to contribute to the growth of their green spaces.
 
 The composting hubs we build for LA communities create a space where individuals can coexist and create change side by side. They are a tool for educating the public about composting for soil health, a testimony to the practicality of composting, and a distribution center from which we send compost made on-site into the local community. 
 
 Composting is a beautiful, regenerative process that is collaborative, self-giving, and exemplifies the type of city we want to embody. Localized food systems will be the way of the future… LA can lead the way.
 
 Why Compost?
 
 Diversion: Collectively, 20 new hubs will have the capacity to divert 1,500 lbs. of organics per day, 10,500 lbs. per week, and over 540,000 lbs. per year.
 Drought: Compost acts as a natural sponge, storing water and holding moisture in the soil for plants to use when needed. When it rains, water that falls on land covered in compost can actually soak into the soil, rather than washing off into the storm drains. 
 Climate change: Healthy soil helps removes excess carbon from the air and stores it in the ground.
 Healthy Food: Viewing food scraps as a resource and keeping it in the community allows for Healthy soil=healthy plants =healthy people.","Lack of education about composting has caused many people to negatively associate it with dirt or garbage-many believe it is an inherently dirty or smelly process. Los Angeles residents have mentioned that they have tried composting, but one bad experience due to mismanagement (which often causes smell, bugs or raccoons) caused them to stop and never give it a second chance. 
 
 In order to overcome the negative stigmas associated with composting, we will implement an education plan for every compost hub we create. These plans will discuss the composting process with residents and equip them with all they need to understand its value and how simple it is to make. By modeling successful composting at local hubs, we will reveal the positive impact that the process has on both food production and quality of life. In communities where this strategy has already been adopted, residents who attend our workshops consistently express to us their new understanding of and appreciation for compost","1) Track weight of organics diverted from landfills: Prior to depositing organics into one of our composting systems, we weigh and record the amount of food or yards scraps. This record gives us a clear picture as to how many organics are being diverted from landfills each week, month, and year.
 
 2) Record attendance at workshops/hubs: By tracking how many people are interacting with their local compost hub, as well as tracking attendance at workshops we will be able to measure the interest from the local community. As interest and educational opportunities increase, more individuals will have the tools needed to compost on their own.
 
 3) Measure how much finished compost is being created: By weighing the finished product we can determine how much finished compost is being used and kept in the same community where it was created. This will allow us to gauge how many gardens and farms we are contributing to throughout the county.","School garden organizations (Enrich LA, Garden School Foundation) and food resource and recovery agencies (Food Forward, L.A. Kitchen) are doing a great job when it comes to growing food at schools and capturing usable food that might otherwise be thrown away. L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are focusing on a different chapter when it comes to the story of food by focusing on soil health by composting materials that can no longer be consumed. Once, composted the material is kept within the same community where it was created and distributed to local growers (school, community gardens, parks).
 
 Apart from school garden groups and food recovery agencies, haulers in L.A. over the next few years will begin to offer organic pick up services. We do not view this as competition, but rather an opportunity to collaborate. Since the roll out of curbside organic pick ups will only cover a portion of L.A. County, there are still plenty of opportunities to create local solutions for those who don’t have any composting options. Larger cities across the U.S. have adopted citywide composting, and residents in these cities are still enthused about participating in a more local solution that keeps the resources within their zip code. 
 
 Each organization plays an important role when it comes to telling the entire story of food and both L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground are excited to lead the charge when it comes to soil health and keeping unnecessary material out of landfills on a local level. By focusing on the heartbeat of the food system (soil) we are working to ensure that there will be good local food for years to come.","L.A. Compost and Kiss the Ground have worked with several partners throughout the county. Through our combined efforts we believe that this work will only improve over time and that each city throughout the county will have access to a local composting solution by 2050. The money given to each partner will support existing hubs and new compost programs.

 We plan on covering additional costs by doing the following:
 
 1) Workshop costs: Each year we hold over 20 workshops for schools, businesses, community gardens, and apartment complexes. We will continue to receive donations from these events to fund the ongoing creation of our hubs throughout the county.
 
 2) Hub Events: Our hubs are the perfect platform to host a fundraising dinner or special engagement. The costs from these events will support our work and future hubs.
 
 3) Selling compost to commercial landscapers: In the likely event that we have extra compost from a hub, we can offer this valuable product to commercial landscapers for their growing needs. 
 
 4) Crowd Funding: In order for residents within communities to feel as if they are a part of a hub, we will create opportunities for them to invest in this local shared space.

We will work on creating a seamless process that allows a new community to start a new hub when ready. From schools and restaurants to community gardens and parks we will look for areas central to the communities where they are located to maximize community usage. This approach has already proven to be effective as two affordable housing buildings in Downey and Mar Vista are excited to move forward with new their compost hub.
 
 We will also approach larger waste and organic haulers in the future to identify ways in which we can collaborate. Unfortunately in Los Angeles there is more food scraps and yard waste than companies and groups of people to handle it all. By partnering with those who’ve been trying to deal with the issue of keeping organics out of land fills, we can help through educating communities and creating local solutions.
 
 Food scraps will continue to exist and because of how much we produce, some of it will often find its way in a landfill. Unless we change the way we look at it (how we now view glass, plastic, and aluminum as a reusable product) it will be hard to create long lasting change. Through educating individuals within their community and providing options for them to be part of this change, we believe our hubs have the potential to change the issue we have with waste both now, and through 2050."
5102123,Comprehensive Nutrition Education Programs,2016094,,,"Groceryships pilot programs achieved profound physical and emotional health results for the low-income families struggling with diabetes and obesity. Now, with a recently opened community center, Groceryships wants to dramatically expand the number of programs we can offer to families. The $100,000 grant would provide six months of weekly nutrition education classes and free access to healthy produce for 300 families living in South LA.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,None,"Obesity is a contributing factor in five of the top seven causes of death (heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes). In South LA, childhood obesity is 30% and life expectancy is 10 years less than other parts of LA. The poverty rate in LA County (15%) is among the highest in the country and the rate of depression exceeds 30% for those in poverty. This combination of health, financial, and psychological pressures makes it extremely difficult to live a healthy life in low-income food deserts.
 
 Groceryships has created a scalable, cost-effective program model that counteracts obesity and diabetes for low-income families in food deserts. Our educational support groups take 10 parents through weekly, two-hour meetings over a 6-month period. 40% of each class is spent on nutrition education and healthy cooking. 60% is spent on emotional and social support. Sitting in a circle, participants share about their lives and challenges with food and health. This group structure creates the emotionally supportive bonds where education and motivation take root.
 
 Groceryships also provides free access to healthy food each week for the duration of the 6-month program through delivery of fresh produce. This provides much needed economic benefit for families facing extreme budget pressures and also helps with developing preferences for new kinds of fresh vegetables and fruits. Class cooking workshops are also integrated with the fresh produce families receive, making is easy for preparing new types of meals at home.
 
 Learning these critical life skills for navigating the challenging health environment found in food deserts has direct impact on preventing or reversing Type 2 diabetes and obesity. We imagine LA in 2050 to be a city where families don't struggle with health and have the knowledge and resources to live happy, healthy, productive lives. With this in mind, Groceryships has had group results such as: 
 
 • All participants reported eating significantly more fruits & vegetables
 • All families reported they had children lose weight
 • All families reported additional family members lost weight
 • Participants reversed diabetes risk factors and lowered cholesterol levels
 
 With these promising results, Groceryships is on a mission to offer this life-changing experience to more families. Groceryships will make LA the healthiest place to live through this comprehensive model that supports families with better health for a lifetime.","One major challenge Groceryships and families have during programs is the external financial pressures and personal stressors participants face in their daily lives. Health and emotional wellbeing are highly impacted by life circumstance, and for the population Groceryships serves, the pressures are substantial. If participants experience extra financial difficulty during the program such as job loss or family crisis, results and health improvement could suffer. This could lead to decreased healthy food budgets and could lessen motivation for making positive lifestyle changes.
 
 To ameliorate the potential impact of external pressures, Groceryships prioritizes group peer support for dealing with personal life difficulties and also refers participants to therapists as needed. For financial constraints for healthy food, Groceryships is constantly developing new partners and resources for providing healthy food for families and helping them shop healthier at a lower cost.","For evaluating program effectiveness, Groceryships makes extensive use of surveys and physical health measurements. Data is reviewed at the conclusion of each program and is used for refining and improving the program model. Surveys and measurements are focused on three primary evaluation factors:
 
 • Fruit & Vegetable Consumption - this determines the level of habit change for eating healthy foods and increased access to healthy foods.
 
 • Body Mass Index - BMI is measured to determine if participants have decreased their weight during programs. The goal is gradual, long-term weight loss to support a healthy life.
 
 • Emotional Wellbeing - the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale questionnaire is used to determine how well emotional wellbeing improves during programs.
 
 This data is collected and evaluated by Groceryships staff, Board, and advisors to determine which aspects of the program are working well and what can be improved as new programs are launched.","In Los Angeles, several other nonprofit organizations and hospitals have nutrition education components as part of their community focus. For example, Esperanza Community Housing has a program to train community health workers to work in low-income areas and Root Down LA has a nutrition & culinary program for high school students.
 
 While there are organizations that have great programs for improving health, Groceryships is unique from other educational initiatives in the following ways:
 
 • Duration - Groceryships programs are 6-months in length. This is longer than many nutrition classes or programs and allows ample time for families to make lasting habit changes, learn new cooking skills, and develop healthy shopping strategies. Long-term health is not a quick fix and gradual, deep changes are necessary over time.
 
 • Depth - Groceryships has a 24-week specialized curriculum with presentations and printouts for each weekly class. This provides comprehensive knowledge of nutrition and the food system, and goes into much greater depth compared to many other nutrition education programs.
 
 • Food Scholarship - the free healthy produce we provide families every week makes it much easier to experiment with healthy food and change meal habits over time. This economic benefit also helps families lower their food budgets after the program concludes because they learn which healthy foods fit with their budget.
 
 • Group Connection - adopting a new healthy lifestyle is dramatically easier with the support of friends and community connections. By creating tight-knit program groups, participants have the emotional support and motivation to improve their lives together as a community. With half of class time dedicated to peer support and sharing, very strong social connections are developed that last well after programs conclude.
 
 All of these elements combine to offer a comprehensive and unique approach to health that enables families to chart a new course for the rest of their lives. We imagine the ripple effects of current Groceryships groups to last to 2050 and beyond, as healthy habits are passed from generation to generation and spread throughout communities where families support each other on this long-term journey.","Groceryships recognizes that partnerships play a critical role for providing an impactful experience for the families we support. Groceryships has worked with a variety of partners to magnify results, decrease program costs, and recruit participating families. These partnerships include organizations such as:
 
 • LA's Promise - assists Groceryships with recruiting parents from schools in South LA and enrolling them into Groceryships programs. Past Groceryships programs have been run at LA Promise schools as well as workshops and program graduations.
 
 • Esperanza Community Housing – with Esperanza’s network of community health workers, Groceryships has trained Spanish-speaking promotoras to lead Groceryships program groups. This partnership enables Groceryships to dramatically increase the amount of offered programs and gives opportunity for the promatoras to directly serve families in their community.
 
 • Food Forward – provides donated farmers market produce as part of the healthy food scholarship Groceryships distributes to families. This gives families access to additional sources of fresh produce and simultaneously lowers Groceryships’s program operational costs for the food scholarship component.
 
 • LA Job Corps – has provided culinary and logistics support for Groceryships programs including food storage and food preparation. Groceryships also ran a program for LA Job Corps students, advised with revamping the cafeteria food options, and held an on-campus event & health documentary series for 300-400 students.
 
 • LIFT – refers families in South LA to join Groceryships programs and Groceryships is also able to refer participants and alumni to LIFT's financial literacy and job assistance programs. This combination of mutually supportive services is an important relationship for helping families increase their physical and financial health simultaneously, as these two areas are tightly connected and vital for every family Groceryships works with.
 
 • Vitamix – currently donates refurbished high-end blenders to Groceryships families. This ties directly to Groceryships cooking classes where vegetable and fruit smoothie recipes are taught as smoothies are a quick and easy way to increasing fresh produce consumption.
 
 These are all partnership collaborations where budget is not necessary for facilitating the partnership. If awarded the $100,000 grant, all funding would be used by Groceryships to grow the number of family nutrition programs.","With this $100,000 grant, Groceryships could offer the program to 300 families in South LA through 30 new programs. The current direct cost per Groceryships group is $3,630 for the complete the 6-month program ($363 per participating family for 10 families per group).
 
 At this current cost, 30 program groups would cost $108,900 ($3,630 x 30) and would be held at the new Groceryhships community center near USC. The remaining balance of $8,900 could be covered through private donations from fundraising events Groceryships organizes several times a year, or from foundation grants that Groceryships applies for. Below is the total cost breakdown:
 
 Per program costs = $3,630
  • Cost per family, 10 families per group = $363
 
 Cost for 30 programs = $108,900
  • Number of families reached = 300
 
 Funding for 30 programs:
  • LA 2050 grant - $100,000
  • Private donations or foundation support - $8,900
 
 Groceryships is constantly working to lower the cost per program so it's possible that all 30 programs could be run for $100,000 with no extra private donation or foundation support needed. The first pilot program cost $2,500 per participating family and the current cost is $363 per family, a decrease of 85%. This has been accomplished through recruiting volunteer vs. paid health coaches and creating partnerships with donated fresh produce suppliers like Food Forward vs. buying produce at cost and providing produce gift certificates.","The following budget is the cost per Groceryships program:

 Total Variable Cost per Program:
 • Gross Expense = $15,603
 • In-Kind = $11,974
 • Net Cash Expense = $3,629","Groceryships has created a scalable model that can expand to reach hundreds and thousands of families over the coming years. This scalability is the result of strong partnerships and a training model that allows high-volume program growth.
 
 One primary partnership component involves the healthy food scholarship, as this is a crucial aspect of the program. Previously this was a limiting factor due to the financial cost involved with providing fresh food each week. Through establishing partnerships with Food Forward and Christian Food Center to secure produce at drastically lower cost, Groceryships has decreased the fresh produce scholarship budget per program from over $2,000 to under $200 per participating family. This allows for a much more scalable model and Groceryships can offer the program experience to nearly ten times as many families for the same financial cost.
 
 The other primary partnership component Groceryships has focused on is training new health coaches. Groceryships recently created a partnership with Esperanza Community Housing to train their community health workers to teach Groceryships programs. Groceryships's program director runs workshops for training Esperanza's community health leaders with the Groceryships curriculum, resulting in a much larger group of potential health coaches for future programs.
 
 In addition to health coaches, each group is supported by a participant who previously graduated from a Groceryships group. These graduates serve as Program Ambassadors, and help ensure that health coaches lead groups in accordance with Groceryships’s principles and procedures. Additionally, the Program Ambassador leads the cooking class each week, giving participants hands-on experience preparing and tasting healthy meals.
 
 By greatly lowering the cost per program and growing the roster of health coaches and Program Ambassadors, Groceryships is now in a prime position to quickly scale. In 2015 Groceryships will run 10 programs for 100 families and has the capacity to run 30 or more programs in 2016 if the necessary funding is secured. Running 30 programs in 2016 would allow Groceryhips to scale even more rapidly with the number of additional trained health coaches and graduates for becoming Program Ambassadors. Having 300 additional alumni families from 30 new programs would also drive increased referrals for more Groceryships programs and intensify the priority for health in the South LA community."

Working in neighborhoods along the river and across the basin, CtD uses advanced hydrologic data as public art, empowering and inspiring citizens to help solve our city’s transit, public space, and water.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"thirsty neighborhoods dotted across the 864-sq-mile LA Basin, on the river and off.",ALL,"CtD design workshops engage citizens with unseen water systems beneath their feet, using full-scale stormwater and groundwater visualizations on city surfaces. Workshops prompt dialog about potential water-smart public investment, and facilitate partnerships among designers and community members. CtD documents emerging visions for a re-shaped public realm; tests and celebrates temporary demonstration projects at full-scale; and prepares and presents synthesis proposals for long-term change.
 
 CtD workshops produce recommendations for long-term change that:
 • improve safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists;
 • anticipate light rail, BRT, and transit-oriented development;
 • capture stormwater as groundwater augmentation;
 • promote open space, natural habitat, and urban cooling zones;
 • honor the specific culture and character of the neighborhood. 
 
 CtD workshops engage communities at multiple scales:
 • Hazel Table, a hands-on teaching tool, delivers three learning objectives: what is an aquifer and how does it work? How does the design of the built environment impact it? What urban design changes are possible to improve local water resources? Design educators, professionals, and students gather at the Hazel Table with families, residents, and business owners to explore the basics of urban water systems.
 • Hazel Dots are pixels of advanced hydrologic data drawn at full scale. Using high-resolution geospatial data drawn from Arid Lands Institute research, workshop leaders and volunteers lay out full-scale maps of subterranean Los Angeles. A large scale “X-Ray” of the neighborhood’s hydrology emerges. Where are a neighborhood’s underground streams? Storage reservoirs? Contamination sites? Storm drains? Where are the best places to capture stormwater and sink it into the ground? Where are the best places to divert it elsewhere? 
 • Full-scale transformational community events, including large-scale graphics and video projections will temporarily transform and celebrate visions generated during workshops. With spaces occupied and tested by cyclists, strollers, vendors, business owners, and community members, participants will evaluate: how is this working? What would I change? 
 
 Through Connect the Dots, the people of Los Angeles’s watersheds will:
 • visualize and appreciate the aquifers beneath their streets;
 • understand the role design plays in replenishing them; and
 • participate in shaping direction for water-smart investments.","For CtD to have widespread impact beyond the reach of Great Streets pilot projects and partnerships underway in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, CtD needs to have strong relationships in diverse neighborhoods. CtD plans to work with ALI Latrobe team + public partners to identify and prioritize neighborhoods acc to hydrologic and social equity metrics, and build relationships with community dev’t orgs and Neighborhood Councils, leveraging existing relationship with Great Streets Office.
 
 A second major barrier is of course, cost. To maximize efficiencies for temporary installations, CtD will invest in building a palette of flat, transportable elements that abstractly evoke a range of possible installations and best practices. Large-scale printed images on banners, temporary site lighting and projected imagery with digital content can be customized for each workshop location. This kit-of-parts approach is designed to be economical, adaptable, scaleable, and replicable.","Post-event, CtD coordinates analysis and synthesis of data and generates written and visual design and policy recommendations, for review by community partners and stakeholders and advocacy to decision-makers. We will evaluate our work based on numbers of event participants (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 100 participants per workshop); numbers of design educators and professionals involved as volunteers (2016 goal: 3 workshops @ 20 design volunteers each); responsiveness to synthesis recommendations (2016 goal: 3 workshop reports reviewed by professional design teams; presented to 3 communities @ 15 community leaders; and submitted to public agencies).","CtD’s approach is unique in its application of art and design to deliver cutting-edge science with the potential to shape demonstration projects and public policy. CtD has the support of the prize-winning Drylands Resilience Initiative team, drawn from across sectors and disciplines (ALI, Perkins+Will, Arup, and City of LA Bureau of Engineering). CtD is a corps of first-users of the Drylands Resilience Initiative’s stormwater decision-making tool, Hazel.
 
 While much wonderful arts-related effort is currently concentrated around reclaiming the LA River as civic space; and much water-supply effort is currently underway by engineers, public utilities, and wholesalers, CtD integrates design thinking into the key to water-resilience: localization of water supply as a distributed, multi-faceted design challenge, integrated into the surfaces of our buildings, streets, landscapes, and city. CtD blurs the distinction between arts and utility, and between river and basin, and recognizes that a resilient water supply will need to be embraced by neighborhoods throughout the watershed, in inspiring and surprising ways.
 
 CtD is also unique in its leadership team: a blend of architects, landscape architects, public artists and successful non-profit managers with drylands design expertise who have hosted large-scale, transformational community events here and in other cities.","CtD funding leverages existing partnerships in place.
 
 Research: CtD’s works closely with the Arid Lands Institute’s research team, including ALI, Perkins+Will, Arup, and City of LA Bureau of Engineering, to provide high-resolution stormwater data and to prioritize neighborhoods thirsty for public investment in quality public space. CtD also actively consults stormwater plans produced by LA County Flood Control, LA DWP, and City of LA Bureau of Sanitation. 
 
 Outreach: CtD Engagement Strategist will make every effort to coordinate outreach and public events with initiatives underway at FoLAR; Water LA/River Project; Trust for Public Land; NorthEast Trees; TreePeople; Ciclavia; Pacoima Beautiful; LACounty Bike Coalition, LAUSD, and others. 
 
 Design Expertise: CtD will invite wide participation by volunteers in the design professionals through the American Institute of Architects | LA and leverage existing alliances with design firms throughout the basin. Firms that have supported CtD development and pilot projects include Production Resources Group; Lehrer Architects; agps; Mia Lehrer + Associates; Roto Architects; Perkins+Will, Rios Clementi Hale; ACMartin; Predock Architects; John Kaliski Architects; (M)Arch Studio; and others.
 
 Policy Impacts: CtD, working with student teams from multiple university design programs, will share vision and policy recommendations with community development organizations, neighborhood councils, and city and county-wide watershed development initiatives. CtD will work to advocate for optimal hydrologic function within the Great Streets Initiative and beyond.
 
 Funding will be dedicated to expanding pilot programs already held in Pacoima (summer 2015) and Van Nuys (Feb 2016); design and fabrication of workshop kit elements; neighborhood outreach and volunteer recruitment; and the creative time of CtD principals.","$100,000 is an appropriate budget for pilot expansion described above.

5102015,Connected Communities – Resilient LA!,2015008,,,"We will connect LA’s most vulnerable communities on a neighbor-to-neighbor and community-to-community level through the power of volunteerism. New neighborhood networks and community coalitions will coalesce around the issue of preparedness for home fires. These efforts will lead to a more inter-connected LA with more resilient and prepared individuals and communities, for any type of disaster large or small, especially in vulnerable, low-income communities.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,ALL,"Knowing your neighbors and being engaged in your community creates the social connectedness we all need to live productive, healthy and fulfilled lives. This belonging and the active participation in civic life are important values in and of themselves. But what happens when disaster strikes? In particular, what happens if you are poor, without insurance or financial security and live in a vulnerable area? Then the lack of community and belonging as well as financial means can spell complete devastation. When your apartment burns down, you want to know your neighbors, be part of a larger community network and prepared to respond and then recover after the smoke clears. The effects of disasters large and small are exponentially worse for poorer communities. Families struggling to pay rent are less likely to store resources, own a car and have a safe space to stay in an emergency. At the same time, low-income communities are much more likely to be struck by disaster in the first place, considering housing conditions, including construction quality, heating and electrical wiring, is often not up to standard. ARCLA is acutely aware of these disparities as the vast majority of fires we respond to are in vulnerable neighborhoods where underserved residents (most of our disaster relief clients) find themselves in an extremely precarious position after a residential fire, often teetering on the precipice of homelessness and abject poverty.
 In response, the Red Cross developed a unique campaign to prevent home fires and increase community resilience with a focus on low-income areas most vulnerable to disaster. We commissioned a study to rank each of LA’s communities according to disaster vulnerability. Those ranking highest are the focus of this initiative. Striving for increased community resilience, the program is based on working with coalitions of community stakeholders to install smoke alarms and provide fire and disaster safety education through home visits. Neighbor-to-neighbor, community-to-community, a coalition of volunteers, staff and our community partners will work together within vulnerable communities across LA to strengthen resilience and save lives.
 Overall, the project will forge real interconnectedness and community resilience from the ground up through the power of volunteerism, while working to ensure that a resilient LA continues to be a place for all to connect, learn, create, play and live in, even after disaster, inevitably, strikes.","Most LA residents understand that disasters happen frequently, including home fires. Very few, however, turn this knowledge into preparedness action. The community canvassing approach is effective because receiving information directly in your community or from a peer resonates and seeing a neighbor take action inspires to do the same. 
 Another challenge is the pace of coalition-building. Fortunately, our partnership with the LA Department of Public Health (DPH) is already addressing this. Its LA County Community Disaster Resiliency, a 3-year campaign focused on community coalition-building to strengthen resilience from a health perspective, ended in June. We participated quarterly over the past year to create a transition plan for 6 of their coalitions to work with ARCLA (6 DPH-targeted communities overlap with the 15 ARCLA-targeted communities). Working with groups already focused on resiliency-building in their communities will help create trust and collaboration from the outset.","We will employ several formative and summative tools throughout the initiative’s duration. Quantitative and qualitative data will be compiled quarterly with a comprehensive report produced bi-annually. Progress will be monitored by a staff committee monthly and a Board committee quarterly. 
 Major outcomes include:
 Implement a coalition-driven preparedness effort based on home fire preparedness and installing 2,500 smoke alarms in each of the 5 targeted communities (Van Nuys, El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East LA), reaching 20,000 residents.
 Measurable outputs to be tracked include:
 -Number of households canvassed
 -Number of home visits
 -Number of smoke alarms installed
 -Number of smoke alarm battery replacements conducted
 -Number of households trained in smoke alarm testing and maintenance
 -Community-based coalitions: Collaborate with at least 15 new partners 
 -Conduct follow-up every 6 months to provide additional support as residents implement their preparedness plans","We collaborate with a wide variety of organizations and are active members of a large number of coalitions working on emergency management and safety issues. Our approach, however, of creating greater resiliency throughout LA by first targeting the most vulnerable communities through a broad preparedness campaign anchoring in prevention of home fires, a daily threat, is unique.","While responsibility for the overall Home Fire Preparedness strategy and implementation lies with ARCLA, we are only able to achieve our goals with the support from and continuous collaboration with a large number of important partner organizations. The largest coalition partners to date include: LA County Fire Department, Long Beach C.E.R.T, Los Angeles C.E.R.T.,Hope Worldwide, LA City Fire Department, Long Beach Fire Department, and the University of Southern California. The following on-going partnerships will also support the implementation of our project: Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management, Neighborhood Councils and Emergency Network Los Angeles. These partners offer additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs and services, serve in a program advisory capacity, help identify new community volunteers and work to identify Neighborhood Councils and community-based organizations as potential coalition partners. Three factors critical to the success of these collaborations are: shared mission; continual dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and training programs. These relationships are collaborative in nature and do not encompass redistribution of grant funding as the majority of the material costs are absorbed by the Red Cross.","Since the Home Fire Campaign is volunteer-led, the largest expenses will revolve around a percentage of its staff management, meeting costs, smoke alarms, installation kits, printing and travel. 
 
 The total projected annual cost will be approximately $1,000,000. We will make up the remaining $900,000 through funding from individual donors, foundations as well as corporate and government partners.","Salary (% of Preparedness program staff)  $30,000
 Community and coalition meeting costs $5,000 
 Supplies (smoke alarms, installation kits)  $60,000 
 Printing   $5,000","The Los Angeles Home Fire Campaign is part of a larger, four-year campaign. The project design includes reaching a total of 15 targeted communities, which rank very high on the vulnerability index specifically created for this effort. This first year will focus on five of the 15 high-risk and vulnerable communities: Van Nuys, South El Monte/El Monte, Koreatown, Paramount and East Los Angeles (Belvedere, City Terrace and Eastmont). The strategic plan for the campaign further involves working with area community groups and volunteers and canvassing the neighborhoods to conduct a minimum of 500 smoke alarm installations and family preparedness plans in each designated community (totaling at least 2,500 annually). By beginning with the five of the 15 focus communities listed above during the first, growing it by five additional neighborhoods in the second year (San Fernando, Rosemead, South San Gabriel/San Gabriel, Bell/Bell Gardens, Compton/East Compton, South Los Angeles: Exposition Park, Vermont Square and Leimert Park) and then scaling it to the full 15 communities by the end of the third project year (Pacoima, Pomona, Huntington Park/Walnut Park, Wilmington, Westlake/Pico Union), the initiative will have been scaled to cover a vast portion of LA County by the end of the campaign’s third year. 
 
 Once it has expanded into all 15 communities, year four of the effort will revolve around coalition capacity building, including running a series of coalition convenings, resulting in a stronger network of community coalitions throughout Los Angeles County. The work proposed here will cover year one of the proposed initiative and will be scaled citywide as outlined by the end of its four-year duration."

The trainings will include how to connect to free wireless networks and use apps on their phones including JobsLA, GoMetro, MyLA 311. We will also show workers how to use social media apps to connect to their government representatives and local neighborhood councils. These trainings will be conducted in and around the seven day labor centers in the City of Los Angeles. While the digital divide may be closing, with more people accessing mobile technology, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to knowing how to access city services including how to catch a bus to a job, who their City Council member is, and when the next neighborhood council meeting is. Additionally, many people worry about accessing information on their cell phones because of the high cost of data access. This is why teaching people where they can access free wifi in Los Angeles is critical. According to a 2008 study we conducted in five day labor centers in Los Angeles we found that most workers (78%) owned mobile phones and used them on a regular basis. A
 majority of the respondents reported using their phones primarily for work purposes and also to contact friends and family in other countries. We discovered that phone models and plans varied greatly, as did usage of specific phone features such as text, video, and photos. Interestingly, many workers knew how to
 take photos using their mobile phones but did not know how to send these to others others. Mobile tech has changed much since 2008 and we would additionally like to use this opportunity to assess low immigrant worker access to mobile phones and their use of civic tech. We would also like to create a mobile phone lending library, that would allow worker members to ""check out"" a smart phone while they are at a worker center. They can use this phone to contact an employer or use one of the city apps. This would have the dual purpose of increasing access to smart phone tech, allow workers to practice skills they learned in trainings, and access city information and services.","One of the major challenges/barriers we anticipate is that because of the temporary nature of work opportunities for many low wage immigrant workers, we may not have all the workers attend consecutive trainings. There are multiple strategies for overcoming this: 1- conducting the workshops on an ongoing basis including follow up visits, 2- creating a train the trainers model that will have at least one worker who is well versed in using mobile technology who can act as a resource for workers in between workshops sessions, and 3 leaving visuals (ie posters,pamphlets) with instructions on how to access certain apps and tools on cell phones in the worker centers where we conduct workshops.","One way we will evaluate our work will be via pre and post surveys. The pre surveys will assess how many workers across the seven day labor centers currently access City of LA services on their mobile phones and why or why not (i.e. didn't know how, was afraid to, don't have wi-fi, don't have cell phone, didn't know I could). At the end of 6 months of training, we will conduct a post survey to see if those numbers changed and the impact (jobs, shorter commute times, more participation in government).","I am not aware of other organizations doing similar work. What is unique about our proposed approached is that it directly meets low-income immigrant workers where they are at : physically in terms of locations where they are seeking work and other services and also in terms of access or lack there of to mobile tools. We believe that this approach will continue to prove that Los Angeles is a city that is all inclusive of immigrant community members. In 2008, IDEPSCA along with USC Annenberg School of Communications created an open source sms based storytelling platform for low wage immigrant workers. This model has been used globally.","IDEPSCA operates four of the seven day labor centers in the City of Los Angeles. All seven centers are funded by the City of Los Angeles and monitored by the Los Angeles Economic & Workforce Development Department. Together, IDEPSCA, with the other organizations that operate day labor centers in the City of LA : CARECEN and YPI, have developed a shared strategic vision for the day labor centers to transform them into wrap around service centers that serve not just day laborers, but their families and neighbors. A portion of this includes immigrant integration. While the other organizations will not receive funding, it is our hope that we will be able to leverage this funding so that each center can have a mobile literacy project. Additionally, IDEPSCA has a close relationship with the MIT Center for Civic Media, which we will consult with throughout the project.","To launch and implement the training program for one year will cost $100,000","S A L A R I E S

A pilot program concentrating on businesses, venues, organizations and individuals connected to the arts in each of the 7 council districts in the San Fernando Valley will be developed first. This will allow us to concentrate on one area of Los Angeles, where we can map out a specific region and build an overall template which can then be applied to each individual council district or independent city within Los Angeles County. By using the council districts of each area, we can involve each council member with the mapping and gathering of information for their own particular district.
 
 The research portion of this program will start with the Director of Information pulling together a volunteer committee to research and collect extensive data within selected categories. Categories could include:
 • Theaters 
 • Galleries 
 • Museums
 • Performance Centers
 • Amusement Parks
 • Arts Organizations
 • Lectures & Poetry Readings
 • Art, Music & Dance Festivals
 • Murals
 • Workshops & Classes
 • Visual Artists
 • Musicians
 • Performance Artists
 
 We will hire a website designer and a data technician to create an expandable, user-friendly and informative “location” where the viewer can access current or future arts information and destinations.
 
 For the first year, the listing will be free. The coding within the website will be able to count how many hits each listing receives which will allow us to categorize each listing to determine the 2nd year fee. This will be a minimal yearly amount which will help us maintain and sustain the website. Online advertising will be the 3rd phase of the program as we continue to populate our database with ways to customize each listing’s advertising capabilities.
 
 We will be working with LA Metro to create a discount card for those going to a play, a concert or to see an art exhibit on a Metro bus. The Metro LAACE Art Discount Card will help move and connect people to arts destinations.
 
 Businesses will be able to access detailed and customized information for each business, venue, organization or individual connected to the arts.
 
 Our interactive website and database will connect Valley residents to arts, culture and entertainment and eventually expand into the greater Los Angeles area.","Collecting information and categorizing it for input into the database is only a part of the initial program. Follow through to make sure that the data is kept up to date is just as important. Everyone has experienced the frustration of accessing outdated information on the internet. Today information from the internet that is passed on through search engines may or may not be up to date, misinforming and misleading the user. We will implement a quality control feature which automatically e-mails a user-friendly survey every three months to make sure that the data imparted by the LAACE website is the newest and most recent there is. E-mail address kick-backs will be followed up with a phone call to determine if the listing is out of business or obsolete. This fundamental component will eliminate passing on misinformation and the risk of creating a dissatisfied user.","The evaluation will be a multi-step process to include:
 - Verification of information accuracy by the individual businesses/Individuals on the database through a feedback form.
 - Verification of full functionality of the website by independent check tests (by people other than those designing and setting up the website).
 - Feedback from selected businesses/Individuals on the utility of the website.
 - How many of the businesses/Individuals include us as a link on their websites.
 - How prominent we become on major search engines, so people can locate our website.","One could say that there are many businesses that are presenting the same information that we are, but most of them are limited in their scope or range as far as dissemination of detailed information for both the consumer and the business-to-business markets. Limitations or constraints could be geographical, lack of financial support for expanding and updating, or only related to one specific category (i.e. galleries only). There’s no doubt that our research team will be able to glean information from what’s already on the internet, but the success of the LAACE program will depend on the detailed information we can attach to each listing in the database.","The San Fernando Valley Arts & Cultural Center (SFVACC) will partner with The Valley Economic Alliance (TVEA) on the pilot program for this proposal. 
 
 The Valley Economic Alliance:
 
 The mission of The Valley Economic Alliance is to elevate the economic vitality and stability of our five-city region by assisting San Fernando Valley Business, Education, and Government Communities. 
 
 TVEA will be instrumental in helping us put together the database and technical structure of the website. We will be working closely with Kenn Phillips, President & CEO of TVEA, Michael Hadley, Economic Research Specialist and Keith McPherson, Director of Innovation & Digital Strategy. We estimate that $6,000 will be paid to TVEA for their help, use of their conference room for meetings, accessing Valley businesses related to the arts, introductions to the Valley’s 7 councilmembers and securing meetings with representatives from LA Metro, LA Tourism and the LA Department of Cultural Affairs.
 
 A Director of Information will be hired to organize volunteers who will handle the majority of the research for our database. Our plan is to organize a for-credit program to involve students from California State University, Northridge. This program can be applied to other universities which are connected to their respective council districts when we expand LAACE outside of the Valley.
 
 By combining our knowledge of graphics, marketing and branding with the TVEA’s connections to Valley businesses as well as Los Angeles leaders, the LAACE program will start making an impact as soon as we launch the program.","After consulting with some of our collaborators, we are estimating a cost of $70,000 for the pilot program.

 I think the college essay intimidates kids and totally stresses them out -- and I see repeated, common mistakes in essays that might be keeping kids from being accepted to the best college possible.

 Forty percent of carbon emissions in Los Angeles come from households. The Cool Blocks LA pilot program will directly address household-level behavior change while fostering long-term health and quality of life for Angelenos. It supports both LA2050’s and the Sustainable City pLAn’s vision for sustainability and resilience for LA, and builds on the knowledge of what can be achieved based on decades of experience furthering pro-social behavior change and community engagement.
  
 A cool block is the organizing unit for this social change initiative.
  
 In collaboration with Neighborhood Councils and Cool Block program creator David Gershon, the NCSA will facilitate the selection of 10 Cool Block neighborhoods and leaders at three Cool Block Cafe events. Each participating neighborhood will be supported in the formation of a Cool Block Team of neighbors who live on a single block or in the same building. Following in-person training of Cool Block Leaders, each team will meet nine times over a five-month period, for the shared purpose of supporting their peers’ desires to live healthy and sustainable lifestyles, improve personal and collective disaster resiliency, build social bonds, and enhance the livability of their block.
  
 Participants will select the actions that support their goals from a list of 112 actions provided in a companion book. Some actions will be completed as individuals, and others are collaborative and will be carried out by the Cool Block Team. 
  
 To address any challenges that arise and support desired outcomes, the NCSA will provide ongoing coaching to each Cool Block Team.
  
 The program will culminate in a Cool Block Party to celebrate each Cool Block’s achievements.
  
 Following completion of the Cool Blocks LA pilot, the NCSA will host a debriefing session with Cool Block Leaders to capture successes and lessons learned and begin planning for a broader rollout in Year 2.
 
 One benefit of the program is the generation of social capital within Cool Blocks, leading to stronger networks and more livable and resilient communities. Also, this grassroots-level effort will heighten the demand for politicians to effect relevant public policy changes.","Behavior change (and particularly the changes we must make to effectively address climate change) is notoriously difficult to achieve.
 
 This model is an evidence-based approach that incorporates social and environmental psychology principles and that has been demonstrated to achieve sustained behavior change.
 
 The primary principles that are built into the model and that ensure its effectiveness include:
 social norms
 community support
 incentives
 commitment
 prompts
 convenience
 accountability
 social diffusion
 
 Mr. Gershon will provide extensive training and ongoing coaching to the program administrators and Cool Block Leaders to ensure that the principles are executed, which will also reduce attrition of program participants.
 
 Any unforeseen barriers will be addressed in future iterations of the program once the pilot is complete.","Actions taken by participating households and blocks will be measured by
 carbon pollution avoided
 resiliency and livability
 program growth
 number of actions taken
 
 Points will also be awarded for the qualitative contributions of 
 collaboration
 sharing
 participation
 leadership
 social innovation
 mastery
 This will help each team focus on the key performance indicators necessary for their success and the program’s growth.
 
 In consultation with Mr. Gershon, the NCSA will design, implement, and analyze pre and post surveys related to the above measures.
 
 The NCSA will also measure and report on such outputs as: 
 block leader recruitment rates
 participation rate per neighborhood
 number of LA residents and partners reached through Cool Block program education and outreach efforts
 
 Finally, we will measure environmental outcomes that include carbon pollution reduction and water savings per household, using online calculator tools.","The NCSA is the first organization in the City of Los Angeles to systematically bring together Neighborhood and Community Councils—hubs of civic engagement in LA, representing nearly 100 communities—to achieve collective impact on local sustainability and resilience issues.

 Our plan is to pilot the program in “early adopter” LA neighborhoods in Year 1 while growing a solid Cool Block program foundation and developing trained Cool Block leaders who can support follow-on work. We will then be poised to expand the Cool Block program exponentially in Years 2 and 3.
 
 Cool Blocks are designed to engage in a web of mutual support with surrounding blocks, and through this mechanism have been shown to not only sustain behavior change, but expand it. Cool Neighborhoods can be created out of 10 adjacent Cool Blocks. The benefits of scale include such things as solar installations that serve entire neighborhoods and community carbon offset program to invest in local renewable energy or urban forestry projects.
 
 In alignment with the Sustainable City Plan and the LA2050 Vision and Goals, our long-term goal is to engage 15% of City of LA households in the Cool Block program—a demonstrated tipping point for social change.
 
 By the end of Year 3, Los Angeles will be in an ideal position to serve as a candidate for an upcoming “Cool Cities Challenge,” a $2.5 million initiative with 20 California cities leading the way to a healthy carbon future by 2020."

""Council"" is a circle form of dialogue that builds trust, understanding, and awareness, and that fosters engaged, compassionate school communities. We propose to work with teachers, staff, students, and families at six Los Angeles public schools (see below) to implement council and ""restorative practices"" programs and to collaborate on the design and construction of a dedicated council space at one of those schools.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Gardner St. Elem. School, LAUSD, Hollywood; Valor High School, Panorama City; Valor Middle School, North Hills; Rise Kohyang Middle School, Koreatown; Stella Middle School, South LA; Bright Star Secondary High School, South LA",ALL,"Learning is a relational process. Research shows relationship affects every aspect of students’ mental and physical health and academic achievement. Studies document the impact on absenteeism, self-esteem, bullying, aggression, violence, sexual harassment, substance abuse, psychological well-being, rates of suspension and expulsion, motivation to learn, academic achievement, graduation rates…and more. “A Review of School Climate Research,” Thapa, et al. (2013) Review of Educational Research.
 Many students feel alienated, disengaged, fear, and mistrust at school. Underachievement, drop-out, bullying, violence, and burnout are the byproducts. Perhaps ironically, the explosion of electronic communication, social networking, and virtual connectedness often exacerbates the lack of real connection so many feel.
 It doesn't have to be this way. The processes that shape relationships in schools are essential. Council is a structured process of communication that helps participants connect with themselves and others and that provides space for emotional, social, and moral development alongside the mental and physical. It is an instructional strategy to explore themes and topics from the academic curriculum and make the academic relevant to students’ lives. It is an inclusive process that promotes an environment of trust and respect. It is a mindfulness practice that helps students become more aware of themselves and others and more adept at managing emotions and behavior. It is a leadership tool to harvest the collective wisdom of a group and take informed action. It is a community-building tool and the foundation for a “restorative justice” approach to school discipline.
 Holding a council involves a few basic elements, the main ones being sitting in a circle – where all are equal and everyone can see and be seen; using a talking piece – to focus attention and shift habitual ways of listening and speaking; and practicing the intention to listen and speak “from the heart.” Simple as the process is, it's power to connect transforms schools and lives.
 Last year we started council and restorative practices programs with the 6 schools that are part of this proposal. The impact was profound and the schools all committed to making these practices core parts of their school cultures. We want to provide two more years of training and mentoring, at which point the schools will be able to sustain their council and restorative practices programs with minimal support.","Council and RP are good for students, educators, schools, families, and communities, as confirmed by evidence that use of these practices has reduced suspensions and expulsions, decreased incidence of bullying, increased feelings of safety and belonging, raised GPAs, and increased teacher job satisfaction. While the benefits are clear and compelling, establishing and sustaining circle practices shifts school culture and shakes up the status quo, and can be met with fear, resistance, and uncertainty. Success requires visionary school leaders willing to invest time and resources to make relational practices a school-wide priority. Having worked with the Bright Star and Gardner leaders last year, we chose them for this project confident they will help make it a success.
 Building the council space at Gardner will require obtaining district permission. We don't anticipate a problem and will rely on Gardner's principal and our architect partner, both experienced with similar projects.","We will use a combination of quantitive metrics and qualitative surveys to evaluate our work, including: attendance/truancy rates; suspension and expulsion rates; disciplinary referral rates; bullying complaint rates; rates of disciplinary incidents resolved through ""restorative practices""; standardized test scores; grade point average; students' perceived senses of safety, belonging, and fairness at school; students' reported level of engagement in school; and staffs' perceived senses of effectiveness, purpose, and solidarity at school.
 In addition, we want to collaborate on devising better metrics that more meaningful reflect the short and long-term impact of our work.","Council in Schools and The Ojai Foundation have been bringing council into Los Angeles schools for over 30 years have been the only organization doing this work. Over the last few years, restorative practices have emerged as an alternative to traditional school discipline processes, which are often punitive, exclusionary, and ineffective. 
 Like council, restorative justice has its roots in the ways of indigenous peoples and involves a facilitated circle form of dialogue. 
 As providers have emerged to meet the burgeoning demand for restorative practices in schools, they recognized that circles are not effective if they are used only to address problems and to restore community when harm has been caused. Rather, circles must also be used to build community. If community has not been built, then there is nothing to restore when things go wrong. Restorative practices organizations have begun developing their own versions of council, which go by a variety of names, such as ""morning meeting"" and ""community circle."" Other organizations providing restorative practices training and implementation to Los Angeles schools include: the California Conference for Equality and Justice, Community Matters, and Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth.
 While other organizations have begun doing work similar to council, our approach remains unique. With a history of success bringing council into schools, CIS has a team of experienced council trainers and a library of council curriculum. Unlike other community-building circle processes, which frequently ask participants to share their feelings or opinions on issues, council prompts typically elicit stories from participants' lived experience, as it is the sharing of story that best evokes our compassion for one another, not our opinions nor even our feelings if they don't include our story. We have also developed plans and templates to help educators integrate council into both the academic and social-emotional lives of students. Whereas other organizations often send their people to run community-building circles for teachers, we emphasize training and mentoring so that teachers and administrators take ownership of their councils themselves and the school becomes self-sufficient. We also offer council-based retreats at The Ojai Foundation and other locations where participants can deepen their practice by withdrawing from the city for a day or a weekend and reconnecting with the natural world.","Our partners/collaborators on this project will be:

 We are also at a time in our cultural development when the power and value of circle practices are being remembered. With the growth of the restorative justice movement, there is growing demand for the work we do. We expect the success of this project will create more demand for our services. The Bright Star organization is doing amazing work with severely underserved populations in some of LA's most difficult communities, and council is playing a big part in their success. Opportunities to work with other charter schools are and will continue emerging from our work with Bright Star.

Using a new app developed by CSUN, teachers can make learning more interactive and dynamic by strategically guiding students toward making their own discoveries of various math concepts. The app, unlike static pages in a textbook, will allow students to explore and see connections between different ways to represent math ideas. If they want to explore how much money they can earn or how many songs they can download, they can see it visually at their fingertips. Using the app, teachers can work in teams to plan the next day’s lesson, focusing on student learning and not just getting through a textbook.
 
 The app will also be a transformative tool for teachers. It will help them design and implement lesson activities that focus on exploring the relationships between various representations of math concepts and real-world applications. Teachers will be able to work collaboratively to ensure students understand by creating lessons that meet the learning needs of all their students.
 
 The app design is based on lesson activities developed from previously funded work, which has led to significantly higher student scores on state test scores in mathematics. These students were from low-income, primarily Hispanic communities in Los Angeles. With the app as an additional resource, the Project Director expects students will post even higher standardized test scores in math.
 
 The Project Director is Dr. Ivan Cheng, a faculty member in the CSUN Michael D. Eisner College of Education. Over the past 5 years, he was awarded grants from both the State of California Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education to support teachers in making math accessible for all students.
 
 Dr. Cheng’s goal is to make sure every student gets quality instruction in math and that every teacher is supported in providing quality instruction for their students. Funding is needed to provide training to help more teachers get through to their students.","One key challenge for the implementation of this project is recruiting enough teachers to make a difference. Our strategy is to work closely with all levels of leadership within Los Angeles Unified School District. We have already secured unanimous approval from the Board of Education and from the directors of mathematics instruction in LAUSD. We have already met with some local superintendents and directors in LAUSD, as well as all of the secondary math coordinators in the district. What we need now is to get the word out to all the teachers in Los Angeles so that they can take advantage of this exciting opportunity to make math accessible to all their students.","Dr. Cheng will work with the CSUN Center for Assessment, Research and Evaluation (CARE) to evaluate the impact of the CREATE Project on student achievement. Dr. Cheng will answer the following evaluation questions: 
 1. What is the impact of the app on student learning?
 2. To what extent do teachers engage in use of the app in their practice during the year?
 3. What barriers to implementation are identified and what are the lessons learned?
 This evaluation will guide improvement in the design of the app and in the training provided for the teachers. It will also provide important data to improve math education across the nation.","The design of our app is distinctly different from all the online tutorial programs that simply focus on mastering procedures without developing an understanding of mathematical connections. Instead, our app provides a tool for teachers to help them create learning activities that make math make sense for students. Our approach is unique in that it provides teachers the power and flexibility to address the diverse learning needs of their students quickly and frequently in ways that no textbook can. In short, it allows teachers to adjust instruction to fit the needs of their students.","Our project partner is the Los Angeles Unifies School District. LAUSD teachers will receive $38,000 in stipends.","The total cost of the project is $100,000.","LA2050 funds will be used to offset the cost of training for 60–100 teachers in LAUSD. Specifically funds will cover the cost of conference training facilities/food and refreshments ($49,000) and stipends for participants ($38,000). The remainder ($13,000) is the mandatory service fee of 26% that CSUN applies to all off-campus, externally funded projects. This service fee covers the cost of administration, payroll, and facilities.","As one of the largest teacher preparation universities in California, CSUN is well positioned to build upon its success at increasing pupil achievement in California public schools by further developing and bringing this intervention to scale. One key way that CREATE can impact teaching and pupil student achievement at scale is through the preparation of additional high-quality teachers in mathematics. In doing so, CREATE will be able to inform the work of the Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (MTEP), sponsored by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), which serves 69 universities and 87 school districts across 30 states, as well as all 23 universities in the California State University system. Furthermore, the app itself can help sustain changes in practice as more and more teachers embrace the guided discovery a new approach for teaching mathematics reaching their students. And with the increasing number of classrooms already equipped with tablets, the cost of providing the app would be minimal for schools in comparison with the cost of textbooks and other print resources."

More than 44% of all creative workers in California are located in our city and they contribute $80 billion to our economy directly. Creative occupations often require high levels of education and skills training in a particular discipline; in the case of craft furniture making, the occupation also requires the skill to run and grow a business. The furniture & decorative arts sector is expected to grow 11.5% over the next five years, but we need to give business owners in the craft furniture field the tools that they need to achieve this growth. 
 
 We propose to convene leading thinkers in the field for in-depth discussions about the obstacles to craft furniture making and ways to overcome them. Based on these conversations, we will create a small business toolkit for furniture makers. We will draw on experts from furniture production, product design, gallery sales, private collections, marketing, branding, business management, and the media. We will seek input from our community on topics of conversation, but initial ideas include product development, business management, media relations, social media, marketing strategies, client growth and management, sales strategies, and the role of craft in the 21st century. The thoughts and ideas that come out of these conversations will be accessible to our community through white papers, podcasts, and business support resources. 
 
 Our secondary goals are to:
 1) Improve and expand workshop offerings for professional furniture makers and the general public to empower the community to create and to elevate the craft of furniture making.
 2) Formalize and expand our pilot apprenticeship program to provide training and job placement in order to attract and retain creative talent.

Students from SPA 6 face a number of economic, environmental, and social challenges that have a direct impact on their wellbeing. Within SPA 6 there is a strong prevalence of foster care, gang-related activity, juvenile delinquency, and youth victimization. These issues create profound instability in our families and communities, fueling high school drop, unemployment, and immense incarceration rates. As a result, this continues to make it nearly impossible for our youth to meet their basic needs, reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering in the way of their success. FFSC wants to break that cycle by empowering children labeled as “disadvantaged” or “at-risk” to become leaders for themselves, their peers and their community. SCLP believes in every student’s capability to succeed when given access to all the necessary tools. SCLP consists of 5 modules that are 8 weeks in length. The modules expands our youth knowledge base by providing significant exposure to real-life work experiences, hands-on activities that challenge their decision making process, intense cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteer projects both locally and abroad.

 We will use the data we've collected over the last eleven years to analyze trends in our student population, donor base and communities. For example, we have discovered over the years that our program has evolved to provide services to students with learning disabilities and students whose parents were born abroad. We will also use this information to understand what communication channels are most effective, how to better raise funds and how to increase recurring giving.
 
 We will build on our success by tapping into new technology and innovation for community-based organizations. We will use new technology such as mobile devices, tablets and applications on each to more efficiently deliver our services to our target population. Staff and volunteers will have the data that we've collected over the last eleven years on our core population, students and communities at their fingertips. 
 
 We will also build on our strong network. Having a strong professional support network is crucial for the success of our Leadership Program. We will develop our network of staff, volunteers and community partners to invest in our vision and program. We will then leverage that human capital to grow the Leadership Program from a local program to a regional and national program. That also includes developing our social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to provide us additional access to other networks of potential donors, volunteers, members, alumni, patrons and supporters.
 
 We will also pay close to our finances. Most, if not all, nonprofits operate on a shoestring budget and our program is no different. We are thankful for every dollar and cent that comes into the organization and we will work hard to ensure that none of its is wasted, especially during the times of growth.

At least 4 neighborhoods (and potentially more who take advantage of the Cultural Economic Development Summit) will have an opportunity to create a cultural economic development plan and strategy that is anchored by strengthening current creative economy small businesses. It is widely recognized that the long-term success of such strategies will involve attracting tourists and visitors from outside the community. Many non-profits lack the relationships necessary to successfully externally market their cultural districts. On the other hand, the LA Convention and Visitor’s Bureau, LA, Inc and groups such as LA Film Locations have access to film and music sectors, tourism resources, support for special events and festivals, and strong marketing budgets. As the convener, LA LISC will be tasked with bringing these groups together.","LA LISC is seeking to engage stakeholders in a coordinated effort to develop cultural economic strategies. It is our hope to inspire the need for neighborhood and historic preservation of culture in demanding economic conditions. Success will be evaluated by the following metrics: 
 • 10 participant communities/commercial districts and neighborhoods in the Cultural Economic Development Summit (40-50 participants);
 • Four project partners implement an iconic cultural economic development idea from among their strategy during the grant period;
 • Four project partners complete inventory of small businesses that contribute to the cultural economy;
 • At least 20 businesses receive technical assistance to nurture their growth and development; and
 • At least 4 businesses receive financial assistance.","As far as LA LISC is aware, there are no other organizations in Los Angeles seeking to convene local leaders and stakeholders to support the development of cultural economic development strategies for key cultural magnets. LA LISC considers the work of partner organizations listed herein as complementary to the creation of cultural economic development strategies. Our approach is unique in that it increases knowledge on how arts and culture can drive the economic outcomes of an area, it has an emphasis on cross-community collaboration, and it is focused on nurturing and growing small businesses that make up the cultural identity of LA's diverse commercial hubs.","This project will involve partnership of at least four identified community organizations, with each receiving $10,000 of the total LA2050 Grant Award. The four partners are as follows: Coalition for Responsible Community Development, Little Tokyo Service Center, East Los Angeles Community Corporation and Leimert Park Village 20|20 Vision Initiative.","LA LISC expects that the project will cost $215,000. The additional costs will be covered by HUD Section 4 grant support secured by LISC to support commercial corridor development in Los Angeles ($75,000). The remaining balance will be raised from third party sources such as National LISC's Creative Placemaking strategy grants in partnership with the Kresge Foundation ($40,000).","Project Budget:
 $40,000 - This cost includes the portion of the budget available for Organizational Partnerships for Cultural District Planning and implementation of iconic activities (Economic revitalization strategies that integrate arts and culture typically involve facility-centric, people-oriented and/or program-based approaches. Each one of the pre-identified cultural magnet communities will be tasked to implement one activity to support their respective strategy.)
 
 $25,000 - This includes direct costs for Convening Summit on Cultural Economic Development Strategies and Opportunities (The summit will be open to a larger audience of Angeleno leaders who are grappling with external forces impacting the cultural vibrancy of commercial corridors. Moreover, the convening will be designed to encourage the forging of powerful partnerships across communities who are all seeking to achieve sustainability, cultural resilience and economic prosperity.) Direct costs include but are not limited to location, outreach/marketing, refreshments, speaker honorariums, meeting logistics (i.e. meeting printed materials and supplies).
 
 $35,000 - This cost includes overall program implementation and planning. Organizing the convening, providing technical assistance to partner groups to implement cultural economic development strategies, providing technical assistance to partner groups and small businesses to ensure access to capital, information and larger markets.","The success of the this project can be scaled by hosting annual convenings among cultural magnet communities in Los Angeles to share best practices and outcomes. The intensive technical assistance provided to the first four cultural magnet communities can be applied to other similar areas in Los Angeles. And finally, LA LISC is part of a national community economic development organization and successes from this pilot program can be further studied, documented and applied to other LISC offices across the country as best practices for seamlessly blending cultural economic development strategies, small business and regional cultural tourism plans."

 We’ve developed a series of programs dedicated to helping people transition from consumers to creators by recognizing problems, their potential solutions, and developing an entrepreneurial skill set that will make their efforts sustainable into the year 2050 and beyond. 
 
 Through partnership with experts in the fields of entrepreneurship at Loyola Marymount College of Business, civic leaders of the Youth Justice Coalition, and individuals who have started successful enterprises we will create and active community that moves from ideation and prototyping, to refinement and revenue. 
 
 We are taking the principles put to use in incubators and classrooms across the field and embedding them into the culture of our city through various communities in the transcending geography, age, and economic status.","Participation will be the biggest barrier to our program’s success. We need to get people in rooms together for the events to be impactful and on the website for our resources to be used. Not only will we need simply attendance but and engages community with projects to set inaction.
 
 We will overcome this obstacle by partnering with Loyola Marymount University and Youth Justice Coalition to help bridge gaps between disparate communities. Diversity will be built by collaborating with stakeholders in the artist, activist, and entrepreneurial sectors and extending that outreach to a range of geographic and cultural groups.
 
 Additionally we will make a concerted effort to target women and minorities, and a directly engage with formerly incarcerated
 
 An example would be to work with an organization that creates jobs for the previously incarcerated and co-produce an event that draws parallels between entrepreneurial basics and skills needed to find employment.","Success is defined for us by the:
 
 - Attendee participation expectation versus actual for each event.
 
 - Feedback from After Event Reviews by attendees (attendee rating system)
 
 - Analytics regarding impressions of content
 
 - Collection of useable data set regarding obstacles to entrepreneurial initiation and success (Why people are not starting businesses and why they are failing when they do.)
 
 - # Of business plans and new enterprises begun as a result of program.
 
 - Amount of Local and Major Press coverage gained","We are inspired by organizations like Catalyst Creative, General Assembly, and Creative Mornings that help entrepreneurs and creatives succeed but none have devoted the time and resource to seeking out so many that have yet to self identify as entrepreneurial.
 
 What makes Citizens Of Culture unique is its commitment to diversity and a broad definition of entrepreneur to include high growth start-up, small business, and sustainable non-profit. Our program not only services existing creatives but seeks out those who have yet to unlock their creativity.

5102017,Developing a Peer Mentorship Model in Juvenile Halls to Build a Healthier LA,2015010,,,"To make Los Angeles a healthier place to live for some of the city’s most vulnerable young people, ARC will expand and enhance its unique mentorship program for incarcerated youth by training additional formerly incarcerated members to serve as peer mentors, and developing a scalable model that can be replicated in additional juvenile facilities in the next three years.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, Camps Scott and Scudder",ALL,"ARC’s Support Network is made up of more than 225 formerly incarcerated members who commit to living crime-free, gang-free, and drug-free; enrolling in school or working; and being of service to the community and the ARC Network.
 
 Through this network, members reduce association with negative influences that can lead to criminal behavior and instead build healthy relationships with positive peers. The Coalition serves as a source of motivation and empowerment for members, who witness peers working hard to beat the odds and see the opportunities that result from that effort.
 
 While ARC matches members with adult mentors, it also offers members critical peer support from individuals who have been incarcerated and understand the challenges they are facing. The support they receive from one another is authentic, relevant, and effective. The recidivism rate of ARC members is less than five percent.
 
 Recognizing this, ARC recently developed a pre-release mentorship program to incarcerated youth in three Los Angeles County juvenile facilities: the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall, which houses youth charged as adults, and the Scott and Scudder Juvenile Camps for girls. ARC partnered with the Los Angeles County Probation Department to develop this program, which brings 10 formerly incarcerated members inside facilities on a weekly basis to serve as peer mentors to 110 incarcerated youth.
 
 To make LA the healthiest place to live for all of its residents, ARC will develop a scalable model to expand its pre-release mentorship program to additional juvenile facilities in LA, including Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls, and additional probation camps. ARC will develop a program curriculum, training materials for staff and mentors, an implementation manual and recommendations and best practices documents to promote program replication. 
 
 ARC will train 20 additional formerly incarcerated members to serve as peer mentors to prepare for expanding the program to two new locations and to enhance the pilot year of the program by providing more individualized support.
 
 Upon release, participants will receive re-entry support through ARC’s Membership Services which include post-release mentoring, case management, education assistance, internships, employment opportunities, support meetings, and housing opportunities.","To prepare for expanding its pre-release mentorship program in two additional juvenile halls, ARC will focus in the pilot year on developing a clear process with the Los Angeles County Probation Department for training mentors and ARC staff on facility regulations, and on handling potential issues such as mental health or medical crises. ARC will work closely with Probation to ensure buy-in from staff and administration, and to develop replicable procedures around all aspects of the Program, from bringing supplies and program materials into facilities to managing potential conflicts and issues. ARC will enhance its current Membership Services framework to include more robust case management. Reentry services offered through this enhanced model will continue to focus on the core components of ARC’s current model, emphasizing educational enrollment and success, workforce preparation, employment opportunity and the development of positive social networks through mentorship and the Network","ARC will utilize its partnerships with the Los Angeles County Probation Department and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to support data collection on program participants, as well as to gather additional information and statistics around Los Angeles County’s incarcerated population and its demographics.
 
 ARC’s Membership Services Director will oversee data collection, in close collaboration with ARC Case Managers and participating peer mentors. Data will be recorded in individual participant files and tracked through ARC’s secure member database. ARC will track the following performance measures: number of youth enrolled in services, number of youth exhibiting change in behavioral violations, substance abuse, gang activity and mental health, recidivism and reentry outcomes and probation violations, second and post-secondary education enrollment, job training and placement and connection to trauma-therapy and/or substance abuse treatment.","ARC’s pre-release mentorship program is unprecedented in the history of Los Angeles County Probation. This program offers incarcerated youth the opportunity to learn from and engage with peers who have experienced incarceration firsthand. Furthermore, mentors have also received support and services through ARC’s Membership Services and can best explain the benefits and value of the ARC Support Network. 
 
 ARC partner organization InsideOUT Writers (IOW) currently offers a pre-release creative writing program in the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall led by volunteer teachers. These writing programs promote positive peer interaction among incarcerated youth and provide a safe space for creativity and growth.
 
 IOW also offers an alumni program that provides case management to identify and address short and long term goals of formerly incarcerated alumni, post-release mentorship opportunities with adult volunteers to foster positively and healthy relationships, and life skills programming, including alumni writing circles. 
 
 ARC sees IOW’s pre-release creative writing classes as complimentary to ARC’s mentorship program, and IOW’s post-release reentry services as directly aligned with ARC’s service offerings and intends to collaborate with IOW to enhance this program.","To complete enhancements of ARC’s case management model, ARC will collaborate with Leaders in Community Alternatives, or an equally distinguished community-based services provider.
 
 To enhance recruitment and matching elements of its post-release mentorship services, ARC will partner with the Los Angeles Federation of Labor, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Warner Brothers Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, two local law firms and various other community leaders and organizations to recruit additional mentors who work in careers that are of particular interest to current ARC members.
 
 Finally, to enhance the pre-release mentorship program curriculum and post-release reentry services, and to recruit and refer mentorship program participants and new members, ARC will partner with InsideOUT Writers.","ARC estimates that developing a scalable model and expanding the pre-release mentorship program to an additional two juvenile facilities by 2017 will cost approximately $100,000. Funding will be used to provide stipends and travel for additional mentors, to hire consultants to oversee expansion and evaluation of the pilot program and to develop program materials and guides. Funding will also be used to work with a partner organization to enhance ARC’s current case management model in order to prepare to serve additional members as participants in the pre-release mentorship program are released.","BUDGET
 Mentors/Facilitators $24,000
 Training/Administration $20,000
 Supplies/Materials $19,000
 Consultants  $10,000
 Transportation  $10,000
 Reentry Services/Case Management $17,000 
 Total  $100,000","With this funding, ARC will focus on creating a structured, managed and tracked pre-release mentorship program, and developing a model that can be taken into additional juvenile facilities over the next three to five years. 
 
 ARC will utilize its membership of 225 successful formerly incarcerated individuals to recruit and train additional peer mentors.
 
 ARC will utilize its close relationship with Chief Probation Officer Jerry Powers and Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice Michael Minor to facilitate access into new facilities with a specific focus on implementing the program at Eastlake and Los Padrinos Juvenile Halls and additional Probation Camps.
 
 Eventually, once the model is developed and has been implemented successfully at Probation facilities, ARC will look to expand the program to three State Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) facilities through a partnership with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
 
 Because program participants will be served by ARC’s current Support Network upon release, a large focus of planning for expanding the program will concentrate on enhancing ARC's current Membership Services framework through the development of more robust case management services. ARC will enhance programming around supporting cognitive and behavioral issues, as well as providing additional support for trauma and substance abuse."
5102046,Dial for English on the Go,2015027,,,"Cell-Ed aims to narrow educational divides in LA County by offering over 1000 households with low literacy levels 24/7 mobile learning access to English language and life skills. Dialing a Cell-Ed number from any mobile phone, these parents and their school-age children will be able reach and complete award-winning Cell-Ed’s literacy and language programs in the palms of their hands.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"“To study all I needed to do was call and I’d be studying within one second- and anytime! I liked the conversations and tips to help me understand and pronounce English,” Briseida, who achieved 97% proficiency using Cell-Ed 
 
 Imagine the challenge of reading a note your child brings home from school or taking high-school tests in math and reading or applying for a job when you simply cannot understand the material you are reading. This literacy problem impacts over 3.8M Angelenos who lack the skills to navigate school, daily life, and today’s labor market. The majority are members of Spanish-speaking households with low levels of literacy.
 
 Low literacy skills are directly linked to higher unemployment rates, lower incomes, and poor health that impact the entire household. In fact, a child who does not read proficiently by the 3rd grade is four times more likely to leave high school without a diploma. 
 
 To meet the promise of LA2050, Cell-Ed aims to raise household literacy levels for hundreds of low literate Spanish-speaking parents and their children in Los Angeles County. Parents with higher literacy and educational skills tend to value education of their children, utilize early education services more, and encourage their children to stay in school and reach higher levels of education. In this way, Cell-Ed can impact multiple ‘’LA2050 Learn” metrics over time by increasing two generation family literacy skills. 
 
 Not only was Cell-Ed born, piloted and proven effective in Los Angeles County, we have partner networks ready to offer Cell-Ed to these households for free, including social service organizations and labor unions. 
 
 Dialing a Cell-Ed number from any mobile phone, parents and their school-age children can reach award-winning Cell-Ed’s literacy and language programs – Learn to Read and English on the Go Levels 1–4 – and achieve English proficiency in the palms of their hands. 
 
 By improving the education and skills of these households, together we can help to reverse the trend in falling wages of low-earning workers, reduce income inequality, lower wage gaps, reduce poverty, and improve child well being. Addressing this gap would certainly make LA an even better place to learn for all Angelenos.
 
 Sources: US Census, First5LA, La Workforce Literacy Project, Cell-Ed","Cell-Ed anticipates two challenges: reaching hard to reach households and offsetting costs for learners. 
 
 To address the first, we rely on a cascading network of service organizations that serve families with low levels of literacy. For LA, this includes WIC LA, LAPL, SEIU and NDWA and our content partners, Centro for Latino Literacy, Building Skills Partnership and UCLA.
 
 Our second challenge is to underwrite the costs of Cell-Ed. Currently we provide Cell-Ed as a service for a $50 per user license fee. Clients include the states of New York and Texas who buy licenses for low literate and immigrant learners. The LA 2050 Learn grant would underwrite delivery of Cell-Ed to 1000 households. Cell-Ed is always free to learners with unlimited talk and text plans, but for those without (<5%), we will work with telecom partners to offset costs (e.g. MetroPCS).","Cell-Ed has a two-part monitoring and evaluation approach. For all of our partners, we:
 
 1) Evaluate Learning Outcomes: We expect that learners will demonstrate increased literacy after completing the Cell-ED program and provide pre- and post-test assessments.
 
 2) Monitor Learners’ Experiences with Cell-ED: It is important to monitor learners’ experiences with Cell-Ed and be responsive to their needs. Fortunately, the platform includes a learner management system that automatically captures important data points. Key Performance Indicators include: 
 
 • Average error per module
 • Time to completion
 • Number of coach interventions per learner
 • Logging when learners access Cell-ED 
 
 3) In addition, each learner is tracked by a Cell-Ed live learning coach who gets feedback via live calls and two way texting and who tracks progress for each learner, including attainment and well being assessments.","Cell-Ed is the only education technology provider to deliver literacy and English language instruction for Spanish-speaking populations with low literacy levels, over any type of mobile phone. 
 
 Other education technology providers, both private and public, deliver Internet or data dependent programs over computers or mobile apps, which limits access. For example, USALearns delivers basic ESL training for immigrant populations, but is English only and web-based. DuoLingo, another popular provider of language learning, offers Spanish speakers English lessons for free but is only available via app or web and for learners who have higher levels of education. 
 
 For those that are not technology dependent, literacy and English language learning options span library systems, private and public schools, non-profit organization and employers. The single largest provider - Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) operates more than a dozen literacy related programs servicing over 400,000. What these programs have in common are low completion rates (~20-50%), due to students missing classes due to work and childcare demands, lack of time, sleep, confidence, and transportation
 
 Cell-Ed is unique for a number of reasons, including that it’s:
 
 Proven effective for low-literacy learners- In our LA County pilot, learners leaped two years – in about four months – when they completed our adult literacy course. They also showed high adherence (75%) to the course, a startling jump from classroom settings
 (20- 50%) and gained the confidence to learn more.
 
 Easy to use - A learner 1) calls a Cell-Ed number 2) listens to a teacher’s voice lesson with corresponding text and 3) texts back responses, receives additional help from a live coach or continues with the next lesson. 
 
 Accessible – Learners are far more likely to own a basic cell phone than a computer. Internet access is not required for Cell-Ed’s programs. And being forced to commute to a classroom or community center to use a computer can cause the same transportation and time obstacles that so often stymie classroom-based learning.
 
 Empowering –Cell-Ed provides private learning system paced to you. Graduates state that they have a sense of personal achievement and pride as well as feeling better educated and more confident when filling out job applications, tax forms and other documents.","An LA2050 grant would allow Cell-Ed to offer and distribute English on the Go to 1000 households with low literacy levels in Los Angeles County through ready partners, free of cost:
 
 ● Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Los Angeles: Cell-Ed would expand reach and access to literacy programs to support 500 families affiliated with WIC LA, a federally-funded health and nutrition program serving over 300,000 per month across 60 centers in LA County.

 Second, we will work to expand partnership with additional organizations that directly serve households with low-literacy in LA County, including: 
 
 1) Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Adult Education Office
 2) Head Start-State Preschool division of the Los Angeles County Office of Education 
 3) Southern California Library Literacy Network (SCLLN) 
 4) 2-1-1- United Way-funded helpline that connects people in need with essential health and human services
 
 Third, we will seek to become an approved provider recommended by the Outreach and Technical Assistance Network for Adult Educators (OTAN) for California. Currently, we have this state level status with the State of New York that licenses Cell-Ed for immigrants associated with their 27 Office for New American Opportunity Centers. In addition, Cell-Ed is an approved distance learner for the State of Texas, which provides Cell-Ed access to adult schools and community based organizations serving Spanish- speaking populations. 
 
 Fourth and lastly, to promote adult literacy and the need for more focus on this high need area in the United States, Cell-Ed is submitting an application to the adult literacy XPRIZE. Cell-Ed had the great fortune of being on the visioneering committee for the prize and continues to believe we need more players in the space to provide mobile learning pathways for all.
 
 To conclude, LA is our home and we can think of no better way to serve our region than by bridging access divides to education and wellbeing. In LA County, over one-third of adults still lack “prose literacy” and cannot read a newspaper. Over 54% speak English less than well and only 5% have access to classes. Compounding the problem, adult school funding has been slashed by more than half in our county. Cell-Ed is one way to reach households with the critical language and life skills they demand. LA2050, we urge you to help us reach these households on their terms.

 We will identify 20 small companies with long-term employees (3 years or more) who seek to own the company they work for. The overwhelming majority of minority workers in LA’s private sector work for small businesses, (companies with 500 or fewer employees). Yet, less than 33% of these companies are owned by people of color; our proposal seeks to address this issue by encouraging entrepreneurship in the workplace of these smaller companies
 Proceeds from our 2050 grant would be used to create a transition plan for employee groups that includes a business valuation for negotiating the business sale, a training plan that identifies employee skills needed and drafting of a ‘letter of intent’ to preclude the business from being sold during a period of due diligence.
  
 We will enroll interested employees in entrepreneurial training designed to prepare them for eventual company ownership. By including blue collar workers in the ‘class’ of potential business owners and buyers, our proposal seeks to address income inequality and expand the economic horizons of employees it touches
  
 By extending ownership opportunities to employees who would otherwise not have the chance to own their own company, our initiative seeks to make LA a more inclusive environment that encourages entrepreneurship, risk taking and creativity. The overwhelming majority of blue collar, manufacturing jobs are in the areas of LA with the highest concentration of low-income residents and people of color yet the ownership of these companies is still predominantly white and live outside of the communities where the companies are located. . “Seventy five percent of all small business is owned by folks over 55 years of age and every 7 seconds a Boomer is turning 65 and will do so for the next 15 years.” Transitioning these companies to existing management/employees groups will revitalize the business, realign their outlook with more contemporary racial and ethnic realities and extend the company’s useful life. 
 
 Recycling an existing manufacturing company with its years of goodwill, customer base and trade credit in-tack is easier than starting a new one. Bank financing is more readily available due to a track record of earnings or past history that demonstrates repayment ability. Long-term employees understand their business.","The largest single barrier employee groups face who seek to take-over a company is the widely held myth that workers can’t be entrepreneurs and that self-governance isn’t possible in the workplace. We hope to demonstrate that this myth is false. We have already successfully transferred the ownership of 7 LA County companies to employee groups - and all have been successful.
  
 A 2050 grant would increase our ability to transition more companies by giving us the resources needed to prepare employees for the transfer: time needed to learn new skills and arrange the financing needed to purchase a company. In much the same way that ‘first time homeowner’ programs have been successful teaching new buyers financial literacy, we hope to prepare potential business owners for the challenges of owning their own company – one whose operations they fully understand but whose finances are frequently a mystery to them.","We evaluate our work in the method that traditional economic development practitioners do; by the numbers. We will use the following matrix:
 
 ·Jobs saved and/or created
 · Number of entrepreneurial candidates readied to take over a company
 ·Number of companies identified as potential transfer of ownership candidates
 ·Total dollar amount of investment
 ·Total number of loans secured and dollar amount
 ·Total number of businesses where ownership transferred to employees.
  
 We will also have a qualitative evaluation of our work with focus group studies using our partners as members. These qualitative focus groups will examine such questions as to our effectiveness in following areas: leads generated, quality of referral we make to them for trainees and impact in their service area of our work transitioning companies.","Our approach to minority business development is unique. We’re looking at entrepreneurship from within an existing company with an eye toward preserving and recycling an existing company as opposed to starting up a new one.
 
 We work with the long-term employee (3 years or more) in a private company where the owner is seeking to retire or transition the ownership of the firm. Most existing entrepreneurial training programs are geared to those seeking to start-up a new venture. Our efforts are geared to preserving and recycling LA County’s existing small business infrastructure. We believe that start-ups are much riskier than taking over the reins of an existing company with an established track record where the employees are familiar with the operations and business cycle.
 
 There’s a tsunami of small business ‘baby boomer’ owners seeking to exit their companies in the next 10 years for retirement. National statistics show than less than 1/3 of smaller companies’ transition to the next generation in a family. Many of these businesses will be sold to interests outside of California, larger companies seeking to consolidate their operations or competitors seeking to broaden their market. This results in loss of the company identity and jobs. Our program will prepare a very different group of owners to take the place of these owners; ones that are younger, more diverse and with a different perspective on running the company. Our overall goal is to make LA a more diverse and inclusive place for business ownership.
 
 The existing network of business brokers, banks and lawyers involved in transitioning small companies are transaction-ally oriented focused on preserving ‘assets only’. We’re transitioning whole companies and the jobs within. We seek to breathe new life into existing companies; not strip them of their character or separate them from their workforce. Currently, seasoned employees in management of these companies are forced to exit when a company is sold to a new owner. Our initiative seeks to expand their capacity, broaden their horizons and create new wealth by having them own the company they work for. It’s a ‘bottom’s up’ approach to economic development as opposed to a traditional approach of increasing investment opportunities for those who currently own assets.","Our partners in this project will be the collection of non-bank lenders, workforce centers and economic development providers who make up the fabric of LA’s economic development infrastructure. This includes Pacific Coast Regional Corporation (PCR), the Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) and TELACU (lenders). The LA City and County network of Rapid Response Teams that are part of the Workforce Center Program funded by the U.S. Department of Labor will help us identify companies undergoing a transition of ownership. Many of the groups that offer loans also offer entrepreneurial training along with other community based groups such as Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation, West Angeles Community Development Center and the network of Small Business Development Centers sponsored by the Small Business Administration.","The successful transfer of ownership of all 20 companies will cost and estimated $ 5,100,000 over the next 3 years. Almost 75% of the cost is the equity needed for each transaction. The remaining 25% of the costs, approximately $ 900,000 are the transaction costs, which average $ 45,000 per company. 
 
 We estimate that it will take 36 months to transfer all 20 companies because each group of potential buyers will have a varying state of readiness to become owners. Each group will need a personalized transfer program, tailored to their level of business acumen. It is likely that one third of the groups identified by our outreach will need a year or more of training to be ready to take over the business. Given the time it takes to get the buyers ready and the businesses’ varying state of readiness to transfer ownership, it is important that we cast a wide net and create a pipeline of businesses.
 
 Within 12 months of the grant award, Concerned Capital estimates that we will transfer the ownership for seven businesses. Concerned Capital will evaluate and prioritize the businesses in the pipeline for readiness to transfer. An estimated $1,400,000 to successfully complete the transfer of ownership of 7 of these companies. 
 
 $140,000 will be needed to hire a Certified Public Accountant to create independent valuation reports, and generate year-end financial reports and projections for the target businesses.
 
 $160,000 will be needed to provide legal assistance for both sides, including due diligence for warranties and representations of the seller, write purchase contracts, ensure the legality of the transfer pursuant to state law, and make sure the new officers are appointed correctly and set up the new corporation with the state.","Our LA2050 grant proceeds will provide matching grants to employees seeking to develop entrepreneurial skills. We look to identify 100 employees within existing companies that seek to develop the skills needed to own and run their companies. Our training budget allows for $200 per employee with $100 matching funds coming from the interested employee. Our total budget for non-profit partners we will use for training is $20,000. Our training partners charge for their training services and each offer a different range of services – bookkeeping, management, advertising, marketing and sales. We will be selecting which training program is needed once we’re able to access the employee group skill set. 
 
 To help us identify companies with interested employees we will develop a social media campaign that uses video testimonials distributed over LinkedIn and Instagram. Our goal is to reach out to younger workers in companies where the owner is seeking to retire or transition the ownership of the company. We have successfully transitioned 7 companies over the life of Concerned Capital and we seek to document these first. We estimate a budget need of $25,000 for this work.
 
 The balance of our budget will be used to support activity connected with transition of ownership work which includes; development of an offer letter with employees and the owner, valuations and securing financing from non –traditional lenders. Development of projections, business plans and organizational development will be part of this activity.","We plan to scale this project first to the Southern California Region and then to the rest of the Country. Our work has been identified by the Los Angeles providers of Workforce Services as a Best Practice for saving Jobs. We plan to launch this initiative with these providers as a ‘demonstration program’ and based on our local success share it with the Federal Government. 
 
 Our plan is to start by deploying this program in 25 Major US Cities through the Department of Labor.
 
 We also hope to introduce this concept to Economic Development Professionals in cities throughout California and eventually the rest of the nation. Every city has an Office of Economic Development who we will reach through social media as we currently do on Linkedin.
 
 The National Association of Workforce Providers is a trade group with 14,300 members nationwide that we routinely share innovations with. This group will also scale the program nationally. 
 
 We feel that the idea of long term employees buying the company they work for will be seen as a solution to the issue of income inequality and preserving manufacturing jobs. These issues have already been highlighted in our nation's upcoming presidential election."

This will improve their lives dramatically and free up all the associated resources. We have a solution to finding space for these communities and we have a training scheme to encourage the acquisition of skills that provide ongoing employment. Chronic homelessness impacts many lives and by providing solutions (housing, jobs, local clinics and community care) we can begin the task of eradicating this tragedy and making LA a model of how all cities should be. Experience has shown us that we can provide individual, high quality homes whose construction can be paid for by a weekly rent of $100 - $140.","Planning and zoning issues are a major challenge. However we have already 'passed' the plan check part of the building process. The major obstacle is land acquisition. If no land is donated (either privately or publicly) we have a solution as to where we can build these show homes and start a community. It is fairly radical, although entirely feasible - the technology hasn't been available until now to utilize this space. We envisage that finding a donor for the show homes will not be difficult however.","We will evaluate occupancy rates, energy usage and generally evaluate demand. We know from similar construction in different parts of the world and different States that demand is very high.","There are other companies doing similar work but not with the intent of eliminating a specific inner city housing problem. Our buildings are different to every other kind of construction and provide unparalleled safety, energy efficiency and longevity.",We will be encouraging major construction companies to contribute equipment and materials with the aim of providing the maximum number of homes. The design will be done gratis and it is intended that a lot of the work be done on a volunteer basis.

Over 20,000 people from all over the County of Los Angeles attend each monthly Art Walk. We intend to put the focus on civic involvement, by sponsoring viewing sites for political debates, candidates forums, politically-themed art exhibits at downtown galleries, voters registration tables and screenings of films concerning the political process. We will develop a mural tour focusing on politically-themed art. We will develop a tour for children and their families focusing on the political process and encouraging children to care about elections.
 
 Every vote makes a difference, and we want our followers to appreciate how important their participation in the political process is. We will encourage our followers to lead their own ""get out the vote"" drives, and will add links to voters registration and information sites on our Facebook page and website.","We anticipate that political speech will foster discourse, which is sometimes impolite. Our goal is to encourage civilized discussion and debate, and to encourage speech across the spectrum of political views. Our volunteers will be attentive to the quality of the discussion, and will intervene when and if discourse becomes too heated or disruptive.","We will post a reward for bringing ""I Voted"" stickers to the Art Walk immediately after the election. This may be an artist-designed small poster or large postcard relating to the theme of the event - My Vote Matters. We will tally the number of stickers we receive (or the number of posters we give out). We will ask each person who submits a sticker whether they have voted in an election (or mid-year election) in the past.","Yes. Political parties and the League of Women voters conduct vote drives. Our proposal is unique in that it ties voting with a social event (the Art Walk) and special programming designed around the theme - My Vote Matters. Art Walk gathers a large constituency of people interested in the arts and culture. Many of our followers are young and are have not yet become involved in the political process. We can involve our followers through a number of activities not traditionally associated with voters registration drives - visiting galleries, viewing murals, attending film series, etc. These participants will be rewarded for returning after the election and showing that they voted. We will be using culture and social interaction to encourage participation in the political process. We will also encourage families with children to participate in a ""kinder walk"" of politically-themed murals to introduce children to the idea of participating in the political system.","We would ask the Regent Theater (and if not the Regent, another local theater) to program films relating to the political process and live broadcasts of major debates as well as live debates on local issues of interest.

 Further, with Mayor Eric Garcetti’s directive to source 50% of Los Angeles’ water locally by 2035, significant policy and behavioral change is urgently needed to conserve existing resources and bridge the gap before much-needed infrastructure projects are implemented – projects that may take many years to be developed.
 
 Changing Los Angeles’ dependence on costly, unsustainable imported water is crucial to our future, but how can we do this if most of us don’t understand the problem? The vast majority of residents have no idea where their water comes from, let alone how to do a better job of managing it.
 
 Heal the Bay is set to launch the Dropping Knowledge Project – Building a Water-Literate L.A. – an inclusive, multi-language water conservation initiative designed to enhance citizens’ understanding of Los Angeles’ dependency on water imports and simple, affordable water conservation strategies that can be implemented at their home and businesses.
 
 Furthermore, we will help Los Angelenos understand that the water challenge is winnable through smart planning and prudent investment in multi-benefit infrastructure projects that do a better job of using and re-using the water we ALREADY have.
 
 We have boiled down our educational mantra to the three key easily memorable directives familiar from the world of packaged goods:
 
 Reduce – We need to cut back on the amount of water we use as a region.
 
 Reuse – We need to capture, cleanse and reuse water, such as urban runoff and stormwater.
 
 Recycle – We need to recharge our aquifers with treated wastewater from Hyperion instead of dumping it useless into the sea.
 
 Heal the Bay will train new and existing organization volunteers, so they can present the curriculum to groups via Heal the Bay’s existing network of partners (e.g. schools, businesses, faith-based and civic organizations), in addition to reaching all 95 neighborhood councils that represent a diverse cross-section of the city of Los Angeles.
 
 Heal the Bay will also leverage its impact and messaging via social media.","Los Angeles is made up of a diverse and dense collection of cities and communities. 
 
 Reaching a significant population will be a challenge. 
 
 This is why it is so important to use a team of trained volunteers from all over the region to make the greatest impact. 
 
 To leverage the Dropping Knowledge Project, Heal the Bay will work with PAVA - Pacific American Volunteer Association and Pacoima Beautiful to help overcome language and cultural barriers in its messaging. 
 
 Both groups will assist Heal the Bay in developing its messaging, materials and presentations. 
 
 As the program grows, Heal the Bay will conduct outreach to partner organizations that reach other ethnic communities in the Greater L.A. region – be it the Japanese-speaking communities in Torrance or Armenian-speaking neighborhoods in Glendale.","Heal the Bay will evaluate the success of the Dropping Knowledge Project using the following metrics:
 
 Between January 1, 2016-January 31, 2016: Partner contracts will be signed. Heal the Bay will finalize its multi-language curriculum, with input from scientists and partner organizations. 
 
 
 Between February 1, 2016 and February 28, 2016: Heal the Bay will introduce 35 individuals to its water literacy curriculum through its existing Speakers Bureau training program.
 
 Between February 1, 2016 and February 28, 2016: Heal the Bay will train volunteers/community partners.
 
 Between February 2016 and November 2016: Staff and trained volunteers will provide 150 water-literacy presentations for 8,000 individuals, with a special focus on 95 L.A. neighborhood councils.
 
 Dropping Knowledge Project materials will also be disseminated at 75 community festivals across the city reaching 10,000 people. 
 
 Heal the Bay will evaluate feedback offered through pre- and post tests.","There are currently no other Los Angeles-based organizations providing free, multi-language water literacy programs for the general public. The Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Metropolitan Water District provide content online, but the information is tailored for K-12th grade audiences, not adults.
 
 What makes Heal the Bay’s approach different is its capacity to meet and educate citizens ‘where they are’ including schools, churches, civic (Rotary and Kiwanis) businesses and community centers and then reinforcing messaging via social media and directing citizens to other useful online resources.
 
 As a trusted member of the community for 30 years, Heal the Bay has developed a reputation for integrity and trust. Heal the Bay has a long track record of blending science-based advocacy and hands-on community action. 
 
 Heal the Bay's awareness and favorability ratings are the highest among local nonprofits.
 
 People know us, like us, and listen to what we have to say.
 
 We let people be active agents in healing the bay, rather than just passive donors. We have developed a unique voice that is fun and participatory – as demonstrated by our booming social media networks. So we think that we can engage people in direct, funny and powerful ways that traditional nonprofits and bureaucratic “play it safe” government agencies can’t

In fact, Heal the Bay’s first major victory was the citizen-driven initiative that resulted in critical infrastructure upgrades at the Hyperion Treatment Plant in 1987– still to this day, one of most important environmental wins to benefit the Santa Monica Bay. 
 
 Heal the Bay is confident that its proposed Dropping Knowledge Project will make a great impact due in large part to the organization’s capacity to develop meaningful, call-to-action messaging, broad network of contacts in the Greater Los Angeles area and reputation as a reliable educational resource for the greater community– the project also has the potential of being successfully replicated in other large urban cities with water security issues and ethnically diverse populations."

DUBLAB experimented with a storefront studio during our Spring 2015 Proton Drive Fundraiser and saw tremendous results.
 
 Dublab has a long history of making LA the best place to connect. Over the years, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles. Dublab has curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and, for four years, we presented a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Music Center, Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT, cicLAvia, and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles. DUBLAB also serves as a creative incubator for musicians in Los Angeles to develop their sonic experimentations in both live performance settings and studio­ based radio broadcasts.

DUBLAB plans to leverage its many partnerships within the Los Angeles community to find such a space. Additionally, the generous funding provided through the LA2050 Initiative will provide ample latitude in finding the correct space for this project.","DUBLAB's Open Studio Initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics: 
 
 PUBLIC FEEDBACK:
  
 To evaluate the response from the public, an e-mail survey will be conducted with participants at the end of the project’s first year. Feedback given by the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from studio staff. 
 
 MEDIA RESPONSE: 
 
 Press received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion. Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event will be considered a success. We will also take into account the depth of social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number of followers gained. 
 
 Staff Review:
 
 The staff will conduct a review at the end of each month of operation to evaluate the studio's success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of engagement. At the end of the first year of operation we will determine if the quality of the project successfully fulfilled the initiative's goals.","DUBLAB is a unique organization in Los Angeles.

 Create the “ECS Serves LA” program, which will: 
 
 *Place every ECS high school senior - 120 teens – in semester-long internships across LA. Inspired by the Phillip Brooks House at Harvard College, this service referral system will formally connect five-person peer groups of ECS students with local, hands-on opportunities to make a positive impact. 
 Conducted in subject areas related to their senior thesis, these internships will give youth the chance to contribute to LA’s civic infrastructure while deepening their understanding of social issues. 
 
 *Be comprised of 15-20 not-for-profit and community agencies. To form the network, ECS will formalize agreements with its existing partners such as Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation, and various LA River organizations. ECS will also reach out to new groups. 
 
 *Serve as a reference model within the LA region: ECS Serves LA will help change the way other LA high schools approach service learning. By assembling a vast network of the “who’s who” of the LA social service sector, ECS will make the model replicable across disciplines, will be available to show other LA educators and activists how to implement this program at their schools. 
 
 To Change The Way Teachers Learn, ECS Will: 
 
 *Expand its Green Ambassadors Institute (GAI), a learning lab offering professional development for both teachers and organizations looking to implement hands-on sustainable education. By expanding, GAI, ECS will: 
 
 * Share its five (5) Best Practices with twice as many teachers throughout the LA region. ECHS employs the following instructional strategies and best practices, which we believe are unique and successfully develop changemakers in both students and educators: Small Learning Communities, Interdisciplinary Curriculum & Authentic Assessment, Relevant and Engaging Instruction, Environmental & Experiential Learning and Collaboration with Partners. 
 
 *Expand the Number of Educators GAI Works With Through Increased Outreach and Marketing:
 ECS will reach out to new networks of teachers, will also create one (1) new GAI marketing video, and will create take-home impact tools to support teachers post-workshop (such as PDFs, resources, and guides)","ECS anticipates that network response might pose a challenge. Both programs are predicated on target audience response. Accordingly, these external relationships with potential host organizations and local teachers are absolutely essential. 
 
 To overcome this challenge, ECS will bring on staff specifically designated to seek and out and target new networks beyond ECS’ current reach. We will reach out to colleagues in different areas and disciplines beyond the environmental movement, and welcome the Goldhirsch Foundation’s recommendations towards that end.","ECS will evaluate its work according to the following metrics:
 
 *How many students were placed in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 120 students)
 *How many organizations participated in the 2016-2017 ECS Serves LA internship program (goal = 15-20)
 *How many more teachers attended the 2016-2017 GAI professional development program (goal = 70 from at least 30 schools) 
 *How many GAI workshops we were able to offer (goal = 4) 
 
 The evaluation will be overseen by ECS’ Director of Curriculum & Instruction Amy Frame and Service Learning Coordinator Sammy Lyon. Frame and Lyon will be supported by a new Outreach Associate that ECS will hire for this LA2050 project. This Associate will help expand ECS’ reach by connecting it to more organizations and educators in the LA area. At the end of the academic year, the Associate will follow-up and gather impact data for Frame and Lyon’s tracking purposes.","While there are many organizations in LA doing activist work and education, ECS occupies a unique space at the intersection of those two sectors. Its unique model produces stellar educational outcomes – with 98% of its graduates qualifying for and 96% admitted to a four-year university – and also earns awards. Environmental Charter High School was chosen as one of three national finalists in President Obama’s Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, and ECS was ranked in the top 3% of U.S. public high schools by U.S. News & World Report. We also received an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) award for working to protect public health and the environment, and ECHS was in the first round of schools to be given the Department of Education’s inaugural Green Ribbon Award in environmental and sustainability education. 
 
 
 The ECS network approach is also unique because of who its programs serve. ECS students are the demographic future of Los Angeles: more than 90% of its students are Latino, Asian, or African-American, and most are the first in their families to go to college. Research shows that California schools that serve more than 90% Latino, African American, and American Indian students are almost 10 times more likely than majority white and Asian schools to experience severe shortages of qualified teachers (California Educational Opportunity Report, 2011). 
 
 Through GAI, teachers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to allow them to become effective classroom facilitators as their students become empowered to be sustainable community leaders. And through ECS Serves LA, students gain valuable work experience as businesses gain the input of diverse young voices from across LA.","ECS has worked with dozens of partners, from community-based nonprofits to local businesses to schools and municipal entities.

Our students are primarily youth of color who have been pushed out of traditional schools through suspensions, expulsions and/or lock-ups, and are left with few options to complete their degree. Social justice organizing is integrated into our curriculum in order to equip youth with the skills necessary to work towards more just education systems.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,ALL,"FREE LA High School is a safe haven and alternative education program in South Los Angeles that supports system-involved youth, ages 16-24, in obtaining high school diplomas. The students we serve are primarily youth of color who are often unable to complete their high school education in a traditional school because they face systemic and everyday challenges such as increasing violence in their communities, unstable living conditions, and scarce resources after returning home from lock-up. 
 
 FREE LA’s core academic program includes English, Pre-Algebra and Algebra, and Life and Earth Science. At the heart of the program, however, is training and direct, experiential learning in social justice organizing and movement building. FREE LA’s teachers provide standards-based instruction on systems of oppression and strategies for dismantling racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism/homophobia, adultism, and religious fundamentalism. For example, Economics is taught through units on slavery/human trafficking, globalization, food justice and immigration. In addition, students are often provided opportunities to apply lessons learned in the classroom into real-life situations, including field trips to give testimony to elected officials about experiences in solitary confinement in detention.
 
 FREE LA High School also prepares youth for college. Staff organizes annual field trips to local community colleges, state universities and vocational schools in order to provide students with a vision of post-secondary education. Former students who have transitioned to college or vocational school regularly visit FREE LA classrooms to talk about their experiences and mentor current students. AmeriCorps VISTA volunteers assist students with college applications and submitting financial aid forms. College support begins when youth enroll in FREE LA High School and continues into the youth’s post-secondary career.
 
 We envision a 2050 in which all youth have the same resources, opportunities and experiences in our city’s education system. In the immediate future, we will continue to provide system-involved youth with the support they need to graduate from high school prepared for college and the training necessary to engage in social justice organizing, empowering them to challenge oppressive education and juvenile justice systems.","YJC members, including FREE LA students, experience extreme levels of trauma – homicide, suicide (successful and attempts), assaults, substance abuse and police conflict – on a daily basis. In the last four years alone, the YJC has buried 51 youth and young adults that were victims of street or police violence. 
 
 Like other poor youth and youth of color, our students experience extreme levels of violence, discrimination and disrespect. Because the YJC does not have the resources to adequately support youth and their families through these challenges, we regularly watch youth and families endure extreme suffering with little relief. 
  
 As a response, we have integrated transformative justice into all our programs in an effort to ensure that the YJC does not rely on police and courts to maintain peace. This also allows us to reduce our families and communities reliance on suppression (law enforcement, courts, etc.) to solve conflicts and reduce violence in our homes and streets.","The Youth Justice Coalition will evaluate the impact of FREE LA High School on the youth it serves by tracking quantitative and qualitative metrics. Quantitative metrics include enrollment, average daily attendance, classroom grades and standardized test scores. Qualitative metrics include levels of confidence and motivation to attend school and obtain a high school diploma. Metrics will be collected through record keeping as well as student interviews and classroom observations. As a result of attending FREE LA High School, system-impacted youth will graduate from high school prepared for college, engage in direct action organizing and social change work, and have decreased interaction with police, incarceration time and arrests.","While there are many charter schools across Los Angeles County serving disadvantaged youth, FREE LA is the only one specifically serving system-impacted youth. YJC’s definition of system-impacted youth is a young person who has been suspended, expelled or pushed out of traditional school, has personal experience with incarceration and/or probation, and/or has a family member is involved in the justice system. 
 
 FREE LA High School is unique in that our program develops the leadership skills of its youth through workshops and trainings in transformative justice, social justice organizing within a school culture that is safe, healing, and supportive of system-involved youth. FREE LA students have developed a series of RESPECT Trainings, which are focused on implementing transformative justice policies and practices in schools and school districts. FREE LA students not only facilitate these trainings, but also adapt their curriculum and content based on feedback received. To date, Free LA youth have facilitated trainings to over 3,500 youth and adults on strategies for reducing violence, harm and conflict mediation, and healing from trauma.","FREE LA High School operates under the supervision of our partner YouthBuild Charter School, which was founded to provide quality, continuation education to out-of-school youth - including those attending Job Corps and Conservation Corps – while meeting all state requirements for completion of state standards and passing the statewide (CAHSEE) high school exit exam. 
 
 In undertaking campaign work, YJC and FREE LA High School partners with various local, statewide and national advocacy groups. On the local level, the YJC is a member of Black Lives Matter, local Probation Camp Redesign Work Group, Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, LA Dignity in Schools Campaign, Brothers, Sons Selves and Coalition to End Sheriffs Violence. On the state level, the YJC is an active member of Youth Fair Sentencing Work Group, Californians United for a Responsible Budget, Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, Statewide Work Group to Fix School Discipline and California Alliance for Youth and Community Justice.

5102141,Effective Drought Solutions,2015091,,,"Strategically reintroduce native beaver populations back into the dwindling watersheds around LA County, using modern techniques where beaver are ""trained"" to engineer dams where we want them to, yet leave our infrastructure intact. Beavers are proven to be highly effective at mitigating drought, flash floods, and erosion. As the first major metropolitan area to embrace this cost-effective solution, we would be ensuring a lasting, positive impact on the economy and ecology of our whole region.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,ALL,"“Any city smarter than a beaver can keep a beaver!”
 -martinezbeavers.org motto
 
 Drought. It’s punishing, relentless, and impacts our daily lives in countless ways. From raging wildfires, to soil erosion, and rapidly increasing temperatures, the drought has had a tremendous impact on California. To support tourism, agriculture, and an ever-growing population, the state that’s ranked as the world’s eighth-largest economy must begin to explore efficient and cost-effective solutions to this long-term problem. 
 
 Fortunately, there is a tried and true solution to persistent drought; reintroduction of native beaver species. Similar programs have been successfully implemented everywhere from arctic Canada to the deserts of Nevada, and even in parts of California, one of the states hit hardest by drought. However, being the first major metropolitan area to embrace beaver reintroduction only reinforces Los Angeles’ reputation as progressive and forward-thinking. It is a simple solution that is also cost-effective, has a quick implementation-to-results timetable, and has innumerable benefits to our environment as well as creating positive change in the lives of millions of Angelenos.
 
 I propose that we reintroduce the North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) to key areas where we need to control drought, flash floods, and further loss of fish and wildlife habitat. Modern techniques will guide these ultimate hydro-engineers to do the work for us. By reintroducing this keystone species on our terms, we can lock our aquatic ecosystem into a healthy equilibrium. From this foundation we have the ability to create community gardens, more urban natural space, food forests, and increase important wildlife habitat.
 
 Additional advantages of reintroducing beavers into their natural habitat include: intensive water filtration, drought “savings accounts” created by the deep, topographically varied ponds, and naturally rich soil that is dispersed throughout regions where beaver reside. Fish and wildlife populations flourish wherever there are beaver, not only because of the additional water they store in their environment, but because they share their dens with a host of other beneficial creatures.
 
 Beavers are capable of turning a tiny trickle into a massive pond. We need more clean surface water, they can provide it. They are malleable to our agenda if one applies the techniques that encourage them to build where you want them to.","Funding. Despite this being an incredibly cost-effective solution to our region's largest problem, there is always caution around changing the way we do things.
 
 To overcome this obstacle, I plan on working with the California Fish and Wildlife Department as well as those of other states that have experience with beaver reintroduction. 
 
 After the first beaver family is introduced, the recovery of the landscape is demonstrated, and the rapid retention of clean water occurs, the project will speak for itself. From that point on it will be much easier to tout the benefits of replenished beaver habitats, as well as confirm the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of this solution.","Weekly, monthly and yearly data will be collected on water volume, soil health, and wildlife populations at each beaver site. As soon as one colony is established and proven effective, another one can be introduced, tracked, and monitored. This method will ensure that beaver are being kept in areas that will be most beneficial to humans.","There are many, many organizations doing similar work across Canada and the US! What is unique about my proposal is that we would be the first major metropolitan area to use beaver behavior to our advantage.
 
 Short-Term Beaver Reintroduction Specific to LA County:
 -Reintroduce 1-2 beaver families on National Forest and/or privately owned land
 -Monitor and record the results for the first 12 months
 -Evaluate the data 12 months post-reintroduction and see if more beaver families can be added
 -Seek round two of funding
 -Move from pilot project to permanent commitment to reintegrating beaver county-wide
 
 Long-Term Beaver Reintroduction Specific to LA County:
 -Work with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and local landowners to implement a county-wide beaver reintroduction program specifically designed to improve surface water storage and soil quality
 -Beaver proof key drainages and culverts across the county
 -Place beavers in key areas of the San Gabriel Mountains to begin retaining water in the mountains as insurance against low snow years 
 -Place beavers in key areas around rural and suburban LA county, where flood control, fish & wildlife restoration, and water “savings accounts” are needed
 -Monitor beaver behavior on a weekly, monthly and yearly schedule, keeping close records of their activity and water metrics
 -Following a 2-year trial period, ascertain whether they would be beneficially introduced into more urban waterways such as the LA river
 -Use the newly created beaver habitats as educational tools for school kids and adults all across LA County
 -After 2-5 years, establish permanent food forests alongside established beaver habitats
 -Use the beavers as a means to upcycle unwanted tree debris. This technique helps them stay put where we want them and also prevents them from felling the trees we want to keep

For the pilot project, it would be quite doable to start with 1 employee, a few volunteers and a willing landowner or government agency.","$100,000 is sufficient to get the pilot program off the ground for the first year or two on a small scale, but to permanently implement the program county-wide it will take more. Additional funding can initially come from landowners in need of water, but ideally City Planners and the Department of Fish and Wildlife will jump on board to help take the project to a larger scale as it becomes evident that this is our best hope for drought recovery.","$10,000 for acquiring the first beaver family for reintroduction.
 $10,000 for acquiring basic beaver ""training"" tools (these also protect the surrounding infrastructure) and baffles (pipes that regulate water levels in beaver ponds).
 $10,000 for consulting fees. Bring in a beaver expert to teach and implement proper procedure.
 $20,000 to hire a temporary, part-time employee to track the results of the first beaver family, measure and monitor water volume, take soil samples, etc. 
 $50,000 buffer to continue with the project while further funding and approval are in the works.","Success will be scaled one beaver family at a time. Each family creates its own micro-oasis. Careful planning for where we place our first beaver colony is important, but as we familiarize ourselves with their engineering abilities, their territory could be allowed to expand exponentially. As The Southland grows more comfortable with the idea of a symbiotic relationship with beaver, the positive ripple effects will be greater and greater."
5102092,El Basurero,2015057,,,"MyLA311 (http://lacity.org/myla-311/myla-311-service-request) is an excellent service that allows city residents who know about it get bulky items and illegally dumped furniture picked up for free. The problem is, not enough people know about it or take the few seconds involved to logon and enter a request for service. Basurero would be a sustained door to door and social media campaign to publicize MyLA311 and get neighborhoods like Koreatown, Mid City, South LA and East LA swept clean.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Learn,"No one need live in a city littered with discarded TVs and electronics, white goods, couches, mattresses, cars and car parts. The piles of trash and illegally or improperly dumped items that are allowed to accumulate on the streets and in empty lots in Koreatown, Mid City, South LA and East LA are perpetuating the inequity that has too long characterized life in the balkanized city of LA. Recent research and investigative reporting has confirmed what everyone who lives in these neighborhoods knows. The collection of trash is highly uneven. Poorer parts of LA are disproportionately dumped on and trash, including hazardous materials, is routinely left to leak on the street for days, weeks, months and sometimes years, ultimately leaking into the soil and groundwater. Discarded paint, products containing lead, mercury, motor oil and other hazardous materials are left in the open on our streets where young, unsuspecting children play. No one should be exposed to these hazards, let alone the youngest and most vulnerable. The City of LA has a program for collecting bulky items, hazardous materials and illegally dumped items, but not enough residents are aware of the program or have access to the smartphone app or internet to request a pickup. Landlords routinely ignore the state of the sidewalks outside their property or on empty lots. The reliance on vigilant, informed residents to report all of the dumping that takes place is foolhardy. 
 
 This program would make MyLA 311 a household name in all Spanish, Korean, English and the other languages spoken in the target area. It would achieve widespread action on the part of the city that periodic coverage of the inequity in trash collection has failed to achieve. 
 
 The program would also develop policies to ensure that it is easy for landlords to do their job as well, in ensuring safe living conditions on their properties as well as on the sidewalk out front and in the empty lot next door.
 
 The result will be a cleaner, safer LA where children and adults are not exposed to the hazards created by the current reality.","Someone on the City Council or at Sanitation/Street Services will surely cry foul. They will argue that they are already working overtime to keep up with the demand. They will bemoan the added cost to the City (taxpayer) of picking up all this trash and hazardous material that most other cities are be committed to clearing off the streets as soon as possible.
 
 Basurero's strategy will be to kill the opposition with kindness. The Basurero corps will document the program's efforts with before and after photos, with praise for those who embrace the effort. Landlord of the Week, Sanitation Worker of the Week, Councilmember of the Week, Koreatown Basurero of the Week... There will be contests to see who calls in/logs on with the most requests. We will show that an informed public makes the most engaged citizenry and will will show results that residents can see and experience. We will sweep clean LA's most densely settled neighborhoods and ensure that they stay clean through vigilance.","Basurero Corps will document the program's efficacy with before and after photos, counts of requests filed with MyLA 311. The City is already capturing this data so we will work with the Council Districts and with MyLA 311 to analyse the data and assess the impact of the program.","As noted above, the City's MyLA 311 program is available to those with the knowhow to access the system and request an illegal dumping pickup. The problem is with the multilingual/multicultural outreach. The end of the month, when tenants move, is the worst, but it never gets any better in Koreatown, Mid City and South LA. 
 
 What is unique about Basurero is we are improving in a grassroots way an existing city service and technology. Equally importantly, we are empowering residents to put their citizenry and government to work. They learn how to request a pickup, that pickup gets scheduled, and within a week, the illegally dumped refrigerator or television has been removed. The hazard to their child is gone. The sidewalk is clear again. 
 
 Basurero is community engagement and empowerment at its most basic level, with the added, measurable impact of creating a cleaner streets.
 
 While there are no other organizations involved in this effort in the targeted communities, Basurero envisions considerable collaboration with groups like LACC, Koreatown Youth & Community Center (KYCC), TRUST South LA and other community initiatives. Ultimately, Basurero anticipates integrating the program with street tree planting by KYCC, with whom we have worked in the past, and other community beautification efforts. 
 
 The Councilmembers are also other natural partners. They get our calls and emails about the illegal dumping. They will be enlisted as critical allies in the program.","Basurero envisions working closely with LACC or a similar partner. To keep costs down, the hope is to secure alternative funding for the time commitment of the partners. High school and college students who earn credit for canvassing their neighborhoods are another approach that might be employed.","Initiatially, Basurero does not anticipate the pilot costing in excess of $100,000. This will cover administration, partnership development, technology including smart phones for the canvassers conducting outreach in a neighborhood.
 
 Given the growing disgust among the public, in the business community and in the philanthropic community over the appearance of our streets and neighborhoods, Basurero anticipates that the piot will appeal to donors impressed with the vision, the quantifiable results and the way the program empowers and engages LA residents. This is a modest but overdue program that does sets forth fairly simple objectives: 1) Clean up the streets, sidewalks and empty lots of Central, South and East LA; 2) enlist and engage residents as citizen activists advocating for their own communities and families; 3) Improve the delivery of an existing city service; and 4) Improve public health outcomes for children and others by removing from the environment, mercury, lead and other hazardous materials illegally dumped in our communities.","Project Director: $65,000/year
 Technology - smartphones, tablets, ISPs: $8,000
 Social Media - technologists: $12,000
 Partners - outreach stipends: $15,000","Angelenos, especially those who live in Koreatown, Mid-City, South LA and East LA are tired of being dumped on. Residents of these areas are ready to see their city provide the sanitation (and other) services it promised them. Landlords and business owners, electeds and the philanthropic community is also tired of hearing the excuses about the shabby state of our streets and sidewalks. When Basurero launches and shows success, there will be calls for its expansion. Success will begat success, as residents of other underserved parts of the city see the results being achieved by citizen activists in Mid-City and elsewhere. They will call for their own illegal dumping to be picked up.
 
 Basurero is already talking to potential funders, anticipating interest in scaling the program. Good models may be largely volunteer efforts including Big Sunday and CicLAvia, which grew from more modest initiatives to what they are today. Basurero plans to engage with Big Sunday, CicLAvia and others about the lessons they learned in scaling their vision and programs. We are realistic about our scalability."
5102212,El Dorado Park Project (Stormwater Arroyo),2015140,,,"El Dorado Park project will create a 1-acre innovative multiple-benefit park adjacent to Pacoima Wash in a disadvantaged community. The park will feature recreational, educational, and water-quality improvement features such as landscaped fitness trails, free-play meadow, picnic and community gathering spaces, education stations, and stormwater treatment basins which will be attractive, educational, sustainable, and will clean Pacoima Wash by capturing, treating polluted stormwater and trash.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Pacoima Neighborhood,0CreatePlay0,"This project will create a new recreational feature by transforming a currently vacant and deteriorated site into a unique, aesthetically pleasing, multiple-benefit natural park by improving the landscaping, and adding supporting amenities such as an amphitheater, nature trails, adventure play area, interpretive elements to help educate users about natural resources, picnic area with free Wi-Fi, and art plaza for community gathering and interacting. Additionally, the park will feature all California-native drought-tolerant landscaping which will provide habitat for local wildlife, provide shade, generate oxygen, and remove pollutants from the air thus helping to reduce the adverse impacts of global warming. The park will also feature a solar panel collector which will provide power for the energy needs of the park and will educate the public about the benefit of energy savings.
 This project will also add much needed park space to Los Angeles as there is currently a critical lack of parks to play in. The project’s close proximity of the nearby public and private schools and apartments will ensure that a good majority both youth and adults are able to access and play in the park. The park will feature areas designated for play that are made of natural components such as plants, logs, boulders, hills and trees. These components represent a unique “wild environment” in a way that provides the feeling of being in nature but is safe and manageable to young visitors. A few man-made components have been carefully integrated to support creative play, encourage confident exploration and help children develop a lasting affinity for the natural world. Seniors and other family members will similarly benefit from this open space through genuine recreational opportunities via walking trails, gathering areas for social and cultural interaction, new learning experiences, and a greatly improved environmental experience. 
 There has been much research on the subject of the benefits of outdoor play. Playing outside helps children to understand and respect nature, the environment and the interdependence of humans, animals, plants, and lifecycles. While play is crucial for a child’s development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. The new Franklin-Ivar Park will provide the Los Angeles community with a safe outdoor space for more play.","One of the reoccurring concerns expressed by the community both during the outreach phase of the project and in subsequent community meetings is safety. This concern has been addressed in the design of the park by including secure perimeter fencing and by strategically planting so that site lines are open and allow for visibility. This will continue to be addressed once the park opens with periodic patrols by agency staff, camera surveillance, coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department and Caltrans, and through the active use of the space by the public. The most effective deterrent to ‘bad use’ is positive and increased use by families, seniors, and youth, and the park has been designed to maximize participation by these user groups.","As the project is located in a park-poor community, the mere existence of the park will be a gauge of its success as it will add new recreational space for families, children and the community to play in. We expect that is park will be heavily used, given the involvement and anticipation displayed to-date by the local residents. The success of the project will be evaluated, in part, by the frequency of its use and future stewardship. A Friends of Franklin-Ivar Park group may be established to ensure continued stewardship for the space, engage the community, encourage park use and activate the space. The picnic and plaza area was designed to accommodate a farmer’s market allowing neighbors the opportunity to interact and purchase fresh local produce. The children’s play area will be utilized by kids from all economic groups fostering friendships and improving their physical health. MRCA may conduct surveys to evaluate and summarize the anticipated use vs. the actual use of the park.","There are other organizations who have complementary goals in the Los Angeles area, including California State Parks and City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. 
 
 The MRCA’s approach is unique because we incorporate park elements that provide more than just recreation: Our goal is to bring ‘nature’ to the City by developing natural parks that serve to also provide habitat for local wildlife, educate the public, and provide much needed public access to open space. Additionally, we approach projects in a manner that involves the surrounding community in a valuable way. The local community participated in the planning process for this park during an in-depth community outreach process through 12 community meetings to ensure that residents felt comfortable and engaged. As a result, the final design is ultimately considered to be the ‘community’s vision’. Two of the key points that informed the design direction were: Residents wanted a natural children’s play area; and natural open space areas were important to nearly every participant. 
 
 Lastly, the long term operation and maintenance of the project will be the responsibility of MRCA. The MRCA is a local public agency who’s mission is to protect land and provide public access to natural lands in southern California. Since its inception, the MRCA has designed, planned and constructed scores of natural park projects throughout Los Angeles. The MRCA’s successful operation of our existing parks is compelling proof that the long-term success of the Franklin-Ivar Park is ensured. The agency has an established reputation for high-quality maintenance and maintains a positive presence in both our urban parks and natural open spaces.","The MRCA has partnered with a number of entities in the planning of this project including: 
 • Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) – As the land-owner, the Conservancy is our largest partner. Due to MRCA’s expertise in urban park projects, the Conservancy has delegated long-term responsibility to plan, develop, and maintain the property.
 • City Councilmembers David Ryu and Mitch O-Farrell – Although the park is technically in Councilmember Ryu’s district, it sits on the border of the two Council Districts. MRCA met with Councilmen O’Farrell, who is supportive and committed to help in any way and has offered to facilitate, if needed, to make the project move forward in a timely manner. Councilman O’Farrell has a history of being helpful with the creation of small pocket parks as well as larger endeavors like the greening of the Los Angeles River. Councilman Ryu took office in July 2015 and is also supportive of the project.
 • Hollywood/Los Angeles Beautification Team (HLABT) – Their mission is “To improve the quality of life in Los Angeles by empowering citizens to change their environments for the better.” HLABT has been a project partner since the inception of this project and has facilitated with public meeting during the conceptual design phase.

 If awarded, the full $100,000 would be allocated to the MRCA to implement the park project. Our agency and community partners would continue to participate in the planning, design and implementation of the project.","The total estimated cost to construct the Franklin-Ivar Park project is $1.6 million. We currently have $1.2 million in funding from California State Parks Proposition 84 grant and California Natural Resource Agency through an Urban Greening grant. The requested $100,000 will help MRCA to supplement the funding shortfall and allow us to construct the park sooner.","1. Project Management / Construction Management : $20,000 
 2. Site Preparation : $10,000 
 3. Adventure Play Area : $35,000 
 4. Fencing/Gate(s): $25,000 
 5. Electrical: $10,000","The obvious measure of the park’s success will be its frequent use by the public and the simple fact that this currently vacant and derelict site will become an active place for people to play. There is currently a large desire and need to transform this, and other vacant lots, throughout Los Angeles into spaces that the public can utilize and enjoy. The mere creation and use of this park will be a major success and a step in the right direction to clean and activate Los Angeles. 
 New urban parks of similar size were recently constructed by the MRCA and serve other park-poor neighborhoods. Constant outreach through social media such as Facebook, emails and person to person contact has allowed us to reach a wider scale of people and further the success of our public programing, resulting in higher number of attendance. The same will be done with Franklin/Ivar Park. 
 Additionally, as trees and other vegetation are proven to sequester carbon and improve our air quality, the park’s tree canopy and shrubs will almost immediately clean the air. Furthermore, air quality will be improved and greenhouse gasses will be reduced due to the park’s easy access via walking and bicycling, its close proximity to public transit, and permanent designation as open-space."

Our cultural landscape will be stunted if we don’t help the artists among this population to express themselves. Tierra will identify people who are artistically gifted, and empower them to build careers, increasing employment in creative industries such as animation, ceramics, and commercial art.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Tierra’s Fine Arts program combines individualized support with professional instruction to empower individuals, with significant disabilities, to build careers in the arts. The program integrates a variety of art forms to allow participants to identify and cultivate their passion, while speaking to different audiences. Almost 140 people each day explore their interest and talents in the arts, through painting, drawing, and ceramics, at Tierra’s First Street Gallery Art Center and Sunland Studio Arts. Tierra has enabled over 10% of the people we serve (70 of 660) to become professional artists.
 
 Artists with moderate to severe developmental disabilities develop their artistic skills, create art, and display and sell their work throughout Los Angeles County. Tierra Fine Arts is a year-round program that provides individualized instruction each weekday. The program is comprised of:
 
 (1) Professional Arts Career Training
 Tierra provides professional training, by instructors who support artists in building their arts résumé, and guide development of career skills such as writing artist statements, creating exhibition themes, and selecting and installing art for exhibitions. These skills prepare the artists to market their complete, fully-developed résumés.
 
 Each participant develops a personalized plan for career goals, independent transportation, and social skills. This plan might include developing their career skills by volunteering at non-profit organizations. Artists, in the Tierra Fine Arts program, teach arts and serve vulnerable populations at non-profits including: Joslyn Senior Center, daCenter for the Arts, and Emerson Village Assisted Living.
 
 (2) Art Creation
 Artists are invited to create and submit work for consideration in exhibitions. For a recent exhibition, called “The Open Road”, Tierra artist Joe Zaldivar created and submitted an illustration of Hamer Toyota’s lobby. This piece was featured in the announcement, at the artist reception held at Hamer, and has become a permanent piece of art in the dealer’s lobby since March.
 
 (3) Promotion and Exhibition
 Tierra staff members identify exhibitions that build artists résumés and share work. Tierra builds relationships with galleries and local businesses to increase the reach of the artwork at 6 or more exhibitions each year. As a result, people in Los Angeles have an example of how they, and their family or friends with disabilities, can overcome challenges to achieve their goals.","Only 4%, of the 838,842 California working-age adults with developmental disabilities, are employed in the community (Federal Register 2014, U.S. Census Bureau 2013). The other 96% face segregated employment options in “sheltered workshops” that often pay a piece rate resulting in less than minimum wage income or no option at all.
 
 Each day, Tierra serves 660 adults with developmental disabilities (740 each year), while creating scalable models that will allow our community to support these individuals as they pursue employment.
 
 Seventy Tierra artists currently sell and exhibit their work, but many more have the artistic skill to transition into careers. Limited communication skills and social networks prevent them from advocating for themselves and marketing their work. Tierra’s staff identify opportunities for artists, in our programs, to build their resumes by participating in juried competitions, and installations at local businesses, and exhibitions.","Tierra Fine Arts will engage new audiences in the painting, sculptures, and illustrations produced by artists with developmental disabilities. As a result, Tierra will achieve the following objectives:
 
 Objective 1 – Tierra will continue to maintain full capacity of quality art programs, helping 140 people each day (260 each week) improve their skills in the fine arts, work ethic, productivity, workplace conduct, safety skills, communication skills, mobility skills, and money skills.
 
 Objective 2 – Seventy (70) artists, with moderate to severe developmental disabilities, will build their professional arts resume by publicly exhibiting their work.
 
 Objective 3 –Tierra will increase exhibition attendance by 10-15%. The sales, exhibitions, and attendance will be monitored and compared to prior years’, to determine if changes made in that year positively or negatively impacted the community’s involvement.","In Tierra Fine Arts, adults with even the most severe developmental disabilities explore their interest in the arts and pursue professional arts careers. Tierra supports them in lending their creative voices to the entire community by creating and displaying art, sharing their talents by volunteering at nonprofit organizations, and taking part in coalitions and collaborations that challenge the city’s current level of accessibility and recognition for adults with developmental disabilities.
 
 Every person, who takes part in Tierra’s Sunland campus-based programs, has the opportunity to take part in fine arts classes. No matter what level of interest an individual has, a professional arts instructor guides them in exploring fine arts, identifying their interests, and pursuing their career and life goals.
 
 Rather than isolating and segregating people, Tierra’s arts studios are a launching point for the person’s community involvement. Through partnerships with over 110 non-profit organizations, participants explore a wide variety of arts careers, while serving others by teaching art classes to seniors and children, and providing docent services at art galleries.
 
 Tierra’s Director of Fine Arts creates opportunities, for adult with developmental disabilities to expand their arts careers. By participating in arts coalitions, such as Arts for L.A., Art Beyond Sight, and Claremont Museum of Art, and sitting on the board of Los Angeles Art Association and The Pederson Museum, Tierra has a voice in the direction of the arts throughout Los Angeles County.
 
 These efforts have resulted in Tierra artists exhibiting and showing their work in 52 locations across the United States and five other countries. Tierra Fine Arts has presented at Los Angeles-based arts exhibitions that draw international audiences, including an exclusive art exhibition at the 2015 Special Olympics World Games. This exhibition was held over 10 days at USC and UCLA, creating opportunities for people from over 165 countries to experience the art and build inclusion and acceptance for artists with disabilities.
 
 These outcomes aren’t ancillary to our organization; Rather, they are the natural results of Tierra’s efforts to live out our vision to empower people with disabilities to fulfill their potential and desire to become productive citizens who are accepted and valued for the contributions they make to the economic, civic, and cultural vitality of our community.","Tierra’s staff and existing partners identify potential collaborators and make recommendations to the Director of Fine Arts and Exhibition Coordinator. Partnerships are formalized using a Memorandum of Understanding, and no financial commitment is incurred by either partner.
 
 Since the program’s inception in the late 1980s, Tierra has built partnerships with 52 galleries, collectors, companies, and universities that have resulted in Tierra artists’ work being exhibited in 257 shows at venues such as The Special Olympics World Games at USC and UCLA, The Good Luck Gallery Los Angeles, The Smithsonian Institution and Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., Valley Presbyterian Hospital, L.A. City Hall, and internationally in Belgium, Germany, Japan, and Canada.
 
 Once identified, Tierra Fine Arts leaders evaluate potential partners using the following criteria:
 
 1. Alignment with Tierra’s values
 2. Ability to enhance individuals’ professional arts careers
 3. Ability to expand the types, locations, and audiences of exhibitions in which Tierra participates
 
 Core partners include: Claremont Graduate University, which provides exhibition opportunities; J. Paul Getty Foundation, which has provided undergraduate interns to Tierra Fine Arts each year for the past 21 years; and Claremont Chamber of Commerce, which will provide advertising for exhibitions, and will connect Tierra’s Director of Fine Arts to opportunities to speak, about the program, to community organizations. This partnership will also provide marketing consultation with SCORE, a nonprofit association that uses a mentorship-based model to grow small businesses.","The Tierra Fine Arts program operates on a $840,324 budget. This includes personnel costs for one Director of Arts, an Exhibition Coordinator, a Gallery Manager and a Ceramics Instructor, and one Direct Support Professional for every four artists. Operating expenses include program supplies, art supplies and framing, rent for Tierra’s First Street Gallery Art Center in Claremont, and management/overhead costs.
 
 The State of California contracts with Tierra del Sol Foundation to provide basic custodial care to adults with developmental disabilities. This contract totals $582,453 in the current fiscal year. However, none of these funds are available for the art program; Tierra relies on fundraising to sustain and grow this program. 
 
 Tierra must raise $257,871 to fill the gap, keep Tierra Fine Arts, and ensure ongoing professional instruction and exhibition opportunities for the adults we serve. This is 30% of Tierra’s fiscal year 2016 fundraising budget. Tierra designates this large percentage, of our fundraising, to this program because of the value it provides to the participants’ careers, and to the community’s appreciation of the art and the artists. Tierra’s Circle of Inspiration plays a key role in sustaining the organization’s annual source of funding income from individuals. The newly-launched campaign establishes a formal platform to cultivate, steward and recognize longtime and new contributors who have the ability to support Tierra via a minimum annual gift of $1,000. These individuals are also encouraged to serve as ambassadors, advocate Tierra’s mission and renew or increase their commitment on an annual basis. Circle of Inspiration members’ loyalty and commitment is celebrated with a special recognition event at yearend, as well as continued opportunities for members to engage in educational, fundraising, and advocacy events.","With $100,000 support from The Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 Grants Challenge, Tierra will create opportunities for adults with developmental disabilities to build their careers in the arts, and share their artwork throughout Los Angeles County. This includes:
 
 o $20,750 for art supplies and framing (50% of $41,500 annual cost)
 o $1,673 for transportation and supplies for volunteer employment training (20% of $8,340 annual cost)
 o $4,440 for marketing the 8 exhibitions hosted on Tierra’s campuses (100% of annual printing, publishing, and mailing cost)
 o $21,759 for Tierra’s art studio and gallery space in Sunland and Claremont (25% of $87,036 annual cost)
 o $51,378 for salary and benefits for 4 full-time employees: Director of Arts, Exhibition Coordinator, Gallery Manager, and Ceramics Instructor (25% of $205,513 annual cost)","Tierra’s programs are designed to allow for scalability of Tierra Fine Arts. Over 200 students, at Tierra’s 7-acre job training campus, pursue arts as a way of increasing their communication skills, building strength in their hands, exploring the arts as a potential career path, and enjoying a part of life that transportation and communication challenges often exclude them from. Each year, 16 people transition from site-based programming at Tierra’ Sunland job-training campus, to fully community-based life. As these individuals move into careers, college, and full-time volunteerism in the community, they take their new arts skills and appreciation with them, while allowing new students to begin their own arts experience.
 
 Tierra creates new opportunities for artists by leveraging the success of Tierra artists, and involving guest artists and curators, such as Gallerist Daniel Weinberg and David Pagel, art critic for the Los Angeles Times. As artists’ careers take off, their work becomes sought-after by collectors and galleries, which contact Tierra directly to request installations and exhibitions. Tierra’s Exhibition Coordinator expands the impact of these opportunities by enabling new artists to exhibit their work alongside the career artist, thereby building their resume and launching their own professional arts career.
 
 Helen Rae is one artist who has built a career through Tierra’s Fine Arts program. At the age of 70, and despite her inability to use verbal communication, Helen has inspired a dedicated following of art lovers who seek out and collect her work.
 
 At Tierra’s First Street Gallery Art Center, Helen creates paintings and drawings that are animated and full of character. Helen began creating art at Tierra in 1990, at the age of 52. Since then, her work has been shown at GoodLuck Gallery, ACME Gallery Los Angeles, and Claremont Graduate University. She earned an Award of Recognition from the Artists Beyond Disabilities Exhibition in Pasadena. Helen’s work has been featured across the country and internationally, including shows in New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Belgium and Scotland, and a traveling exhibit viewed in Okinawa, Fukuka, and Miyazaki Japan.
 
 Helen’s career has resulted in hundreds of other artists’ success. As people discover her art, they realize that disability does not have to be a barrier to creativity, and open themselves up to appreciating art from other artists in Tierra’s program."

To effectively do so, we will offer more professional learning opportunities, conduct outreach to secure more volunteers, mentors and staff, as well as organize events for the community that showcase the work of our members. Our purpose for doing this is to ensure that more and more of our young artists find success.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,ALL,"By expanding, PIECES will be filling the void there is of available places for young people to create. For young artists 18-25 years of age, who outgrow after-school programs, graduate or that drop out of school, a place like PIECES plays a vital role in whether or not they aspire to do greater things or settle for less in life. 
 
 Our experience with this overlooked age group has been that since they are no longer considered children and therefore lose various types of support, they can truly lose track of their dreams while trying to figure out how to live in their new roles as adults.
 
 Through the community at PIECES, we all learn that we have the power to succeed in what we work hard for, if we continuously are open to learning, and that we have a stronger voice when we unite our creative minds. 
 
 PIECES creates opportunities, a support system, a community – what many of our current members call their second home. We would like to bring what we have to all of the young artists living in the West Los Angeles area and to those who travel from across L.A. County to participate in our programs. We will be providing enriching and fulfilling opportunities with a mission of sparking creativity, success, innovation and union.",Our main obstacle has always been that not everyone in our community sees the importance of the arts and in offering opportunities in the arts.

5102163,Ending Wage Theft in Los Angeles,2015106,,,"We seek to increase the resilience of low wage workers and their industries in LA by improving the enforcement of basic labor protections. We will design and pilot a wage theft prevention tool to help predict when and where wage theft occurs, so that City officials may wisely allocate resources to protect workers’ wages, and responsible employers from unfair competition. We will also produce industry case studies, to identify and learn from employers who create quality employment.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,None,"Each week, 30% of Angelenos in low-wage industries make less than minimum wage. 80% who work overtime aren’t paid for it; another 80% work through breaks. All told, wage theft siphons $26.2 million weekly from low-wage workers and the economy. Lost tax revenue robs the state of some $153 million annually, and local government of some $16 million.
 
 The cost of wage theft isn’t just economic; it affects the health and well-being of communities. Each year, workers lose 12.5%--$2,070--from take-home pay of $16,500. This perpetuates poor housing and food insecurity. It exacerbates existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, ulcers, and depression. Workers struggle for additional hours to make up for lost wages, diminishing time for children, education, or self-care. 
 
 Enforcement is impossible in a climate of fear, yet Angelenos attempting to enforce their rights face a 50% chance of retaliation. This climate of lawlessness gives a competitive advantage to businesses who cheat. Employers who want to do the right thing can’t compete.
 
 LA City and County voted to address economic inequality and stagnant wages by increasing the minimum wage. But without enforcement, as minimum wages increase, so will wage theft. New wage enforcement offices will need tools to handle the volume of violations when the new wage takes effect.
 
 We propose a prototype to help identify the characteristics of 1) businesses in high-wage-theft industries that beat the odds to create good, healthy workplaces and 2) those who commit the most egregious violations. The prototype can inform policy to assist good actors and more effectively target businesses who bring our City down. It offers refined understanding of when and where wage theft occurs--as well as when and where businesses rise above. In a climate where retaliation is endemic, this promises a more inclusive process, helping identify violations where plaintiffs are afraid to come forward. We will share our prototype and convene conversations with the city, data scientists, and community groups. We will conduct case studies in high-risk industries to identify distinguishing factors between “high road” employers and employers with exceeding numbers of wage-theft complaints. 
 
 This partnership between KIWA; UCLA Labor Center; and Princeton researchers including the CEO of Department of Better Technology unites decades of on-the ground knowledge with employment policy expertise and data-driven analytical capacity.","Access to data is the primary obstacle. Historical wage theft data is needed to train the model to predict the type of firms likely to stand out as the best and worst actors. These data must be paired with other firm-level characteristics such as tax-record information, density of surrounding competitors, and industry characteristics. 
 
 Regarding both qualitative and quantitative data, KIWA has 23 years assisting workers to submit wage claims, a deep knowledge of conditions in low-income communities, and strong ties to other community organizations. In California, wage-theft complaints have been handled by the State Labor Commission. At KIWA, we have strong ties with the Commissioner. She has shared data with us in the past and we are confident that she will be enthusiastic about this project and work with us on these requests. This grant will dedicate resources to enable systematic data collection and bring on board competent, comprehensive data and policy analysis.","Our evaluation will answer three questions:
 
 Does this save time?
 
 Does this accurately predict violators and high road employers? 
 
 Does this help community based organizations and wage enforcement agencies allocate resources more effectively?
 
 These questions will be measured through qualitative interviews with wage enforcement officials and community organizations, as well as with quantitative results from the prediction model.","Fifteen organizations comprise the steering committee of the Los Angeles Coalition against Wage Theft, who are dedicated to building awareness of basic labor rights addressing wage and hour violations in specific communities. For example, the Garment Worker Center resolves claims for garment workers; the Restaurant Opportunity Center for restaurant workers; and the CLEAN CarWash Campaign for carwash workers.
 
 However, this is the first known attempt (in Los Angeles or elsewhere) to use machine learning and new data science techniques to help predict when and where wage theft occurs.","For this project, KIWA is partnering with the UCLA Labor Center as well as researchers and technologists from Princeton University. UCLA Labor Labor is a leading research and education center for worker justice, and will support the identification of existing data and relevant researcher. Tia Koonse, Legal and Policy Researcher Manager, and Veronica Wilson, Partnerships Director, will lead this effort the Labor Center.

The deliberation and voting process democratically distills the many thousands of ideas into a small, high-quality, representative set that can easily be considered by a neighborhood or city council. We make democratic participation scalable. 
 
 For this project we will build on the platform we have developed that asks “What are the most important issues in the US” (see the 1 minute demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-P5xMvOZ0Y). The platform allows discussions to be structured, and the depth and headings of the structure can be configured. LA’s Great Streets Project needs this kind of application, and we would also work with city and neighborhood council members to put other specific meeting topics with broad appeal.
 Neighborhood Councils will be able to increase their participation, effectively, because people will be able to engage at the time of their convenience, using the device that they are comfortable with. It will be effective because online participation also fairly distills the contributions in to a small, high-quality, and representative set that can be reviewed by the neighborhood council during their meetings.
 
 The project will enhance government responsiveness because Residents of LA will be able to get together and find their most important issues, uncover the underlying problems, and create the solutions that unite them and make their support visible to their government in terms that are most meaningful to it – the number of registered voters for and against it. By seeing majority support on issues, elected representative can more confidently act on them. 
 
 Voting rates by race will increase because we measure and market to achieve to balanced participation compared to census data and we drive people to register to vote. When there is an under represented segment we will increase market spending in that demographic in order to achieve balance. When people register online they are asked to register to vote or to verify their registration. (but it is not required. It is also possible for Citizens of other countries whom are residents of LA to register and participate).
 
 This is a new form of civic social media that people will be able to connect through.","The major barrier is the one government is facing at all levels – participation. We will reach out to participants through both online and in-person programs. Online we will reach out to people through social media using targeted ads based on LA location and demographic. In person we will also reach out to people through talks and demonstrations at neighborhood council meetings, and other events.","We will evaluate our work by the growth in participation, and the demographic balance of the participants, as well as the number of solutions reached with overwhelming support. These statistics will be available through a web page on the platform and will be updated in real-time.","Neighborhoods.com is a platform for engaging geographically local communities.

We propose a three-pronged collaborative approach to addressing chronic absence and truancy: 1) changes in school attendance practices; 2) home visitation; and 3) parent engagement and leadership opportunities for our enrolled families.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"Para Los Niños works to close the achievement gap for children living in poverty through an educational approach that integrates high quality academics, family and mental health supports, and community engagement and leadership opportunities for parents. 
 
 The majority of children we serve are being raised by single mothers, grandparents or other family members, with an average annual income of $15-20K. The average truancy rate across our two charter schools located in the Skid Row community is 25%. 75% of the children are English language learners; over 90% are Hispanic, 9% are African American, and the rest consist of other ethnic minorities. 14% of families are linguistically isolated, nearly double the rate for Los Angeles County, and 50% of parents of our charter school students report middle school as their highest educational level attained.
 
 School attendance practices will provide parents access to school information on attendance behavior policies, and access to positive reinforcement for attendance behavior efforts. School policies will include: orientations for parents on school policies and expectations for student attendance and on-time arrival; contact people for parents to connect with when there are challenges getting their children to school; student rewards for improved attendance; and use of data to identify who is at risk of poor attendance and then working with the family to develop attendance plans for children missing too much school. 
 
 Home visitation will provide schools access to additional information about a child’s home environment that may be impacting attendance. Home visitation will also help families access a trusted and supportive relationship with a school faculty member. 
 
 Parent engagement opportunities will provide parents access to more accessible and practical spaces to get involved in their children’s education and to learn about the importance of regular school attendance and how truancy can negatively impact their children long-term. Parent leaders will be trained to facilitate peer groups where families share resources and information with one another.
 
 Expected outcomes for this proposed project will include not only reduced truancy rates at two charter schools in Skid Row, but also the development of a parent leadership network throughout East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles and other areas of Los Angeles where many of our families reside or access resources.","Our students’ parents have great difficulty accessing critically important services and experience stressors including unemployment; child abuse and neglect; domestic and community violence; food and housing instability; and isolation—all contributing to limited opportunities for academic and life success. We are committed to addressing those opportunity gaps, driven by the belief that education can be the vehicle for reducing inequality and promoting social mobility and justice, and challenging the notion that a child’s destiny is determined by his/her zip code. Given the already busy and stressful lives many of our families live, it is incumbent upon us to create a climate around attendance behaviors marked by school and home partnership, recognition that a child is part of a whole ecosystem that includes a family and community, and an attendance approach that is based on the principle of access.","1) School staff and school parents will complete a short questionnaire to inform development of an inventory of root causes of truancy at our schools.
 2) We will create action plans collaboratively with school and parent leaders to develop strategies that respond to the identified causes. 
 3) Parents and school staff will fill out satisfaction questionnaires at the end of the school year, with questions focused on their respective experiences with rolling out and collaborating on the school truancy policies.
 4) Parents who receive home visitation will receive pre and post assessments around a series of areas related to family stability, supports from others, and senses of efficacy as parents. 
 5) Parents in the engagement and leadership groups will complete pre- and post- surveys designed to measure knowledge, attitudinal, and behavioral growth around factors contributing to student truancy. 
 6) Compare baseline truancy rates with rates after one year of implementing this program.","Schools across Los Angeles are supporting families to reduce truancy and improve attendance.

Almost all of these students will be the first in their family to graduate from college, and most come from families that are living at or below the federal poverty level. Funding from LA2050 will help make college a reality for these students, and support our efforts to make college an expectation for all students across LA.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Roosevelt High School; Boyle Heights,Learn,"i.am College Track Boyle Heights is a collaboration between College Track and the i.am.angel foundation. College Track is a national nonprofit that empowers students from low-income communities to reach their dreams of a college degree. Our 10-year program removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree by providing them with comprehensive academic support, leadership training, financial and college advising, and scholarships. will.i.am created the i.am.angel foundation to TRANS4M lives through education, inspiration and opportunity, especially in his hometown of Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles. Boyle Heights is a predominantly low-income, working class, immigrant community that is rich in culture and potential, but struggling with a lack of resources and opportunities. 
 
 i.am College Track is a comprehensive program that provides social and academic support to over 260 Boyle Heights students from Roosevelt High School each year. 98% of students will be the first in their families to apply to college, and 94% come from low-income families that are living at or below the federal poverty level. College Track removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree through a four-part model, which includes Academic Affairs supports through tutoring, academic workshops and SAT and ACT prep; Student Life opportunities to explore workshops that cultivate students’ creativity, passions, leadership and socio-emotional skills; College Completion advisory workshops and scholarship guidance; and College Success mentoring, academic and emotional support during college. Each student spends approximately 5 hours per week at our center, receiving support in math and English, attending a college advisory course and participating in a student life activity.
 
 College Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. College Track also provides significant financial aid to our college students, as most of our students would not be able to afford college without it. In addition to training students to write and apply for scholarships, we provide both merit-based and need-based financial aid. With our Bank Book for Success, students can earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals. These funds provide both upfront funding and help minimize student loan debt","College Track’s primary challenge is ensuring that our students’ families are invested in and supportive of their children’s goals. Many of our first-generation college students not only lack the financial resources to attend college, but may also embark upon a lonely path, lacking family members to provide guidance. Some families dislike the idea of children independently living on a college campus. Alternatively, while parents may be supportive of their children, the student may suffer with guilt about their own aspirations, which may involve leaving home and abandoning their responsibilities.
 
 To address this concern, i.am College Track Boyle Heights developed a family engagement program to complement students’ regular academic and social programming. Our family engagement strategies ensure that families are aware of the path to and through college, are given timely information, and have opportunities to understand what their students will experience at college or university.","College Track measures our effectiveness by the number of students served and the impact we have in helping them earn a college degree. Nationally, College Track aims to reach 75% four-year high school program retention, 100% high school graduation, 90% college matriculation, and a 60% college graduation rate.
 
 As the i.am College Track Boyle Heights center prepares to graduate its first cohort of students, the site’s 2015-16 school year goals include enrolling 260 students (4 cohorts), 85% student attendance rate, 90% one-year retention rate, 85% of 12th graders Cal State (CSU) eligible (2.5+ GPA), 70% of 12th graders University of California (UC) eligible (3.0+ GPA), 100% of 12th graders graduate high school, and 85% of 12th graders matriculate into a four-year college. We measure progress on an ongoing basis against various indicators, including enrollment, retention, attendance, college readiness and academic performance, in order to adjust our strategies accordingly.","There are various nonprofit organizations across LA and the nation that provide either college access supports to help students get into college, or supports once the students have gotten into college. Unlike these organizations, College Track recruits students during the summer before 9th grade and works continuously with them for up to 10 years through both high school and college graduation. After analyzing college completion results for our first three graduating classes, we realized that focusing our support on ensuring that students were eligible to attend college did not guarantee that they would graduate from college. Our students are primarily first generation college students, and as such, face a great deal of hardship in completing their degrees. 
 
 College Track is more than a college prep program, and our reach goes well beyond that of a tutoring center. The College Track model supports students through every crucial step of high school and college through college graduation. College Track becomes part of a student’s life, a member of their community, and an academic lifeline when students need one the most. Our program model is structured to prepare students for the academic and social demands of college. A student who completes our four-year high school program receives support equivalent to one additional year of high school. College Track supports the whole student and offers student life activities that are similar to what students in more affluent schools enjoy. Some examples include robotics and computer science workshops, guitar and photography lessons, and a Chinese Alive course where student have an opportunity to learn Mandarin and travel to China.
 
 Unlike similar organizations, once College Track helps students get into college, we continue to support them through college graduation. As our 12th grade students prepare to graduate high school, we provide financial planning workshops, academic advising and social/emotional support because getting into college is one thing, and being financially and emotionally ready for it is another. Our team is committed to doing whatever it takes to make sure our students graduate from college. We visit our students on campus, provide academic advising, connect students with on-campus resources, provide need- and merit-based scholarships, and host an annual student reunion.","College Track and the i.am.angel foundation are working together to support the students of i.am College Track Boyle Heights on their journey to college graduation. The full $100,000 award amount will go to fund scholarships for the 46 seniors graduating this June as part of the Class of 2016.
 
 As part of his commitment to philanthropy, will.i.am launched the i.am.angel foundation in 2009 to TRANS4M lives through education, inspiration and opportunity. The i.am.angel foundation administers charitable activities and programs targeted toward providing college scholarships, college preparation and opportunities in STEAM education (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics).
 
 i.am College Track Boyle Heights serves students from Roosevelt High School and Roosevelt Math, Science and Technology Magnet Academy, in collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. College Track collaborates with additional partner organizations, including 826LA and the Boys and Girls Club, to build a network of coordinated and complementary services, share best practices and professional development, and leverage joint resources. We also participate in the Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities collaborative to strategically benefit the local community.","i.am College Track currently has $150,000 budgeted for scholarships for our Class of 2016 graduating seniors. To raise the remaining $50,000 College Track and i.am.angel foundation staff will seek additional philanthropic dollars from local individuals, foundations and corporations. College Track and the i.am.angel foundation continually work to diversify funding sources and pursue new sources of revenue to support our scholarship program, core services and expansion efforts through grant writing and individual donor solicitation with the help of our Board of Directors and Los Angeles Local Advisory Board.","i.am College Track will use the $100,000 LA2050 prize to fund the scholarships awarded to our Class of 2016 graduating seniors. As noted above, College Track provides our students with both merit-based and need-based financial aid in order to help minimize student loan debt, which is one of the primary obstacles facing low-income students’ completion of college. Our Bank Book for Success offers students the opportunity to earn up to $5,600 in financial support from i.am College Track by meeting specific academic, community service and attendance goals.
 
 The full scholarship budget ($150,000) is based on 39 graduating seniors (85% college matriculation rate of full cohort) receiving an average Bank Book award of $3,845 per student. The LA2050 $100,000 grant will specifically support college scholarships for 26 i.am College Track Boyle Heights students.","Together, College Track and the i.am.angel foundation strive to turn Boyle Heights into a model for other communities around the country. College Track’s model for student success is based on over 18 years of operations in California and across the country. Historically, 93% of College Track 12th grade students have been accepted into four-year colleges. Furthermore, 84% of our 12th grade students are college eligible and 89% have matriculated into a four-year college. Our students are graduating from college at a rate that is 2.5 times the national average for low-income students. We are confident that applying our program model in Boyle Heights will bring the same success and long-term well being to the students of Roosevelt High School, and positive outcomes to the LA community overall. Building on the success of our Boyle Heights center, College Track recently launched its second LA site in Watts, and we plan to launch two additional LA-based sites in low-income neighborhoods over the next five years.
 
 College Track is in the process of defining our formal 10-year vision to scale our success to benefit a greater number of students. Our current plan involves creating deep partnerships with the schools, college and communities we serve to act as a thought partner around improving the broader college completion pipeline, both in LA and beyond. We will also take best practices from our work in Boyle Heights to further drive the seamless integration of our high school and college programming, minimizing the transition that can often serve as an obstacle in students’ quests to obtain a college degree. 
 
 College Track and the i.am.angel foundation have a history of partnering with other nonprofit and government organizations across Los Angeles, and we are happy to share the lessons learned from our work at the i.am College Track center in Boyle Heights to improve academic outcomes for students across LA and help ensure that every high school student in LA will graduate and be college and career ready by 2050."
5102263,Eureka Villa Permanent Adventure Playground and County Wide Pop-ups by SCV Adventure Play,2015176,,,"SCV Adventure Play is teaming up with Pop-up Adventure Play of the UK who will send an official play-worker to expand our pop-up adventure playgrounds into low income communities throughout LA County and help these areas cultivate their own play culture and spaces. It will also further develop ""Eureka Villa"" a permanent adventure playground in Northern LA County as a destination for young people to play on a beautiful 2 acre wild space and serve as a training ground for future play-workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Santa Clarita Valley,0CreatePlay0,"What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and materials where people can vibrantly engage in play that stretches their abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and encourages socialization. 
 
 Adventure Play is different than typical play spaces and activities because it is totally open-ended, player-led, multifaceted, believes in the concept of play-workers to support kids with or without parental supervision, and is adaptive to any culture and community. One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change. 
 
 We will help kids get out of the home and back into the parks and playgrounds by giving them time and materials to explore their areas and meet and connect with neighbors. It will help foster community by getting families and neighbors together creating safer neighborhoods for kids and adults alike. The more people playing outdoors the safer it is. 
 
 
 Our play-work education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all. Adventure play supports implementing and engaging neighborhoods to claim spaces to play in which may be otherwise unused. Many pop-up adventure playgrounds can restore empty or vacant lots into vibrant play spaces just by adding kids, loose parts and cardboard boxes.
 
 In addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County. Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.
 
 With the support of this grant, the start-up of Eureka Villa will give LA County claim to the 7th Adventure Playground in the United States. Eureka Villa will also be one of the only locations in the US to develop regular play-work training program which will produce individuals skilled in the psychology of play and further the reach of our mission to make open-ended play a priority in children's lives. At this point such programs exist primarily in Europe. Eureka Villa will serve as a hub for play-work training in the western hemisphere.","Offering Low or No-Cost Play Opportunities: We believe play is a human right. We do not think that money should decide who gets to join in on the fun, and we are committed to making sure poverty cannot dictate the well-being of our community. To appease this, we will need to operate on flow of income which may be little or infrequent and managed through a series of fundraisers, grant proposals, charity, and donations of time, materials, and other support. We will continue to build a strong community that can creatively navigate the ups and downs of capital, work with volunteers, and re-use loose parts as often as possible.
 
 Transportation to Eureka Villa: Because Val Verde is removed from the hustle and bustle it will be a big task to organize the transportation of non-locals to our site. To overcome this we hope to start locally and offer free visit days to all with hopes that as we grow we can begin solidifying field trip opportunities for schools throughout LA County.","Many of our goals will move forward at their own unique pace and we plan to implement a series of ""follow-ups"" to the areas we focus on increasing play space and camaraderie. Due to our focus of supporting communities to develop their own play spaces organically we want to make sure we are not just passing through but a constant source of support for the communities to sustain a safer and playable neighborhood.
 
 Bi-weekly team meetings: Both our pop-ups and Adventure Playground teams will meet to discuss observations on how to best solve problems and make changes to our sites both temporary and permanent. Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect with each other and the playground participants in a meaningful assessment of their play needs.","Locally, there is to our knowledge only one other Adventure Playground in the LA area, and that is in Huntington Beach. It is operated on a seasonal basis, and is a low-cost park. One major difference from Huntington park is that we are committed to being open as often as possible year round. We also want to focus on the needs of our specific neighborhood, and offer after school programs and workshops to allow for maximum usage of the space. Huntington Beach has little to no online presence or outreach either, whereas we plan to replicate more permanent spaces for play and long term local community relationships and educational opportunities. 
 
 Conversely, there are also portable organizations such as Side Street Projects (headquarters in Pasadena), who offer woodworking and other arts-related classes that can be done out of their bus in any neighborhood. They are also multi-generational, and we admire much of what they have done. Our pop-ups are less concerned with class-type learning and are more about providing a safe space where play is unrestricted and allowed to move at the speed and motivations of the participants. It is also a good time to illustrate to parents and others how free play can change the act of playing, by letting them focus on their projects and collaborations with no formal teaching. 
 
 Then there are other community arts organizations like our frequent collaborators The ArTree (headquarters in Valencia), an arts center that teaches classes on crafts, painting, sculpture, etc. to children. We differ from them because our method is not of a product-based instructional program, but totally focused on process, stress relief, and informal learning. The ArTree has a similar goal of inviting children to express themselves and offer inspiration through art but we take a different avenue to avoid pre-empting children of what they are expected to make and how they should make it. We also plan to offer our services not only to children but also adults in settings where they can be separate and or combined. With that though, our differences and common goals with the ArtTree allow our two groups to collaborate very fluidly, as they recognize the importance of play for children (and adults) and the creative problem solving encouraged through making and experimenting.","Our main collaborator with this project is Pop-up Adventure Play as part of their ""Play Ranger"" program where they send a qualified play-worker to impoverished areas to help bring play back into communities. Pop-up Adventure Play also has developed a play-work course which will be strongly utilized for our play-work training program. 
 
 We are also a founding member of the American Adventure Playground Association which is connecting Adventure Playgrounds across the US and have tremendous support and resources from those in various stages and types of adventure playgrounds, including permanent and traveling.
 
 We are already developing various workshops and collaborations with the nearest K-12 School, Santa Clarita Valley International. We have just finished our second year working with the City of Santa Clarita doing monthly pop-ups at their Thursdays on Main events. We have also held regular events at the local Earth Day Festivals, Day of the Child Festival put on by the College of the Canyons, and are continuously working with local arts organizations such as the ArtTree, SpotLight Arts, and Parenting groups. 
 
 We have collaborated with LA Parks and Recreation on the local level with great enthusiasm for future events. We also plan to identify operational areas to further expand possible partnering with the Parks and Recreation Department, Fish and Wildlife, Park Rangers, Child Life Agencies, and The Alliance for Childhood. 
 
 Funding from this grant will be used primarily for facilitation of our efforts and staffing. There will be cross-over with Pop-up Adventure Play for administering a play-work training program via staffing, communication, and on the ground development.","Our project cost will greatly depend on the travel, size and duration of our events. Our pop-up model has little material cost (mostly duct tape) making its main expense staff salary. On average, we expect our two full-time play-workers to work around 40 hours a week training, facilitating 2 to 3 pop-ups in LA County and 1 to 2 days of open play at Eureka Villa. This rounds out to about $4,000 per play-worker per month and $96,000.00 a year all together. 
 
 Other major costs include for the pop-ups; gas and a pop-up play trailer or vehicle, and insurance. These costs will range between $17,000 and $29,000. 
 
 Eureka Villa main costs include evaluating the 118 trees on the property, storage for the materials, portable toilet systems and a few supplemental materials which will need to be new and not used. We estimate it ranging between $5,000 and $17,000.
 
 We plan to focus much of the LA 2050 Grant funds toward non-salary expenses and those specific to pop-up outreach. For these expenses we are working with Pop-up Adventure Play for a bid on a Kellogg grant focusing on impoverished areas of the world. The Kellogg will also cover the costs of the assistant play-workers salary.","POP-UPS

5102217,Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles,2015142,,,"Every Kid in a Park Los Angeles will provide transportation grants to local partners to bring at least 8,000 fourth-grade students from Los Angeles to nearby national parks. The project will focus particularly on underserved students from federally designated Title I schools. The initiative also includes pre- and post-visit educational opportunities. Providing greater access to parks and connecting diverse youth to new recreational and educational opportunities are major program goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,Learn,"The Every Kid in a Park Initiative in Los Angeles will make LA the best place to play by providing at least 8,000 fourth graders in Los Angeles with meaningful experiences in local national parks. The project will serve local students, particularly from federally designated Title I schools. These students are often the least likely to have an opportunity to visit national parks and benefit from their recreational resources on their own. We believe transportation grants are one of the best ways to ensure that underserved kids and their families can enjoy recreational and educational activities in our national parks.","Our biggest challenge is likely to be the need for additional private philanthropic investment to ensure that transportation grants are available for all interested schools and youth service providers. Our strategy for overcoming this obstacle is to engage a broad base of investment from local foundations, individuals and corporations.","The National Park Service uses formative and summative evaluation in its education and youth programs, and will adaptively manage Every Kid in a Park as the initiative gets under way. Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles will benefit from broader evaluation conducted by the NPF and NPS. The evaluation strategy will:
 • Identify a baseline of our target audiences (youth, families, and teachers) perceptions, attitudes and use of NPS and its resources; those of overall park audiences; and those of the nation (looking at similar programs and resources for relevant lessons learned). 
 • Inform the decision-making processes of program managers and administrators regarding the development, implementation, adaptation and improvement of the program. 
 • Provide accountability and document the value and results of the program to stakeholders.","Organizations doing complementary work include the other federal agencies collaborating through the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR) that are part of the larger implementation of the Every Kid in a Park Initiative. In addition to the National Park Service, the other FICOR agencies are the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
 
 Every Kid in a Park focuses on fourth graders because NPS and other land and water agencies already have fourth-grade programming in place in many locations. Fourth graders have only one teacher at that age, making it easier for teachers to reach the group. Research shows that the earlier a young person connects with the outdoors, the better for their development long term, and children who interact with nature and natural areas before age 11 are more likely to have positive attitudes toward nature and the environment as adults. By targeting fourth graders one year at a time, we will ensure that every child in the U.S. has the opportunity to visit and enjoy their public lands and waters by the time he or she is 11 years old. Research also shows that spending time outdoors is incredibly important to a child’s development, and national parks serve as some of our nation’s most beautiful places for outdoor recreation. They also provide dynamic classrooms and centers for active learning for all ages.","NPS will build on existing partnerships with organizations across Los Angeles and Southern California. These include partnerships with NatureBridge, California State Parks, City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation, Groundwork Los Angeles, Weingart East Los Angeles YMCA, Santa Ynez Band of Chumash, LA Conservation Corps, UCLA and the U.S. Forest Service.
 
 NPS is in an ideal position to expand its collaboration with these groups and others, and their existing strong relationship with the U.S. Forest Service will be particularly helpful in getting young people from East Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.
 Specific local partners to receive transportation grants from the National Park Foundation will self identify through the grant application process.","The total project expenses are estimated at $350,000 in 2015-2016. The additional costs will be covered by additional fundraising from foundations, individual donors and corporations in Los Angeles. The National Park Foundation has secured $220,000 to date from foundations in Los Angeles.","Experience grants to parks and partners ($10/kid x 8,500kids) = $85,000
 
 Program evaluation and management: $15,000
 
 Total: $100,000","Every Kid in a Park in Los Angeles launches officially on Thursday, October 15. The first year of the initiative, coinciding generally with the 2015-2016 school year, will provide important lessons about what works best as we move into the second year of Every Kid in a Park during the 2016-2017 school year. We will scale up the initiative as we raise funds to provide additional transportation grants."
5102095,EWLA: Creating a network for exchange between artists and the public,2015060,,,"EWLA, a pilot program of ExchangeWorks, enables artists to pursue their vision and the public to contribute to the arts. EWLA connects artists to individuals and businesses through mutually beneficial exchanges, with an economic, environmental, personal and cultural impact.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"While working countywide, EWLA’s temporary event space will be located in LA’s Downtown Arts District, with the specific location to be determined",Create,"We value artistic vision and the way artists engage with the world. At this critical time when support for the arts is decreasing and the interest in art is increasing, EWLA builds alliances across disciplines and industries to create a strong support system for LA based artists and arts organizations. 
 
 LA is home to one of the largest concentrations of artists in the nation, many who urgently need specific resources to help them create and build sustainable careers. LA is also home to a growing community of art lovers and businesses with resources, such as professional services, equipment and materials, which are useful to artists. 
 
 EWLA catalyzes art through the following plan:
 
 RESEARCH: We will identify a minimum of 50 professional artists and 50 resource providers to be featured at our temporary space, with a larger group presented online. Participants include contemporary artists working in all media, who exhibit or perform in galleries and museums. Resource providers include individuals and businesses with a wide range of resources. EWLA recognizes the diversity of LA County and will include minorities, as well as ethnically and economically diverse participants. 
 
 OUTREACH: We will reach out to artists, resource providers and the art interested public through information sessions at local art and community centers, as well as through newsletters and social media. 
 
 EVENTS: EWLA will host a series of in-person exchange events at our temporary space in LA’s Downtown Arts District. EWLA features a curated exhibition of art and resources, focused on the process of art making. An emcee led exchange event will initiate live exchanges and focused discussions. Demonstrations by artists and resource providers add an educational component, with topics such as recycling in art and interdisciplinary collaborations. 
 
 WEBSITE: EW’s collaborative platform allows artists to post their artwork and resource providers to post resources available for exchange. We will streamline online and offline efforts to make exchanges more common and convenient. Participants can register, sign up for alerts, create posts, contact others and book EW Art + Public offers. A feedback system will help foster trust among participants. 
 
 REVENUE: Posting and contacting others on the website is free. Revenue will be generated through additional premium services, commissions on EW Art + Public bookings and sponsorship opportunities for LA businesses.","Major challenges include building trust among participants and match making between artists and resource providers. 
 
 EWLA brings people together who most likely don’t know each other. We will initiate introductions between participants to help build relationships and facilitate fair exchanges. Participants will be encouraged to include social media links on their online profile pages to make connections and find friends or colleagues in common. We will also implement a participant-driven feedback feature that will foster trust and accountability among participants.
 
 Each exchange has a unique set of variables and finding the ideal match between artists and resource providers can be a challenge. We are developing an exchange survey and agreement to help establish more specific criteria for exchanges and a suggested protocol to streamline the exchange process. As the EWLA community grows and more art and resources become available, exchanging will become easier and more common.","EWLA will be evaluated by how it meets the following goals and associated metrics:
 
 - Secure 5,000 registered participants and additional 15,000 website visitors across LA County in 2016, with exponential growth monthly. Site traffic, open / click through rates and number of social shares per post will be tracked through our website. 
 
 - Attract 2,000 visitors to our events. EWLA events are free and coincide with gallery openings in the area. Registration for events will be tracked at the door and online.
 
 - Facilitate at least 100 exchanges in LA County in 2016. Participants change the status of their posts as they are completed and are encouraged to share stories about exchanges. 
 
 - Based on past EW feedback, exposure from EWLA may result in paid jobs and new clients for both artists and resource providers. We will request specific feedback regarding opportunities that result from EWLA.
 
 - Revenue from premium services, EW Art + Public and sponsorships are tracked on EW.","There are non-profit organizations in LA, such as reDiscover Center, Trade School Los Angeles, and community time banks, which are doing similar work, with a different focus. In addition, other arts organizations support contemporary artists in complementary ways. 
 
 EWLA is unique because it provides a non-monetary option for individuals and businesses to support artists specifically through exchanges, which currently does not exist online. EWLA focuses on connecting professional visual artists to individuals and businesses to make creative and practical exchanges. An exchange through EW is a framework for mutually beneficial interactions and collaborations, revolving around art. 
 
 LA artists, like all artists, have a continuous need for resources. The people and businesses that have these resources enjoy supporting artists, while gaining access to valuable artwork. EWLA closes the gap between artists and the public and addresses the continuous need for artists to find resources to create their work in a more affordable, convenient and sustainable way.
 
 Additionally, as a business in the growing creative economy, we can fund our business through revenue generated by our platform and additional capital. EWLA allows us to research and further develop our program here in LA, where we are based. It is a key part of the overall expansion of the ExchangeWorks platform both nationally and internationally.","In the past, ExchangeWorks has worked with LA based non-profits, such as Clockshop, to secure some of the supplies for artists’ projects they produced. EW secured over 150 gallons of paint, from Home Depot, Do it Best Hardware, and PAR Paint Company, among other local stores that supported the creation of public artwork. 
 
 As part of EWLA, we will build strategic partnerships with LA arts organizations and venues to identify artists who need assistance, help solve production challenges through exchanges and cross promote our efforts. Partnerships with businesses will also be developed, to provide a way for excess inventory and equipment to be offered through an ongoing exchange program. Available resources can be put to good use and save artists and organizations thousands of dollars. In exchange for resources, artwork or recognition at exhibitions and online may be offered. 
 
 We will discuss collaborations with government agencies to explore a recycling program that includes materials that are useful to artists. We will also build alliances with universities, such as UCLA, Otis College of Art and Design, The California Institute of the Arts, and Santa Monica College, to share information about EWLA with their staff and students and discuss potential resources from their facilities. 
 
 We are exploring partnerships with professional associations of architects, designers, technologists and others. EWLA partners and collaborators will receive acknowledgement on our website. We do not have plans to allocate funds to partners at this time.","The proposed research, development and implementation of EWLA will cost $100,000.","PERSONNEL

 Artists who want to engage with others offline can participate in EW Art + Public. EW Art + Public is a section of the ExchangeWorks website that fosters art appreciation, unique art experiences and supplemental income for artists. EW Art + Public connects artists offering classes, tours, workshops and other art related experiences to the public. 
 
 We provide the infrastructure for EW Art + Public and the artist can decide whether to charge a fee for their program or offer it for free. Attendees pay the fee through PayPal on ExchangeWorks. The artists receive the majority of the fee, with EW receiving a 13% commission per booking.
 
 ExchangeWorks currently has a network of 7,000 artists, resource providers and others from all over the world. In 2016 our goal is to grow our community in LA to include an additional 5,000 registered participants and 15,000 website visitors.
 
 We will explore the feasibility of hiring a permanent staff and securing a permanent space in Downtown LA to act as a warehouse to store resources, office and event space.
 
 Based on what we learn in Los Angeles, we will expand with similar focused programs in other major art capitals, such as NY, Chicago and Miami. This will also enable our participants in LA to have more opportunities to make exchanges with people from other cities."

Using surveys and interviews with voters and local officials, historical and real-time voter data, and website and user experience analytics, we plan to explore and answer the following questions:
 
 - Turnout and engagement - How does the option to vote online impact voter turnout in the 35 neighborhood councils that have signed on to use the system? What is the impact on turnout among young adults? What other kinds of local civic engagement are affected by the online voting option?
 
 - Design, implementation, and analytics - Map the process of voting to understand voter behavior and barriers to participation. How could the design and implementation of the voting platform, and the avenues through which users find and access it, be improved in future elections?
 
 - Best practices - Which neighborhood councils experienced the biggest boost in turnout because of the online option, and what can we learn from them? What are the best practices for other local, state, and national governments looking to implement online voting?","A major challenge with any proposal related to participation in local elections is the extremely low turnout rate. There are 96 neighborhood councils representing over 3.5 million residents across the City of Los Angeles, but turnout in most neighborhood council elections is <1%. Our strategy to overcome this challenge is not for this election cycle - which we will study, but not intervene in - but future cycles. By studying which neighborhood councils see significant increases in turnout related to online voting and comparing them with those that do not, we will identify best practices and develop election guides that help neighborhood councils maximize turnout in future elections.","Successful outcomes for this project include:
 - Produce research and recommendations that are used by local officials across LA, and that contribute to expanded participation in neighborhood council elections.
 - Identify and distribute best practices for expanding voter turnout using easy-to-use online voting platforms that are as secure as possible given current technological limitations.
 - Help to test and refine online voting technologies in lower stakes elections like neighborhood councils before they are used in larger elections.","According to our partners in the neighborhood councils, no one else has approached them about studying the impact of online voting on voter participation in neighborhood council elections.","Civic Tech USC will have sole responsibility for managing this project, but we have the strong support of numerous local officials including Grayce Liu, General Manager of EmpowerLA, the department that runs the neighborhood council system.

The network includes 17 diverse public middle and high schools that infuse Facing History content across grade levels and disciplines to increase students’ ability to relate history to their own lives; heighten their understanding of the origins of bigotry and hatred; and engage them in creating change in their communities.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,Play,"Facing History instruction does not simply nurture students’ academic growth; it provides them with complementary skills for thriving in a diverse, collaborative 21st century economy. The organization’s approach, which is infused throughout Partnership Schools’ culture and curricula, significantly increases student engagement, empathy, critical thinking skills, and sense of civic responsibility. Facing History students are nearly twice as likely to be motivated to learn, more likely to stand up to bullying, and demonstrate significantly less racist attitudes than students in non-Facing History classrooms.
 
 The 17 Partner School communities come together to examine issues that affect all LA citizens. To kick off the 2015-16 school year, students, teachers, administrators, and parents from diverse neighborhoods across the city attended the annual Partner School Summit on Saturday, October 3. This year’s Partner School Network theme is “The Promise of Los Angeles.” The summit featured the film Tom Bradley’s Impossible Dream. This film tells the powerful story of how Mr. Bradley became the first mayor of a major American city without a black majority. Mr. Bradley built a coalition of African Americans, Jews, Whites, Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans who came together in support of common values. After viewing the film, participants examined its lessons and created action plans to reshape or improve their respective school cultures. These projects empower students to be active participants in building inclusive and effective learning environments and communities. 
 
 Throughout the year, Facing History Partnership Schools encourage their students to act as “upstanders”—people who take action to address problems in their communities, as opposed to bystanders who do nothing. At the conclusion of the school year, the network reconvenes for the Upstander Celebration, which honors students who have taken positive action in their schools and communities.
 
 The support of LA2050 and contest voters will help Facing History add four schools to the network this year. If brought to scale, the Facing History Partner School Network will not only help enhance the quality of education in LA by 2050, but also build a future generation of compassionate, inclusive, and thoughtful leaders.","Based on our work establishing and growing the Partnership Schools Network over the past six years, Facing History anticipates continued challenges related to school leadership turnover and school consolidation. Leadership transitions have made it difficult for some schools to maintain their membership in the network, but our partnerships have been able to persevere in schools where Facing History has built a strong, broad base of support among teachers. In schools with high year-to-year teacher turnover, highly experienced Facing History teachers have been able to provide orientation and guidance for new teachers who have not yet received professional development services from the organization. Facing History will continue to meet these challenges by deepening existing relationships with educators, offering them ongoing professional development opportunities and individualized support.","Primary liaisons at each of the 17 Partner Schools will complete a survey about the faculty’s collective experience with Facing History school climate initiatives, classroom implementation activities, and network event participation related to the School Summit and Upstander Celebration. This feedback will help inform future improvements to all Partner School Network activity in future years.
 
 An additional measure of success will be the overall renewal rate of Partnership Schools for the 2016-17 school year. 
 
 More than 140 internal and external studies have demonstrated Facing History’s positive impact on students. Among many findings, these studies show that Facing History students: have increased understanding and willingness to interact with other ethnic groups; marked decreases in racist attitudes; and reduced fighting behavior.","Facing History trains and supports teachers at Partnership Schools to integrate the study of history and literature with ethical decision making, innovative teaching strategies, and social-emotional learning. In an era of high teacher turnover in urban schools, studies have shown that Facing History’s professional development increases educators’ engagement, satisfaction, and sense of personal accomplishment. Educators who participate in professional development sessions receive year-round follow-up support from a Facing History staff member. Facing History is unique, individualized follow-up support includes curriculum planning consultations, classroom visits, model lesson plans, and access to a lending library of resources.
 
 Facing History's content is aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in literacy. CCSS implementation tools and resources are integrated into the organization's professional development offerings to providing teachers with support for these instructional shifts. Facing History recently completed a two-year project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) that expanded the organization’s CCSS-aligned resources and support, and was recently approved for a new, two year grant from BMGF to continue this work. The 2015 guide from the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) cited Facing History as the only organization with well-designed, evidence-based programs that impact students’ social and emotional development at both the middle and high school levels. 
 
 Outside of the classroom, Facing History works with all Partner School faculty on positive school climate initiatives to enhance students’ leadership competencies and create safe, reflective learning environments. On-site trainings help faculty members develop a school-wide vocabulary that encourages unity and a shared sense of ownership of the school community among all students.
 
 By using an approach that leverages highly effective professional development for educators, Facing History’s Partner School Network is able to improve students’ academic engagement and social-emotional learning, nurture hard-working teachers, and build safe, inclusive learning communities that prepare students for success in work, life, and civil society.","Seventeen public or charter schools within LAUSD, all classified as Title I schools, will be active members of the network during the 2015-16 school year. The following LAUSD schools are members of the Facing History Partnership Schools Network. They are primarily located in East LA, South LA, downtown, and the San Fernando Valley:

 As previously described, Facing History featured the film Tom Bradley’s Impossible Dream as part of the School Summit event held on October 3rd. This event was held in collaboration with the filmmakers and the family of Mr. Bradley. The film, which has not yet been released to the public, was followed by a panel discussion with filmmaker Alison Sotomayor and Tom Bradley’s daughter, long-time teacher Lorraine Bradley. A copy of the film has been provided to each partner school with many network members planning to screen the film during the school year for their student bodies. Ms. Sotomayor and Ms. Bradley hope to attend many of these screenings and participate in Q&A sessions for students to enhance their understanding of the film’s message. 
 
 Facing History is headquartered in Brookline, MA and has regional offices in Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, New England, New York, and San Francisco in addition to LA with international partner affiliates in Toronto and London. Facing History staff regularly share best practices, resources, and strategies with one another. LA teachers and students are therefore being supported by an entire network of professional development experts that have a breadth of experience far beyond the confines of the city.","For the 2015-16 school year, Facing History anticipates that the project and all related events will cost $250,720. In addition to this LA2050 application, the organization will submit renewal grant requests to past project supporters to fund the remaining $150,720. Any additional expenses incurred will be covered by general operating funds provided by individual donors and event sponsorships. 
 
 The value of each unique school partnership is assessed at $10,000-$25,000, depending on the level of services needed. Bringing on a new Partnership Schools, for instance, has higher costs than maintaining a Partner School, including more initial teacher training, class sets of books and educational resources, and more Facing History staff assistance for implementing positive school culture initiatives in their first year of membership. Facing History has four new member schools during the 2015-16 school year. The $100,000 grant from LA2050 would fully fund these four new partner schools, allowing for projected growth to continue into future years.
 
 The Facing History Partnership Schools Network has been supported in the past by many generous individual donors and private foundation grants. The network began as a pilot program funded by the Johnny Carson Foundation in 2009 with five charter members. Since that initial investment, the Johnny Carson Foundation has provided additional support to fund the network’s growth. Additional funding for the network has been generously provided by the Rose Hills Foundation, the Harold McAlister Charitable Foundation, and the Weingart Foundation.","Salaries and Benefits - $144,140

 *Stipends and substitute fees are for educators who take on leadership roles in carrying out Facing History activities at their schools, which requires additional training sessions and meetings. Partner School teachers are also invited to a symposium on urban education, held annually in the Spring, which requires substitute time as well.
 
 ** Indirect costs are essential services including information technology, human resources, and finance.","The Partnership Schools Network has grown from five schools in 2009 to 17 LAUSD public and charter schools with a combined enrollment of more than 10,000 students. The organization’s goal is to expand this network to 25 partner schools by the end of the 2016-17 school year, with growth continuing beyond that level in future years.
 
 A major challenge for Facing History in growing the network is securing the monetary and staffing resources needed to meet the current demand of LAUSD schools that want to join the network. As previously described, new network schools require approximately $25,000 worth of professional development support and resources. The LA2050 grant would fully fund the activation of four new partnership schools in 2015-16. 
 
 Facing History also plans to increase the visibility of the Partnership Schools Network in order to scale up, creating additional demand from non-member schools and inspiring upstanding behavior in students and adults throughout the city. The culminating event for the Partnership Schools Network each year is an Upstander Celebration in which network schools nominate students who have gone above and beyond in service of others. Two examples from last year’s celebration event exemplify the powerful example that Facing History’s Partnership Schools can provide for the LA community. Students at Watts Learning Center Charter Middle School undertook a comprehensive project that cleaned up a once blighted neighborhood street. Graduating seniors at the Academy of Medical Arts, Carson High School transformed an unused part of their school grounds into an outdoor classroom for students and community members to study plants and learn how to use container gardens to grow food. 
 
 Facing History will publicize these stories through social media channels, blog posts, and newsletters in addition to seeking broadcast and print media coverage. These stories inspire others throughout LA and raise awareness of the network’s positive impact on LAUSD.
 
 The steady success of this project has already created ripples outside of LA. The Partner School Network model is now being replicated in other regions of the country.

As the city begins to grow, and our lives become more digital, finding true community can be difficult, especially as an artist. 
 
 With an ever changing industry, musicians and artists alike are becoming more independently driven. The purpose of FEAL.LA is to provide a support network for musicians and creatives to flourish, while fostering community. 
 
 As we build our program, we will grow to understand what needs for independent artists, and the surrounding community are not being addressed, and how we can create a space that truly houses everything an artists needs to grow.
 
 Music and art bring people together, and has the capacity to change lives. FEAL.LA works to give back to those who help us understand what it means to feel.","Everyday there is something new, and exciting popping up in Los Angeles, and everyday there is someone looking to grab our attention. 
 
 As we grow the FEAL.LA program, the major challenge we will see is the initial captivation of the our audience. How will we stand out?
 
 Our approach is personal; FEAL.LA only works when everyone involved benefits. So we thought we would start with small events, including intimate shows, to see how we can create evolving, unique experiences for Los Angeles.","FEAL.LA is entering into phase one of a larger vision. 
 
 PHASE ONE: COMMUNITY
 PHASE TWO: PLATFORM
 PHASE THREE: CREATION
 PHASE FOUR: EDUCATION
 
 In order to create a sanctuary, first you must find your people.
 
 In Phase One, we will build our program from musicians, while pulling in the surrounding community through connection, both physically and digitally. With an already established network of artists, and industry leaders, we will activate experiences that harness collaboration, and build content to share with the world.
 
 With this grant, we are able to rent a venue to prototype our vision. As well, as provide us the chance to build a digital platform for artists and the Los Angeles community to connect and grow. 
 
 We can track our progress based off of the following criteria:
 
 Space activated
 Website creation
 Traffic both at events, and on our website
 Email sign-ups through our website to participate in events
 Growth of Social engagement via digital content","Absolutely, in a way, every venue and recording studio is our competition. We see this as an opportunity. 
 
 As an artist embarks on the journey of creative expression, the support around them is vital to their success. FEAL.LA’s goal is to create an interconnected community of artists, businesses, and individuals who want to invest in the future of music. 
 
 Our unique one-stop-shop approach in this collaborative space, allows more freedom and support for the artist to grow, create, and share.","As FEAL.LA grows, we invite many partners and collaborators to get involve.

5102220,Fermenting Change: Connecting Los Angeles through food and faith,2015144,,,"The Fermenting Change Event Series will bring together people from diverse communities over our shared values of nourishing food and land stewardship. Our program will engage Jewish and Muslim school communities and grow to become a replicable model for interfaith celebration across the region. By building connections around food, justice, and traditional ties to the earth, we build relationships across religious and cultural barriers to create an interconnected and resilient Los Angeles.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Live,"One of the obstacles to civic engagement and a unified community is cultural divides: we are a diverse city where people of different backgrounds live side by side, yet in isolation. At Netiya, we believe there is unity in diversity and that beneath our differences lie commonalities. As an interfaith organization, we bring together different groups under a shared agenda: food and stewardship of the land--topics that are common to all faiths and cultures. 
 
 We propose an event series--Fermenting Change--with the goal of creating cross-cultural understanding and engagement around the critical issues of food justice and land stewardship. To enhance the impact of our events, we will also host eight workshops and/or volunteer events throughout the year. 
 
 To pilot Fermenting Change, we will create a Jewish-Muslim partnership, bringing together communities in a celebration of common food traditions, ties to agrarian roots, and commitments to social action. We’ll implement the pilot with Sinai Akiba Academy (a Jewish school) and New Horizon School (a Muslim school), both members of Netiya’s interfaith network that will be implementing Netiya’s Just Food & Gardens program at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 respectively. As part of those programs, both schools are creating edible gardens on their properties, and hosting educational workshops on topics ranging from gardening and pest management to water-wise technology, traditional cooking preservation, and food justice. More details on our Just Food & Gardens program can be found here: http://www.netiya.org/programs/
 
 Next, we will use lessons learned from the pilot to go beyond a Jewish-Muslim partnership to draw in communities of all faiths. We will host a second event using our 42-member network of faith institutions to create a truly universal and interfaith gathering. The event will be both educational--providing classes and workshops--and inspirational, giving participants the tools and connections to participate in volunteer opportunities, advocate for relevant policy changes, and become ambassadors for food justice in their own communities. 
 
 We see the Fermenting Change series both as a community connection in itself, and also as a means to inspire action and interaction outside of the events. Our events will galvanize participants around social change and food issues, resulting in more city-wide participation in volunteer and cultural events both within and outside of the congregation community.","With any event and volunteer program, the challenge is always in ensuring awareness of the events and actual participation. That’s why faith institutions are so critical to our mission and purpose. Our faith institutions are strong and have dedicated memberships that are eager to participate in congregational activities. Our congregations have all the force of numbers that we need: where Netiya steps in is in bringing these congregations together. Netiya has an existing network of 42 faith institutions which is continually expanding. These are faith institutions that are not only interested in social justice but also interfaith collaboration. We will overcome the obstacle of event participation by drawing on our strong partnerships with congregations. Our partners bring the willing and interested community members, and we bring the opportunity and programming in which to participate.","We will evaluate our impact on civic and social engagement, with the goal that our programs will enhance people’s participation both within their own communities (geographic, cultural, or religious) and their interaction and cooperation with other communities.
 
 Specifically we will look at:
 --overall participation in two major festival events of 2016, one focused on communities of Sinai Akiba Academy and New Horizon School together and one for the general public
 --participation by Fermenting Change attendees at Netiya workshops and volunteer events, as measured by attendance records
 --participation by Fermenting Change attendees at other volunteer and cultural events, as measured through participant surveys
 --attitudes and interest around social action and inter-faith collaboration, as measured by surveys with participants, newsletter readership","Netiya’s focus on collaboration is what sets us apart from many other programs. There are groups that work in the Christian, Muslim, or Jewish world but few that are working not only across the geography of the one of the largest counties in the country but also very intentionally across ethnic and faith lines. We seek to move from conflict, distrust, and former ""battleground"" to breaking new ground, working side by side and ultimately to breaking bread together on ""common ground"" while strengthening the surrounding community. Netiya is not a faith institution itself; rather, we show our faith-based partners how to use their traditions to connect to community, to cultivate and provide fresh food, to steward their land for environmental conservation, and to promote our common values of justice for those in need.Their facilities and landscapes are grounds for modeling positive stewardship and learning to become both more giving and more self-reliant communities.
 
 Founded in 2011, Netiya has grown a collaborative network of 42 faith-based institutions across the Greater Los Angeles Area. We have installed 13 Just Gardens, and organized over 160 community-wide educational programs in the past four years on topics ranging from food procurement to food relief; from GMOs to integrated pest control and composting in your congregation's garden; and from fermenting change in a food desert to fermenting food from the garden. We have forged a Board; an Executive Council of seven community leaders from our network institutions that meet weekly; and a network of liaisons from our member institutions that meets twice a year. For the past four years Netiya has partnered with over 60 congregations and organizations all over Los Angeles County to create customized programming for their campers, students, staff, and/or congregants.
 
 We’ve seen how our work can not only grow gardens but also grow leaders and community. Past events include our Local Food Procurement trainings which have resulted in 17 institutions sourcing their food locally. Our 2012 GMO teach-in successfully combined the social and spiritual, utilizing a partner synagogue as host for an event that taught the public critical knowledge about their food. Our Shared Earth Project--a collaboration between a Unitarian Universalist Church and two Jewish Synagogues--has proven that the process of building a garden and sharing a love of food can bring different cultures and faiths together.","Our partners will include:
 --New Horizon School
 New Horizon School seeks to develop in each student a positive identity as an American Muslim who is prepared intellectually, socially, emotionally, spiritually, and physically to succeed in a diverse and ever-changing world. New Horizon will host garden volunteer workdays, educational workshops, and will host Fermenting Change events. All events will be open to the public. 
 --Sinai Akiba Academy
 Sinai Akiba Academy is committed to Jewish heritage and traditions. They welcome Jewish students of all backgrounds and affiliations to observe life cycle events, for prayer, rituals, learning, music, and community. Sinai Akiba will host garden volunteer workdays, educational workshops, and will host Fermenting Change events. All events will be open to the public. 
 --Slow Food LA
 The Slow Food Los Angeles Chapter supports local efforts in the worldwide movement to reconnect people with their food and all that it takes to produce it. Slow Food LA members will assist with event programming and outreach for Fermenting Change. 
 --University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE)
 UCCE operates the Master Gardeners Program (and until earlier this year, the Master Food Preserver program), with the purpose of training people in gardening and food preservation so that their their skills can be imparted to the community. As part of their certification, Master Gardeners and Food Preservers must donate their time to train and teach their skills. Fermenting Change will work with members of these two programs to put on its workshops and event activities. 
 --Proyecto Jardin
 Proyecto Jardin is a community garden in Boyle Heights that is focused on the principles of sustainability to mobilize collective action for food justice. Proyecto Jardin will be a partner on the second Fermenting Change Festival, assisting with outreach, organizing programming, and possibly hosting the main event.
 --Netiya institution network
 42 religious institutions are members of Netiya’s network. Member institutions are located all over the county and include congregations, schools, and service organizations from a variety of religious affiliations. Members of the network will assist with outreach for Fermenting Change. 
 
 Our partners will not be sub-granted a designated portion of the grant, but grant funds will pay for services that Netiya normally charges fees for and will cover costs of program activities that take place at their sites.","Our overall anticipated cost is $110,250.

This touches every demographic sector – racial and economic – and represents a hugely powerful force in community. We estimate that virtually every Angeleno lives within walking distance of a religious institution--imagine if each of those institutions was a resource to host educational opportunities around food, sustainability, and our most pressing social issues for ALL in the neighborhood, of ANY faith? What if even a small portion of those institutions had an edible garden that grew food for the community and inspired others to do the same? The impact would be enormous, and this is the vision that Netiya wants to realize.
 
 The Fermenting Change agenda that we plan to implement in 2016 will be the beginning of a replicable and sustainable program to engage citizens of our diverse community. From the success and lessons of 2016, we can not only host more Fermenting Change events, but inspire and train more and more participants to do meaningful volunteer work and engage in social action. We believe that with Fermenting Change we can lay the groundwork for activism that connects people across religious boundaries, cultural barriers, social class, and geography."
5102102,FLY Yoga Arts: Enhancing Academic Education Through Integrated Movement and Creative Arts Play!,2015065,,,"FLY Yoga Arts is a comprehensive curriculum of games, mindfulness and movement-based education designed for in-class or after school learning and play. During the next year FLY seeks to train 1000 Los Angeles area educators to implement the FLY curriculum in their classrooms. The FLY mission to “teach the teachers” will empower educators to seamlessly integrate play, movement and “mindful moments” into their classrooms with the result of keeping students balanced and engaged in learning.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,ALL,"Our California Public Schools are in crisis, and the impact on the staff and students is generally one of low morale and low self-confidence in a struggling system. FLY Yoga Arts is committed to reintroducing a love for learning to both students and educators by using a completely innovative curriculum that understands and points to the personal gifts of each and every student and educator.
 
 Through play-based curriculum including art, dance, music, yoga and “mindful moments,” FLY helps children get the most out of their academic subjects including reading, math and science. Academic research in the fields of neuroscience, education, psychology and medicine have shown yoga and mindfulness practices to reliably increase academic performance, improve emotional well-being, and reduce behavioral challenges all while building strength, flexibility and balance. 
 Our curriculum highlights these evidence-based practices along with imaginative play, mental and physical wellness, and concentration/ attention training. In collaboration with students, teachers, parents and caregivers, 
 our aim is to impact academic progress and long-term success in each of our students by giving them personalized learning blueprints. 
 In addition to providing play-based classes for students throughout LAUSD, our 2015-2016 goal is to train a thousand educators and program facilitators to integrate our curriculum into their schools. We will provide audio, video and written guidebooks that interlace mindfulness, movement and creativity into each school's ongoing programming. This training will allow educators to implement the FLY curriculum seamlessly throughout the school day.
 FLY seeks to cultivate connection and engagement. By bringing PLAY into learning, engaging students through their abundant energy and helping them integrate their school day lessons into fun, the FLY curriculum will help equip students, along with their teachers and families, to deal with daily stressors. Our program establishes community, enhances healthy self- image and communication, and keeps kids and teachers excited to come to school each day.","Due to growing demand from the community to have FLY Yoga Arts in LA’s schools, it is necessary to put a timeline together to ensure all staff is fully trained and ready to implement our program as soon as possible. This may require some additional funds in order to procure spaces for weekend trainings, to pay the FLY Yoga Arts staff for their additional time, to create any necessary materials in a timely manner, and especially, ensuring that implementation is properly monitored. Our current staff if small, and we focus on building meaningful and long lasting partnerships with every FLY School. A part of our budget in the coming year will go toward our staff growing to meet the needs of day-to-day communication, scheduling and facilitation of FLY instructors and other administrative tasks.","1. We will evaluate sense of safety and community benefit through a survey of students, teachers, and staff who participate in our program.
 2. We will work with schools to monitor a shift in academic achievement and behavioral trends as a result of participating in our after school programming.
 3. We will track student's mental and social understanding through assignments that highlight self reflection, decision making skills, and community building.
 4. We will survey parents in order to garner an understanding of their child’s energy level, focus, and communication skills beyond the school day.
 5. We will complete surveys in collaboration with school staff at the beginning and end of each workshop and training, as well as at the end of the implementation time to get a sense of their experience with classroom management, learning trends, and community wellbeing.
 6. To track the progress of teachers who have received training, we will provide consultation and personal mentoring.","While there are various organizations (both profit and non) bringing Mindfulness, Yoga, and Creative Arts to schools through classes, workshops, and staff development trainings, FLY is unique in its formula, providing lesson plans, curriculum and student development benchmarks, evaluations and materials. We have tailored our program to each school in order to work within a presented model, while initiating new techniques to benefit the unique students. 
 
 One example of our play-based learning is a game in which the students physically make the shape of a “Letter of the Day.” We may write words with our bodies and with playful artistic materials, making songs, and creating poetry that will make a possible lifetime imprint in our minds. Truly, through joy, every child learns in an integrated and complete way.
 
 Our methodology is also totally innovative, and is continuing to be developed at the Harvard Graduate school of Education, with our creator and director Haley Dawn. FLY utilizes the best of Somatic Learning, Flow Experience, and Play Therapy to enhance each child’s learning.","We are currently working with LA's Best Enrichment Program, within their ASAP(After School Arts Program), bringing our own Teaching Artists and giving 20 class sessions to different schools around LA. We would love to use our partnership with them to continue and further our relationship with schools around the LA Area. The monetary gains of the grant would be going to further our ability to offer quality programming, however the program itself would not be the receiver of the funds. If there is necessary compensation for the connection or for training for their staff or teachers under the FLY umbrella, we will utilize part of administration fees for this.","For this transitional year of programming, we can happily work within a $100,000 budget to cover staff, new material creation, and materials for fifteen schools. If additional staff is needed and more schools demand FLY staff in order to grow our numbers, we will seek private funding or support from our other classes and communities. 
 We hope that this money will jump start a program that could eventually be self sustaining, utilizing the surplus from programs that are paid in full by parents and families, to support the programs for teachers and schools that would not be able.","$65,000 would go to FLY Staff: to be used toward our FLY Teaching Artist trainings, administrative staff, teaching artist budget and personnel expenses related to travel and materials.
  
 $25,000 will go into creating new materials:
 $17,500- Video & Audio creation and reproduction
 $ 7,500- Workbooks, and Class Worksheets to be distributed en masse to LA’s Best sites.
  
 $10,000 will be used to provide any addition school needed materials: $4500- 30 yoga mats/ school
 $3000- 1 deck of our FLY yoga cards/ instructions school
 $1000- a working music player/ school
 $1500- 1 prop bag/ school, including art supplies, and miscellaneous teaching props like stickers, feathers, balloons, balls etc.","FLY will send our FLY Teaching Artists to lead large staff and teacher trainings for LAUSD schools as well as provide ongoing staff support. Teachers will be trained to implement the play and movement based curriculum independently in their classrooms.
 
 We will create surveys & communication plans that monitor each staff member's understanding and ability to implement lessons in an authentic way, as well as each student's academic progress, level of happiness, and ability to communicate & connect.
 
 To keep true to its vision, FLY will create video/ audio recordings to aid in introducing exercises and provide clear curriculum materials: lesson plans, intentions, teacher handbooks, and student worksheets to every participating school.
 
 FLY will also provide all necessary materials and equipment including in class tools and curriculum elements such as flash cards, handouts, yoga mats, art supplies, to support our program for a full calendar year."

Elements of the park include an amphitheater, California native plant landscaping, significant tree canopy to mitigate pollution, water-efficient irrigation, picnic area, adventure play area for youth, shaded seating, solar panels, bicycle racks, nature trails, and free Wi-Fi.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6351 West Franklin Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90028",Learn,"This project will create a new recreational feature by transforming a currently vacant and deteriorated site into a unique, aesthetically pleasing, multiple-benefit natural park by improving the landscaping, and adding supporting amenities such as an amphitheater, nature trails, adventure play area, interpretive elements to help educate users about natural resources, picnic area with free Wi-Fi, and art plaza for community gathering and interacting. Additionally, the park will feature all California-native drought-tolerant landscaping which will provide habitat for local wildlife, provide shade, generate oxygen, and remove pollutants from the air thus helping to reduce the adverse impacts of global warming. The park will also feature a solar panel collector which will provide power for the energy needs of the park and will educate the public about the benefit of energy savings.
 This project will also add much needed park space to Los Angeles as there is currently a critical lack of parks to play in. The project’s close proximity of the nearby public and private schools and apartments will ensure that a good majority both youth and adults are able to access and play in the park. The park will feature areas designated for play that are made of natural components such as plants, logs, boulders, hills and trees. These components represent a unique “wild environment” in a way that provides the feeling of being in nature but is safe and manageable to young visitors. A few man-made components have been carefully integrated to support creative play, encourage confident exploration and help children develop a lasting affinity for the natural world. Seniors and other family members will similarly benefit from this open space through genuine recreational opportunities via walking trails, gathering areas for social and cultural interaction, new learning experiences, and a greatly improved environmental experience. 
 There has been much research on the subject of the benefits of outdoor play. Playing outside helps children to understand and respect nature, the environment and the interdependence of humans, animals, plants, and lifecycles. While play is crucial for a child’s development, it is also beneficial for people of all ages. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you. The new Franklin-Ivar Park will provide the Los Angeles community with a safe outdoor space for more play.","One of the reoccurring concerns expressed by the community both during the outreach phase of the project and in subsequent community meetings is safety. This concern has been addressed in the design of the park by including secure perimeter fencing and by strategically planting so that site lines are open and allow for visibility. This will continue to be addressed once the park opens with periodic patrols by agency staff, camera surveillance, coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department and Caltrans, and through the active use of the space by the public. The most effective deterrent to ‘bad use’ is positive and increased use by families, seniors, and youth, and the park has been designed to maximize participation by these user groups.","As the project is located in a park-poor community, the mere existence of the park will be a gauge of its success as it will add new recreational space for families, children and the community to play in. We expect that is park will be heavily used, given the involvement and anticipation displayed to-date by the local residents. The success of the project will be evaluated, in part, by the frequency of its use and future stewardship. A Friends of Franklin-Ivar Park group may be established to ensure continued stewardship for the space, engage the community, encourage park use and activate the space. The picnic and plaza area was designed to accommodate a farmer’s market allowing neighbors the opportunity to interact and purchase fresh local produce. The children’s play area will be utilized by kids from all economic groups fostering friendships and improving their physical health. MRCA may conduct surveys to evaluate and summarize the anticipated use vs. the actual use of the park.","There are other organizations who have complementary goals in the Los Angeles area, including California State Parks and City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. 
 
 The MRCA’s approach is unique because we incorporate park elements that provide more than just recreation: Our goal is to bring ‘nature’ to the City by developing natural parks that serve to also provide habitat for local wildlife, educate the public, and provide much needed public access to open space. Additionally, we approach projects in a manner that involves the surrounding community in a valuable way. The local community participated in the planning process for this park during an in-depth community outreach process through 12 community meetings to ensure that residents felt comfortable and engaged. As a result, the final design is ultimately considered to be the ‘community’s vision’. Two of the key points that informed the design direction were: Residents wanted a natural children’s play area; and natural open space areas were important to nearly every participant. 
 
 Lastly, the long term operation and maintenance of the project will be the responsibility of MRCA. The MRCA is a local public agency who’s mission is to protect land and provide public access to natural lands in southern California. Since its inception, the MRCA has designed, planned and constructed scores of natural park projects throughout Los Angeles. The MRCA’s successful operation of our existing parks is compelling proof that the long-term success of the Franklin-Ivar Park is ensured. The agency has an established reputation for high-quality maintenance and maintains a positive presence in both our urban parks and natural open spaces.","The MRCA has partnered with a number of entities in the planning of this project including: 
 • Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) – As the land-owner, the Conservancy is our largest partner. Due to MRCA’s expertise in urban park projects, the Conservancy has delegated long-term responsibility to plan, develop, and maintain the property.
 • City Councilmembers David Ryu and Mitch O-Farrell – Although the park is technically in Councilmember Ryu’s district, it sits on the border of the two Council Districts. MRCA met with Councilmen O’Farrell, who is supportive and committed to help in any way and has offered to facilitate, if needed, to make the project move forward in a timely manner. Councilman O’Farrell has a history of being helpful with the creation of small pocket parks as well as larger endeavors like the greening of the Los Angeles River. Councilman Ryu took office in July 2015 and is also supportive of the project.
 • Hollywood/Los Angeles Beautification Team (HLABT) – Their mission is “To improve the quality of life in Los Angeles by empowering citizens to change their environments for the better.” HLABT has been a project partner since the inception of this project and has facilitated with public meeting during the conceptual design phase.
 • Additional entities/organizations that have provided partnership along the way include –
 o Former State Assemblymember (now Los Angeles City Attorney) Mike Feuer
 o Former City of Los Angeles Councilmember Tom LaBonge
 o Mayor Eric Garcetti
 o American Music and Dance Academy (AMDA) – the owners of the properties to the south of the park site
 o Cheremoya Foundation – a nearby elementary school parent’s stakeholder group
 o Argyle Civic Association – a nearby neighborhood group to the east

Electrical: $10,000","The obvious measure of the park’s success will be its frequent use by the public and the simple fact that this currently vacant and derelict site will become an active place for people to play. There is currently a large desire and need to transform this, and other vacant lots, throughout Los Angeles into spaces that the public can utilize and enjoy. The mere creation and use of this park will be a major success and a step in the right direction to clean and activate Los Angeles. 
 New urban parks of similar size were recently constructed by the MRCA and serve other park-poor neighborhoods. Constant outreach through social media such as Facebook, emails and person to person contact has allowed us to reach a wider scale of people and further the success of our public programing, resulting in higher number of attendance. The same will be done with Franklin/Ivar Park. 
 Additionally, as trees and other vegetation are proven to sequester carbon and improve our air quality, the park’s tree canopy and shrubs will almost immediately clean the air. Furthermore, air quality will be improved and greenhouse gasses will be reduced due to the park’s easy access via walking and bicycling, its close proximity to public transit, and permanent designation as open-space."
5102115,Free concerts + community = change,2015073,,,"GP believes that art can introduce us to the big issues of society and to each other – a vital role in a city as diverse as ours. For our milestone season, GP will present 50+ free cultural events including live performances and public conversations at our iconic Downtown L.A. venue plus community outreach programs serving more than 60,000 people from across the region. GP will connect audiences to artists and each other resulting in greater participation in L.A.’s cultural and civic life.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,ALL,"GP believes that access to the arts should be a right and not a privilege and that the arts play a critical role in healthy communities. Since 1987, a million Southern Californians have come to our concerts, discovered new artists and connected and engaged with those around them. In 2016, Grand Performances will:
 
 1) CELEBRATE 30 YEARS
 GP will launch a celebratory 30th season of music, dance, film, theater and spoken word that addresses local, national and even international issues through the performing arts. These programs will be complemented by post-show discussions, community gatherings, and online forums to encourage active participation from the community. This will include the second year of “re:ARRANGED - Muslim Cultures Illuminated” a 22-month cultural exchange and artist residency project that expands the definition of Muslim culture for participating local artists, underserved youth, and the general public. 
 
 2) TAKE THE SHOW ON THE ROAD 
 GP will test off-site programming collaborations through a deeper partnership with the Los Angeles City Public Library (LAPL). This will include a series of Poetry Writing and Performance workshops at three South L.A. branch libraries and a series of five viewing and discussion programs in East and North L.A. branch libraries around the “Latino Americans 500 Years of History” public programming initiative produced by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the American Library Association (ALA).
  
 3) INCREASE VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT
 GP recognizes the need to develop a well-trained volunteer force that is deeply engaged with and actively involved in the organization - as ""music docents"" for the larger audience during our free concert series, or goodwill brand ambassadors at offsite events. GP will deepen current partnerships with community organizations to engage audiences around voter registration and volunteer engagement. Organizations like the African American Voter Registration and Education Project and other community-focused operations will be onsite at our performances and be complemented by a social media campaign. 
 
 4) SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS
 Many people ask us – if the shows are free, do the artists perform for free? Not only are talented local and international artists paid competitive fees, they are supported by a crew of seasoned theatre professionals and work with our Director of Programming to develop new work and create one-of-a-kind programs.","FUNDING: While funding from California Plaza owners has been a stabilizing factor since our inception covering nearly half the budget, each summer requires greater private sector funding to cover increased production and maintenance costs, professional and competitive artist fees, and the costs of expanded marketing and new media applications to engage and inform audiences. Strategic board nominations and a focus on individual/major gifts, corporate sponsorships and new foundation partners will be a key to future growth. 
 
 PUBLIC AWARENESS: GP continues to fall under the radar for many Angelenos because there are numerous free public events from which to choose. GP has proactively embraced technology – recently improving our website and social media messaging - and 2016 will include a re-branding and viral video campaign. Being part of the LA2050 Challenge gives GP exposure on a wider public platform and helps us educate audiences about our values and message.","GP will invest in a major audience survey tracking attendance figures, demographics, # of new audience members, growth of social media participation, and artist/audience reactions to programs along with the LA2050 CONNECT metrics identified. Surveys will be deployed onsite at events with the help of volunteers and through social media and e-newsletter. Metrics provided by our web server and social media outlets provide data on # of hits, time spent on the web site, pages viewed/shared and other essential evaluation information. 
 
 While data-driven measurements are crucial, it is often the personal anecdote or story that best relates the impact of our work in the community and these stories are gathered online and through participatory activities (a new StoryCorps style initiative) at live events. A successful project will meet or exceed the following goals:
 
 Increase audience by 10%
 Increase social media followers by 25% 
 Add 100 new volunteers
 Add 500 new voters","While other free performing arts venues have emerged in Los Angeles, GP is uniquely positioned to serve the community because of the high caliber of our artists and production standards, the confidence our audience has in their experience at our venue, the diversity of artists on our stage, and deep outreach to diverse communities. 
 
 Our audience is multigenerational, multicultural, multi-ethnic and comes from every socio-economic group and geographic area of L.A. County creating an inclusive environment ripe for cultural exchange and community building. Nearly half of our audience is below the median family income for LA County ($55,476). 
 
 When underserved communities are served by performing arts presenters, it is typically through outreach activities separate from the primary performing arts program or through limited free ticket distribution. GP believes that underserved communities are served best when integrated into a diverse audience experiencing a rich and varied program. Multiple programming initiatives/themes are woven through each season that inspire and direct our community engagement strategies. It is this thoughtfully-curated programming that sets GP apart.
 
 Without the barrier of ticket prices, people can connect with the art and each other in deeper and more meaningful ways. Grand Performances builds community and promotes cross-cultural understanding by providing the opportunity to see one’s own culture validated and the chance to get an informed view of other cultures. 
 
 “It's organizations like Grand Performances that keep the essence of communities alive through the power of love...the power of music.” - artist Fared Shafinury (2013)
 
 “Although I live 60 miles North of LA, I come down as often as possible to get arts and culture. I have been exposed to so much diverse, exotic music by GP, and met so many kind and wonderful people. The oasis that is California Plaza is an amazing open air showcase nestled in the heart of DTLA. If it weren't for music, I wouldn't be here today. Thanks to Grand Performances, for enriching our lives with so much good stuff. I can't wait for the next season.” - audience member Lamar (2014)
 
 “Never in 1,000 years did we think we would end a night like this....Stevie Wonder. The stage was on fire… LaLa land is alive and thankful tonight. From Downey, CA we always have loved Grand Performances… thank you for keeping it REAL.” – audience member Anita (2013)","Grand Performances works closely with non-arts organizations such as Downtown Women’s Center, Prototypes, The Wall Las Memorias, the African American Voter Registration and Education Project, and L.A. Bicycle Coalition to serve our audiences. These collaborations help attract new audiences to our programs while creating community dialogue around important issues. Some deeper partnerships planned for 2016 include:
 
 Council Districts: GP has established quality relations with the three Councilmembers serving the populations living within 3-5 miles of our primary venue and will continue to appropriately engage their field deputies to deepen relations with their constituents.
 
 Los Angeles Public Library: As natural collaborators, GP and LAPL have had formal and informal relations for over a decade and meetings between key staff are often held to discuss collaborative options. There have been coordinated engagements for GP artists; distribution of collateral through LAPL branches, and “Songs in the Key of LA” a major 2013 presentation which brought music from the LAPL sheet music collection to life on the GP stage drawing more than 3,500 Angelenos.
 
 Voter Registration Organizations: African-American Voter Registration and Education Project and others will be invited to be part of an onsite registration effort.
 
 Non-Profit Organizations: We will identify additional non-profit organizations in the Chicano/Latino community to dovetail with programming related to the Chicano Moratorium.","An award from LA2050 will help support the 30th anniversary season of Grand Performances which is our project. The annual programming budget is approximately $1.3 million of a $1.8 million annual operating budget. An annual fundraising plan that strives for a sustainable, diverse funding base will be employed to cover the additional programming costs.

Most importantly it will support three core priorities of a three year strategic plan 2015-17 that will propel GP’s artistic reputation, organizational vitality and sustainability for years to come. 
 
 EXPAND AUDIENCE BREADTH AND ENGAGEMENT
 GP will use data garnered from LA2050 surveys to better understand what motivates our audiences and test various modes of communication to reach deep and repeatedly into communities.
 
 GP will continue to create cross-sector opportunities that will expand our audience reach while bringing information about our partners’ services to all of the people in our audiences. 
 
 GP will position its programs be even more involved in LA neighborhoods; GP leadership has been in conversation with elected officials who are interested in securing special funding to bring GP programs to their districts because not all residents are willing and able to travel to Downtown for programs.
 
 GP will engage with more community-based organizations to reach the “high-hanging fruit” – those people, who for various cultural reasons are least likely to become part of our audiences.
 
 GP will deepen our relationships with artists who want to create work of importance and relevance to LA; and, in other ways, expand on our mission to bring performing arts to diverse audiences.
 
 ENHANCE AND DIVERSIFY FUNDING
 GP is establishing partnerships with several new sponsors and new potential funders that are recognizing we are a mission-driven performing arts organization with high standards for presentation and audience development and an eye on demonstrating the role that the arts play in civil societies. 
 
 GP has been in conversations with a number of government agencies and leading foundations to discuss partnerships and support for initiatives and expanded community engagement.

With gentrification happening at an alarming rate in DTLA, there are closures of music rehearsal studios and rental rooms going up in price. I decided to build a rehearsal space in Boyle Heights where there was none, and plan to open our doors for students to use the facility for free with grant money. 
 
 Being a musician has allowed me to travel the world, record records, sell music to film and TV, and has given me a purpose to share my vision and ideas. I want to be an example to the young people here in LA to show them that anything is possible with practice and discipline. And by giving them a space to do this in a neighborhood like Boyle Heights will surely foster some incredible ideas. 
 Findings indicate that music study uniquely enhances higher brain functions required for reading, mathematics, chess, science, and engineering. If I can be a small but positive change to give back to my community, this would be it. I know from experience that having a creative outlet is so important in keeping kids off the streets and out of trouble. Most kids just need a chance, some guidance and discipline. Music can give them that and so much more.",The only barrier I see for an after school program is that we would have to have a licensed adult teacher on site during program hours. One of our investors is a teacher and musician himself and could possibly fill this roll. We also plan to have security during business hours.,"Adventures in the arts and music expand who we are as human beings. It is part of our spiritual advancement in the ways we communicate - through melody, rhythms and lyrics- breaking down barriers, and allowing us to experience true happiness. 
 Research also shows that music can relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and help relieve pain. 
 
 We will evaluate our work through the musical advancement of the youth that utilize this program. With the youth bands that form at ESR, we would showcase a live performance at an all ages venue in Boyle Heights so they would be able to have the experience of playing live in front of an audience.
 
 More musicians make a better environment. Art makes a better city and ultimately a better world.","School of Rock is a nation wide organization with a similar idea but offers lessons. What is unique about Eastside Rehearsal is that we offer youth a space to create for those who are already interested and practicing music in a lower income neighborhood. Many of the kids in Boyle Heights don't have the money or resources to pursue musical studies. With grant money, we would open our studios for free to those interested in furthering their musical creativity. Most of the hourly rental spaces in LA are located in higher income areas like Atwater Village, Echo Park, and Eagle Rock. ESR will be run by bilingual musicians catering to many of the students here that have English as their second language.","The partners at Eastside Rehearsal are Meg and Tony Aguilar, and Eddie Rivas.

They've taken out a loan of another $20,000 on their house, and had their friend Eddie Rivas contribute another $20,000 to finish the project. We are in the midst of building out the warehouse space now and hope to be open in October. The $100,000 grant would help secure the equipment needed and ensure that the business would be up and running with out going further in to debt.

Whether a park/field/parking lot/gymnasium/etc. we'll set up a vast array of athletically inspired play equipment and encourage everyone to be physically active, have fun, make new friends and build a bigger community network. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, “communities with … safe places to play are healthier than those that don't.” The pLAy Bus will allow communities to gather together to play and experience their public space like never before. At each stop of the pLAy Bus we’ll also have partners with health services (Vision to Learn, community health organizations, etc.) to provide free health screenings and work with community organizations (Rotary Clubs, Whole Foods, Etc.) to provide additional support and services.","We have targeted two main challenges. The first is our desire to not have a large environmental impact due to pLAy Bus emissions. We want to ensure we leave every area we play in a healthy position than before we left. Therefore, our aim is to convert the bus’ engine to a biofuel engine. Vehicles that run on biodiesel achieve 30% fuel economy than petroleum based diesel engines. Our other challenge we’ve identified would be how to best spread the word about where and when the pLAy Bus will be in a community’s area and encourage participation. In order to overcome this we will start a strong social media campaign, reach out to local news and media organizations and work with community groups, recreation departments, schools and other local social services outlets to have them make the community aware.","Although there is no measure for the smiles and laughs that will be had by the participants, we plan on asking participants to take a survey before leaving. Our questions will be based around our primary objectives:
 •What were your favorite games/activities?
 •How long did you stay and play?
 Did you interact with people outside of the group you can with?
 •Had you been to this particular space before (park, school, community center)?
 •Do you plan on returning now that you been to this space?
 •Did you enjoy the activities provided by the Play Bus?
 •Would you return to a Play Bus event?
 •What was your favorite part of the day?
 
 Finally, we will collaborate with community/area/district/town official government offices & health initiatives along with the UCLA Center for World Health to help figure out what activities/services/organizations the community would love to implement. We'll conduct this research: Pre Event, Time of Event and Post Event.","Our proposal is totally unique. Knucklebones started in Boston in 2007, providing programs to thousands of participants throughout New England. We know how much fun, engagement and social outreach this Play Bus can accomplish. This approach will encourage people who might not have used the public spaces before to visit for the first time and fall in love as well as meet new people in the area and get active – all in one event! After Knucklebones expansion to L.A. in early 2015 we realized that a pLAy Bus can be successfully undertaken and accepted as a unique alternative to being sedentary.","Follows are our partners and how much they will receive from the awarded grant:

 Instead of ice plant, these areas can be used for growing fruits and vegetables for consumption by the populace, for sale to area restaurants, or as biomass. Proceeds from these sales can be used to pay for the upkeep, maintenance, and administration of the plots. A secondary use may be to incorporate medicinal gardens that highlight the indigenous plants and uses by the multitude of traditional cultures that make up the diverse population of Los Angeles.
 
 Imagine the experience of watching the organic growth process as you commute on a freeway - weaving utility and beauty, infrastructure and landscape. By adaptive reuse of the peri-freeway spaces into green infrastructure this project will weave neighbourhoods together and inspire residents by making visible the dynamic process of agriculture inside the county.","One of the challenges will be to encourage collaboration between civic and various government agencies.

5102121,Freight Underground in MYLA2050,2016093,,,"GRID proposes a Demand-Risk Public Private Partnership whereby private investment replaces traditional tax-payer backed securities to build large scale transportation infrastructure. We connect port containers with inland freight distribution hubs comprising of a 3-pronged systems platform; 1)SuperDock, a new platform to load and unload container ships, 2)Freight Pipeline; an underground container shuttle under existing freeways connecting four counties, and 3)last mile truck feeder terminals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The La Kretz Innovation Campus 411 S. Hewitt St. LA, CA 90013",Create,"GRID's mission is to handle future anticipated increases in freight volume while simultaneously reducing our carbon and traffic footprints. How? First, by linking clean large scale infrastructure to sustainable job growth; by-products, particularly healthcare provided by gainful employment brings great benefit our targeted communities. Jobs creation has a direct impact to quality of life in community households to include quality healthcare. The ability to provide healthy foods and regular healthcare checkups are more common practice in homes with higher incomes. 15% of all highway traffic deaths involve big rig trucks. By sending freight underground, we create a safer driving environment for commuters to use our extensive freeway networks with a reduced risk of accidents. Trucks have a 10 to 1 traffic congestion impact on freeway gridlock. The reduction of freight frees up congestion having two tremendous impacts on millions of people both driving on freeways and those living within one mile of them. The reduced congestion reduces time driving. The average LA County commuter spends nearly 24 hours a month in their cars commuting. Stresses associate with commuting are a genuine factor of life here in Southern California. Air pollution including particulate matter from rubber tires and brakes along with emissions create the worst air quality for those living along traffic corridors. Particularly impacted are those under-represented communities that exist along freight corridor freeway networks. Freeways where most freight travels to and from our port complexes and into the south, southeast and eastern regions of Los Angeles are most heavily. The impacts are felt even worse as the freight travels east to the Inland Empire where again, under represented communities are most effected with dirty air and unbearable freeway congestion. This is the first comprehensive solution with the ambition and vision to improve the quality of life for millions of people living and commuting in the region. Los Angeles is the ideal city to lead this effort. An effort that impacts all commuters using bikes, trains, cars, and walking to get where they need to go each and every day. Without clean air, these means of transportation will continue to be an unhealthy factor to our daily activities, even those thought to be healthy!","COLLABORATION among stakeholders. Many times, people refer to organizations as silos and thus the term silo mentality. For example, port authorities are focused on port infrastructure and have no influence on where freight goes once it leaves the port infrastructure. Municipal transportation authorities are focused on road and rail for commuters and freight becomes a burdensome ""freeload"" to the cost road infrastructure as it shares roads with cars. There are council's of governments that focus on their specific regions, politicians who serve local constituents (as they should). The solution to future transportation is not in the hands of this proposer, it is in the hands of decision makers who must break down silos both public and private in nature. The overcoming strategy is ultimately in the hands of the people. Grassroots support from those who become aware that new ideas to improve transportation are out there. Programs like MYLA2050 are an ideal portal to create awareness.","GRID is an infrastructure project proposal. The first step is to evaluate the project. An example is to perform a project feasibility study, an environmental impact report, simulations and scoping. Once the data is collected, stakeholders will determine if the innovations are worthy of development. If so, outreach to the communities the infrastructure is mainly constructed will be an important and early ""evaluating body"" in the process. These studies will come with specific milestones to measure the increasing or decreasing feasibility of the projects. Evaluation is best described as a public private partnership decision. The public sector will provide entitlement as the project meets or exceeds milestones. The private sector will be evaluating other factors like build-ability and profitability. It is our mission to connect with champions who will lead this effort. They will come from communities of business, labor, environment, elected leaders, and everyday people.","No other organization we know of has ever taken this approach. GRID takes two fundamental problems; port congestion created by next generation ultra-large container ships and freeway traffic congestion brought on by semi trucks and trains travelling to and from ports and distribution warehousing, and applies a comprehensive freight supply chain solution bringing 21st Century transportation to the table. GRID co-founders are a duo of underground pipeline development and port operations to create a scale-able and seamless transportation system that is as benign as possible to the communities currently impacted negatively by a fifty year old system of intermodal transportation. We had the foresight of five years to build a startup company dedicated to new cleantech infrastructure and established proprietary rights five years ago to create the most successful cleantech company in California's history with international application potential. Port cities around the world could benefit from this truly Los Angeles born and raises startup. During our journey, we've come to discover that the success or failure of our endeavor rests in the hands of the regions stakeholders who are impacted by urban transportation. We've identified them as public and private entities who all have priorities to achieve in their own right. Our approach is to bring all stakeholders perceived to be either small or large to the table. Our platform comprises of job creation, improved environmental conditions, transportation, and our ability to compete in the worldwide arena of global trade. However, there are an abundance of complementary players who will be vital in our mission. Zero emission truck, rail, and container moving platform manufacturers are one example. Energy providers building new alternative energy infrastructure to make our fully electric platforms zero or near zero emissions capable. Private sector financing to replace tax-payer funded transportation infrastructure is among the most important unique solutions that decision makers and stakeholders must embrace for our proposals to become implemented for this opportunity to become realized.","GRID Is a Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator portfolio company and will have the critical resource of building our startup vision at the $40M LaKretz Innovation Campus. Here, we will have a hub of support in the form of networks, financing, engineering, design, and project development. 50% of the grant will go to human resources who will work on the project as we have been a pre-revenue company for nearly 5 years. Sustaining startup human resources is the most challenging aspect to startups who are bringing genuine game-changing innovation to major markets. The remaining half will go primarily to operational expenses and consultant partners to include business and project development (computer design), legal, and costs to participate in events that will bring networking and trade connections.","$100,000 dollars was the first infusion to Google Inc.

This award represents a bridge to funding this startup as we have already begun talks with potential strategic partners and venture capitalists who will bring the next round of investment capital to build the company. The award from MYLA2050 will buy our startup time and energy to create a stellar team of interns and project supporter in a way that every small startup must experience. Without seed funding, new startups could not exist. To summarize, the $100,000 serves as a bridge to acquire series A funding. The award itself would trigger a tremendous milestone to attracting venture capital from all over the world.

This award will bolster our ability to gain acceptance of the new Office of Extraordinary Innovation created by LAMTA and just opened on October 5th as we will apply as a project participant. In July Governor Brown issued executive order B-32-15 to create pilot projects ""to ensure progress towards a sustainable freight system, these entities initiate work this year on corridor-level freight pilot projects within the State's primary trade corridors that integrate advanced technologies, alternative fuels, freight and fuel infrastructure, and local economic development opportunities."" Please see the executive order at https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19046
 This executive order seeks widespread collaboration to achieve a sustainable freight transportation system. The MYLA2050 award will sustain our companies efforts to connect with the state, federal, regional, and local stakeholders to move this proposal forward. We intend to scale the proposal by engaging with private firms interested in investing in our transportation infrastructure, however, we must collaborate with local stakeholders first to ensure that the project is in demand from communities near the freight supply chain. We seek support from both public and private interests to engage with these ""grassroots"" and under represented constituencies. The ultimate success of failure of this project lies within our ability to evaluate the project for feasibility. This is what the core mission is of the proposers and the MYLA2050 award is a means to start the process."

The prototype ""seed"" project is at Harvard-Westlake High School in the San Fernando Valley, and grows with other schools near 51 miles of river",ALL,"""From the Mountains to the Sea"" will be a program to produce, cultivate and sustain beautiful and healthy interactive civic spaces along the 51 mile long LA RIver. ""From the Mountains to the Sea"" will also be the theme for the network of ""civic art gardens"" sponsored by schools within walking distance of the river. The first art garden will be hosted with Harvard-Westlake School where Coldwater Canyon meets the LA River.
 
 This program will serve students from pre through grad school, related stakeholders and extended communities. These sites will catalyze a multitude of opportunities for everyone to engage, educate, create, perform, gather, gaze and play. 
 
 ""From the Mountains to the Sea"" civic art gardens will also focus attention on water issues through thematic public art and drought tolerant gardens. The program for each site includes a graffiti proof tile floor and wall that make up the “outdoor classroom, performance, meeting” space. Our first site will feature the stunning art work of world renown artist Damian Elwes, who is also a parent at the first school. Damian lived in the mountains of Columbia where he painted the life size imagery from a cloud forest source of the Amazon which will be reprinted on 1’x1’ graffiti proof tiles to make 20’x20’ floor. The wall will be from his 20’ x 8’ depiction of a life size coral reef made of these tiles on a curved modular surface. Connecting the two will be a drought tolerant garden of native plants, reminiscent of the same plants seen 
 in both the mountains and the sea paintings, illustrating the “story of water” from the mountains to the sea, including how plants relate to water. 
 
 The sites will be inspiring, safe, lovely places to be alone with oneself, visit with friends, study with classes, greet neighbors, or feel like a tourist. They will provide curated opportunities to meet others with shared interests, have fun, develop communities, and enjoy beautiful outdoor experiences and environments. 
 
 Inaugural celebrations and thematic festivals will grow communities, connect potential projects with potential patrons, and be civic scale opportunities for people of all ages to play in beautiful spaces activated with vitality that might otherwise stay empty. 
 
 ""From the Mountains to the Sea"" Civic Art Gardens, seeded by LA2050, can start growing right now and help make LA the best place to connect, live, create, learn and PLAY together!","Aligning public and private bureaucracy, community support and creative talent can present challenges. Aligning the resources necessary to realize the vision is challenging as well. There are many groups doing great work although few coordinate and communicate with one another even though their missions and visions may align. Our group, Unycyn Civic Arts, is founded upon the idea of bringing visions together. 
 
 We believe focusing on aligning missions and visions of individuals, the groups they represent and their networks, will provide a ""win-win” holistic experience for those involved and facilitate the flow of resources and attention to civic scale opportunities.
 
 One way to avoid obstacles is to try and recognize their negative potential early enough to redirect the flow of effort to keep moving forward in accordance with mission, vision and goals.","We aim to help transform public places into beautiful and healthy civic spaces in a sustainable way.
 
 We propose to complete a prototype art garden along the river and create a replicable program for other communities to produce civic art gardens.
 
 We plan to meet our fundraising goals to build this project and program by growing tools we've created including flowproject.la, an online platform to match patrons with projects and Unycyn Civic Arts, a non-profit patron support group. 
 
 We will create a timeline for the process which includes contacting schools and partners, curating projects, aligning resources, installing inaugural art garden, and hosting a celebratory civic arts festival “funraiser”.","Many groups are working on making healthy and beautiful civic spaces along the river, at schools, and beyond. They serve as models for elements of our work. These groups: patronize edible gardens at schools, crowdfund support for creative and educational projects, organize professionals and volunteers to improve and maintain public spaces along the river, programming arts and events in public spaces along the river, align public policy and permissions for projects along the river and endeavor to bring joy to public spaces.
 
 We are focusing on producing healthy and beautiful civic spaces with public art and urban gardens hosted by schools adjacent to the river and connected with their surrounding communities and establish a program to support arts, education, design, environment and community. 
 
 Our approach is unique because it identifies, coordinates and synthesizes opportunities to leverage work others are already doing to transform public open spaces into beautiful and healthy civic places. We provide opportunities to align missions and visions of individuals and groups to coordinate and produce results at the civic scale. We identify opportunities in all categories that help make LA a better place now and in 2050:
 
 CONNECT - opportunities for students, parents, teachers, neighborhoods and neighboring communities to gather and engage in the arts 
 CREATE - opportunities for artists and patrons to make and foster beautiful civic spaces
 LEARN - opportunities to work with artists, engage in civic design process and program outdoor classrooms and community spaces
 LIVE - opportunities to cultivate and grow beautiful and healthy civic spaces along the LA River connecting 51 miles of watershed neighbors along a river from the mountains to the sea
 PLAY - opportunities for interactive play places surround by nature, art and gardens","Schools within walking distance to the river, government entities, LARRC, LACMA, patrons, parents, community businesses, corporate design sponsors, artists, scientists, Village Gardeners, Heal the Bay, Learning Gardens, LA Urban Farms, P.S. Arts, DCA and many more groups have agreed and/or will be contacted asap to partner based on the alignment of their missions with ours. The opportunity is to coordinate work they might be doing separately within a united program and vision. Partners will not be receiving money from the initial grant.

Money for this will be raised by selling selected tiles of the artwork, patron donations, and crowdsourcing platforms, online auctions, merchandise related to the projects and foundations whose missions align with our vision, as well as parent and community sponsored events. We will document this process to provide a program for other host schools, along with coordinating opportunities and resources to develop civic art gardens along the river near their schools.
 
 We've also developed technology tools to help support projects like ours: flowproject.la, a crowdsourcing website matching projects with patron gifts of time, talent, resources and treasure, and it's offshoot thecurrent, an enewsletter, connect participants and patrons with projects, news and events.

5102233,Front Line Leaders Academy - Los Angeles Pilot Program,2016169,,,"Building on the success of the first of a two-year pilot, we’ll recruit a second group of young people from LA County – those underrepresented in local public leadership, such as young women, young people of color, and LGBTQ youth – and train them using the Front Line Leaders Academy’s leadership development model to take on greater civic participation roles. We’ll also provide support to the first cohort of young leaders trained last year as they continue community service.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Front Line Leaders Academy – Los Angeles (FLLA-LA) will train 20 young leaders dedicated to creating lasting change in their communities throughout Los Angeles County. FLLA-LA covers a wide range of civic participation leadership skills: how to be an effective campaign manager, finance director, communications director, field organizer, and even candidate. FLLA-LA equips young people with the skills and confidence to become effective leaders, and prepares them to work on a campaign in any capacity as well as to assume key roles in non-profits, local government, and community leadership. In the application and selection process, we look for applicants who are committed and have the potential to create change in their communities – now and over the long-term.
 
 Participants in the inaugural 2014 FLLA-LA are making strides toward many CONNECT metrics outlined in LA2050. Fellows return to their communities with the ability to increase participation in neighborhood councils through traditional organizing; one FLLA-LA alumni hosted a community event focused on uplifting the concerns of men and boys of color. Fellows also return with an ability to impact government’s responsiveness to citizen needs; an FLLA-LA graduate organized a meeting with the Mayor of Los Angeles to discuss concerns of his neighborhood and community members. Another FLLA-LA graduate interviewed Los Angeles city officials on the “digital divide” and discussed the unequal access to technology among Angelinos. Fellows also work toward improving rates of volunteerism and community involvement; an FLLA-LA graduate facilitated a conference to 140 low-income and first-generation high school students encouraging civic participation. Another graduate facilitated a “Chicano Youth Leadership Conference” to 140-low-income and first-generation high school students on the topic of civic participation.","PFAW Foundation traditionally focuses on national youth leadership development programs. Thus, a primary challenge is recruiting for and within the specific community of Los Angeles. To overcome this, we have worked since 2014 building partnerships with like-minded organizations and individuals in LA County in our effort to recruit and identify the most promising young leaders for FLLA-LA. We are already benefiting from partnerships in tangible ways: we received over 60 applications this year from young people who were referred to us by a partner organization, young elected official, or FLLA alumnus. We are especially seeking to recruit people traditionally marginalized from the political process and underrepresented in public leadership, including young women, young people of color, and LGBTQ youth. Through partnerships, we will not only train a class of young leaders, but we will also bring resources, support, and connections to these leaders beyond their eight-month fellowship.","-Recruit a group of 15-20 diverse young leaders from Los Angeles County – with an emphasis on youth traditionally marginalized from the political process and underrepresented in public leadership, including young women, young people of color, and LGBTQ youth on people of color and women – to participate in the second pilot local Front Line Leaders Academy.
 
 -Train the 15-20 young Los Angeles-based leaders in the areas of candidacy, management, finance, communications, and field which will culminate in their developing a mock individual, district-specific “campaign” plan.
 
 -Cultivate relationships with Los Angeles based partner organizations and recruit and train members of the Young Elected Officials Network to facilitate FLLA in-person trainings and ongoing opportunities to build relationships and skills outside the formal training space.","Unlike other similar training programs that provide instruction over the course of one weekend, Front Line Leaders Academy (FLLA) commits to an intensive training, over the course of six months. The training takes place during four in-person weekends using a retreat-style format. Training done in this style with a small group gives FLLA participants – whether they all come from the same geographical region or reflect a national scope – an opportunity to form bonds with other like-minded emerging leaders and to develop a built-in network of other progressive leaders, key factors carrying out successful social justice work. With the FLLA-Los Angeles pilot, in particular, participants are able to establish and build a network of knowledgeable young progressive leaders who live and work in the same community. 
 
 The curriculum of FLLA’s six-month training emphasizes a broad range of competencies required for young leaders to assume key roles in campaigns or nonprofits, or as candidates. The “candidacy” training (what it means to be a candidate) helps fellows to connect their personal stories to their long-term goals, as they consider whether they would run for an elected office or contribute toward developing other leaders within their communities. Preparing a field campaign, another critical area, emphasizes developing a comprehensive understanding about what running in a campaign entails, the importance of voter contact, data management, recurring and retaining volunteers, and educating and mobilizing volunteers. On the finance side, fellows explore the various aspects of creating a financial plan for a campaign and how to identify potential donors. Examining the nuts and bolts of developing a communications plan is the fourth key area. The final focus area is campaign management, where fellows learn best practices on how to manage people and projects. 
 
 All FLLA participants are required to complete an individual mock “campaign” plan, and in the case of the LA fellows, their plan is district-specific. This plan is one of the most tangible outcomes of Front Line Leaders Academy and it is based on assignments completed by fellows throughout the Academy, through which they apply the skills gained through the weekend trainings. After completing each training weekend, fellows turn in parts of their campaign plan based on a potential campaign they plan to staff or on a theoretical race for elected office.","The LA County-based organizations among which we are establishing and cultivating relationships include: Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, Hispanics Organized for Political Equality, Community Coalition, Bend the Arc, NationBuild, California Emerge, New Leaders Council, Greenlining Institute, San Gabriel Valley Mountains Forever Leadership Academy, LAANE, Advancement Project California, California Forward, Drug Policy Alliance, Southern California Latino Policy Institute, Los Angeles African American Women’s Public Policy Institute, and Wilderness Society. We also have identified approximately eight young elected leaders, some of whom are members of PFAW Foundation’s Youth Elected Officials Network and who hold various offices within the county, to assist with recruitment and to serve as mentors and/or trainings and speakers during the eight-month training. These partnerships are informal and these organizations will give of their time and resources on a volunteer basis.","This project consists of two components: 1) recruiting and training 20 young leaders from Los Angeles County for the 2015 FLLA-LA class and 2) offering enhanced alumni programming for the graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class. Estimated costs for recruiting and training the 2015 FLLA-LA class, the first part of this project, are $160,000. This budget includes staff support; travel, meals and lodging for the 20 participants, trainers and staff; consulting fees for trainers; and printing and production of training materials. Several funders have already committed their support for this part of the project including Annenberg Foundation ($50,000), California Community Foundation ($25,000) and McGrath Abrams Foundation $10,000); and we are continuing to identify potential funders to cover the remaining costs. The estimated costs for our project’s second part, providing support to graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class, are $118,000. This budget includes additional training; travel, meals and lodging for the FLLA grads, trainers and staff; consulting fees for trainers; and printing and production of training materials. We are currently identifying potential funders for this phase of the project.","If granted $100,000 through LA2050, we will use $75,000 toward recruiting and training the 2015 class of FLLA-LA class and $25,000 toward supporting graduates of the 2014 FLLA-LA class.","While there are no formal plans to scale the success of FLLA-LA, the program itself provides a natural scaling effect due to the long-term effects of investing in leadership development and the work these leaders will undertake for years to come. It is our hope that FLLA-LA graduates will remain in Los Angeles and will build upon their successes toward improving interconnectedness in the Los Angeles community. These young leaders will pursue issue advocacy work, electoral advocacy work, and neighborhood- and community-based coalition building toward creating fundamental changes in the community. More important than the initial returns from the program is the capacity these young leaders now have to advocate for change in the long-term with the varied skills acquired from the FLLA-LA program.
 
 Since its inception in 2006, FLLA has launched the careers of 136 young leaders: 73 percent of FLLA graduates have gone on to hold leadership roles in nonprofits and community groups; 65 percent have increased civic participation through work on issue-based or electoral campaigns; and 20 percent have subsequently run for local elected office (59 percent of these won their races). The skills attained during the FLLA-LA will allow these young leaders to ascend to positions of influence in the community, thus allowing them to work to improve the community from within. An investment in FLLA-LA is an investment in developing local leaders in the Los Angeles community who desire to create change from within. FLLA graduates possess versatile skill sets that enable them to work in varied ways toward improving the community. Furthermore, the graduates apply these skills in their work well beyond their final moments of instruction – graduation from FLLA-LA marks the beginning of a career’s worth of civic engagement work and community enrichment."
5102108,Fruit Change,2015070,,,"Fruit Change aims to connect neighbors who have fruit trees with neighbors who want the fruit, subsequently fostering connections between neighbors across age, class, ethnic and geographic borders that may otherwise never happen. Those with trees will be able to trade with their neighbors, thus eliminating the waste of excess fruit. Those without trees can trade in sweat equity by picking, sorting, preserving and delivering fruit with their neighbors.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"San Pedro, CA",Learn,"The food growing in yards should connect us. If you've got fruit literally growing on trees, it should be very easy to share it with your community. Fruit Change aims to put a system in place to ensure neighbors connect with each other, so home grown food doesn’t go to waste when someone nearby could be eating it. Fruit Change aims to solve four problems with the current fruit tree situation in San Pedro.
 1: Trees often produce more fruit than the owner can consume, or even pick, so the fruit falls to the ground and rots. This attracts bugs and rodents, can stain the sidewalk and cause slipping hazards. Harvesting is a time consuming, labor intensive process. Not everyone who has a fruit tree has the time or capability to harvest it, but someone nearby does. Fruit Change will connect people who want to pick fruit with those who need someone to pick it. For example, say the owner of a lemon tree must leave town unexpectedly just as a good crop is ripening. At the same time, some kids in the neighborhood are trying to start a lemonade stand. These neighbors need to connect, and Fruit Change will make it possible by digital and face to face methods. The tree owner can make his need made public through the fruit change website or app. The kids can call or visit Fruit Change headquarters with their request for lemons. Fruit Change will connect the two. The tree owner won’t come home to a yard full of rotting lemons, and the kids will get to pick fresh, free lemons for the lemonade stand. The fruit on a tree has the ability start a mutually beneficial relationship between neighbors who otherwise may have never met.
 2: Very few people need large amounts of one type of fruit at a time, which is what a tree produces. Say six neighbors each have one tree that produces a different fruit. With Fruit Change, these neighbors can connect and trade. They’ve all eliminated a portion of their grocery bill, know exactly where this food came from, and handed off food they don’t need.
 3:People without fruit trees have no easy way of obtaining produce grown in the neighborhood. Fruit Change is at heart a barter system. If you don’t have fruit to trade, you can still bring home that mixed bag of local fruit by offering up something else. Neighbors can volunteer for pickup, delivery, sorting, etc and receive fruit for their labor.
 4: San Pedro corner markets don't sell food from the block. Fruit Change aims to empower Cottage Kitchen producers and change this.","The first challenge is data collection. Fruit Change will create metrics for each address including but not limited to: amount and size of producing trees, owner capability and capacity to contribute, and growing season. This will be done by grid method by a core group.
 Next, neighbors need to be able to reach out directly to neighbors who can fulfill their needs and vis versa. We will need to organize the data collected into a user friendly interface. The information needs to be available online, by app, at a storefront, and through a local phone line for neighbors who do not have smart phones or internet access.
 A third challenge is participation. Currently, there is interest from neighbors as well as store owners. We will set and meet accelerating membership goals, so if and when the grant kicks in, we are already organized. The biggest financial challenge is obtaining necessary certifications like gleaner, backyard grower, cottage kitchen. This grant means we could get them sooner.","Membership will be measured not only in size, but in connections. For example, if two people connect and grow a relationship that would have never existed without Fruit Change, we will be able to track that, and even qualify the connections (picker/tree owner, canning worker/Cottage Kitchen owner).
 
 All fruit and food products will be counted, each source and destination noted. We will be able to quantify the program’s success by tracking the life of each piece of fruit and how many connections between neighbors it makes. On the membership level, this data can be used to connect directly. For example, if someone needs to make a lot of guacamole, they can contact a grower by looking up the source of a Fruit Change avocado.
 
 We will produce maps that show how much each fruit tree connected the neighbors around it with one season's yield. The maps will enable neighbors to see how much they have helped each other, while connecting the neighborhood data collectors and artists who make them.","I've found three organizations with similar ideas, but none operates in San Pedro and they all have different philosophies.
 
 The first is Fallen Fruit. fallenfruit.org Their primary goal is art. My primary goal for Fruit Change is a central system to ensure all naturally growing fruit goes to someone who wants it. However, I intend to approach the founders, David Burns and Austin Young, for advice on mapping fruit trees and collaboration in community events. Their spirit and intent are in line with Fruit Change, and I intend to support their projects individually and through Fruit Change.
 
 Food Forward foodforward.org is another organization that gleans excess fruit. They are a huge organization, powered by loyal volunteers, and they donate thousands of pounds of fresh produce to organizations that feed hungry people. Food Forward is an inspiration to Fruit Change because it shows that this model can work on a very large scale. However, Food Forward is strictly volunteers gleaning fruit for charity. Fruit Change isn’t about charity. It’s about sharing and community. Members connect, give what they can, take what they need, and together build a system for making the fruit of a few available to the whole community.
 
 The Hillside Produce Cooperative hillsideproducecooperative.org started by Hynden Walch in Glassell Park, is an excellent example of fruit trading at a grass roots level. The model has been proven effective in several different neighborhoods. Once a month Hynden sends out an email calling for her neighbors to drop off whatever fruit or vegetables they have grown. She then takes one day out of the month to divide and redistribute this fruit with whatever volunteers she can get for help. Fruit Change will be started with this model, and as it grows and we collect data, we can determine the best way for neighbors to connect and help each other pick, deliver and distribute. Rather than once a month, trading and picking will be regularly scheduled events where neighbors can participate based on individual capability and availability. Fruit Change hopes to host Walch and other cooperative coordinators in order to learn and collaborate.","At this time, there are no plans to partner with outside organizations, but as research continues this may change.","Fruit Change is a barter system and can become operational on a small scale like the Hillside Produce Cooperative for zero dollars. With every extra bit of money we only expand our options for growth. With a $100,000 I believe we can accomplish the goals laid out in this grant application.","Projected budget for 1 year:

It’s an amazing place where industry operates at a world class level, yet hand made tamales are still sold door to door out of a rolling cooler. It’s where I’ve always wanted to buy a house, and I finally did this summer. With the house came lemons, kumquats and guavas: lots of them. Those trees are our key to the city. It's the perfect place to connect a diverse group through the one thing we all have in common: everybody eats. 
 
 Fruit Change was founded with the belief that there's no better way to connect with the people around you than by sharing the land's bounty. This project isn’t trying to change San Pedro, or favor one group’s vision of progress over another. Fruit Change is about taking a good hard look at what we’ve got already. We need to talk to each other, figure out who’s got what, what everyone can do to help, and make the best of this great situation we’re in. 
 
 To become financially sustainable, there are currently plans to sell fruit and preserves to local markets and directly to the public, but as Fruit Change evolves we will keep an eye out for, and adapt to, opportunity. A lot of construction on the waterfront will happen in San Pedro over the next few years, meaning teams of workers will be looking to eat quick and nutritious meals on the job. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. Mayor Garcetti has tapped Gaffey for his Great Streets Initiative. There's opportunity for Fruit Change there. 
 
 If Fruit Change is a success, there's no reason it can't happen in every neighborhood in LA. Fruit Change could include communities all over the city, making it a part of the sharing economy as common as Uber or AirB&B.
 
 As we near the end of the initial $100,000 grant, we will rely on the revenue systems we’ve built and grown to continue to fund the program.

5102150,Game Changing Marketplace to Source Hourly Jobseekers,2015097,,,"Our mission at JobCouch is not only to help match jobseekers with hourly job listings but also connect them with local job training programs. By partnering with LA non-profits, government (Workforce Investment Board) & community organizations, our goal is to close the talent-divide between employers and jobseekers (young adults (16-24), formerly incarcerated individuals & immigrants). We're not just focused on hourly jobs, but to help LA residents discover a career & opportunities to succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"LA is a city of opportunity. From minority-owned small businesses, corporate retail & restaurant chains, to warehouses, jobseekers have access to thousands of hourly jobs. Not only are these local businesses a source of income for jobseekers, but a stepping stone to a better future.
 
 With Mayor Garcetti's current agenda to strengthen L.A.'s economy, LA is the best place for JobCouch to collaborate with city leaders to improve the process of discovering hourly jobs & career opportunities. Currently, city council members Mayor Eric Garcetti, Supervisors Don Knabe, Hilda Solis, Sheila Kuehl, Mark Ridley-Thomas, and Councilmember Gil Cedillo, have all been strong advocates of HIRE L.A.'s Youth program which provides career exploration opportunities to low-income youth between the ages of 14 and 24. This is only one of several running programs in LA that is helping bridge the gap of employment for young adults.
 
 In addition to the collaboration with city leaders, potential partnership opportunities with the L.A. Opportunity Youth Collaborative, LAUSD, the Alliance for Children’s Rights, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, Youth Workforce Development System in the City and County of Los Angeles, and other organizations will allow JobCouch to narrow the gap of unemployed youth.
 
 Not only are we targeting young adults in discovering opportunities to succeed, we're also targeting immigrants. According to the 2008-2010 American Community Survey, more than one-third of residents in Los Angeles County are immigrants (More than 3.4 million immigrant residents in the County). Immigrants comprise nearly half of the labor force in Los Angeles County (45%). Our goal is to help the immigrant residents (citizens) in Los Angeles County discover hourly jobs and access to job training programs to help advance their careers.
 
 Lastly, in Los Angeles, 1 in 4 has an arrest or conviction record. We will work with Center for Employment Opportunities, LA county Parole Divisions, and other Re-Entry councils to help guide jobseekers with criminal records get back on their feet with a hourly job or connect them with a job training program to help start a career.","One major challenge I anticipate is signing up employers that can hire jobseekers with criminal records. Although California has adopted the ban-the-box policy (laws to ban the prior-conviction box on job applications), many businesses still run criminal background checks on potential employees.
 
 Fortunately, there are many fast casual restaurants and warehouses that accept applicants regardless of criminal background history. We've worked with several businesses in SF where we've placed formerly incarcerated jobseekers into employment. Potential partnerships with the Center for Employment Opportunities & Parole Divisions will help us identify which businesses in LA hire jobseekers with a criminal record.
 
 We're are also fortunate to have an advisor with over 20 years of experience working with formerly incarcerated individuals to guide us on job placement.","JobCouch will evaluate the success of our work by measuring the following factors:
 
 1) Partner with 24 non-profit organizations to narrow the gap of unemployed young adults, immigrants, and jobseekers with criminal records.
 
 2) Sign up 10,000 active jobseekers (young adults, immigrants, & jobseekers with criminal records)
 
 3) Post 36,000 active hourly job listings 
 
 4) Average of 10% hire rate with employers","Organizations like Leadersup.org is complimentary, and we've discussed the possibility of collaboration with the CEO. Competitors like Workpop.com, Apploi.com, Snagajob.com & Craigslist.org, all help with the search for hourly jobs. 
 
 JobCouch is unique as we're not a job search engine or a job board, but a hourly job matching platform. We're implementing the matching model from dating sites to deliver hourly job listings to jobseekers. Rather than searching for a job, we match jobseekers to job listings posted by an employer. Once the jobseeker applies, and the employer expresses interest, an interview is scheduled. Only job listings that he jobseeker qualifies for (based on profile), will be delivered to their dashboard. Lastly, besides Leadersup.org, we are the only private company to match jobseekers with local job training programs.","We will be working with United Way, Workforce Development Center, Workforce Investment Board, and other organizations. We will also be working with employers like Specialty's Cafe & Bakery, The North Face, Creative Baby Warehouse, and other hourly employers. None of the grant will be going to the partners.","Our projected cost is $250,000 for 2016. We will cover the additional cost from generating revenue from employers. If we are unable to generate revenue, we will seek angel investment.","$30,000 - Outsource development of iOS & Android app
 $12,000 - Community donations to High Schools, and youth centers for brand awareness campaigns
 $36,000 - Office Rent & Supplies
 $22,000 - Social Media Advertisement (Facebook & Twitter Ads) to drive sign ups & brand awareness","With collaboration with city leaders and partnerships with local job training centers & job assistance organizations, we will have distribution channels to help us spread the word of our mission. By partnering with major retail stores, we will be able to expand into multiple store locations to implement JobCouch as their main applicant tracking system. By proving results for the small business community, we will be able to help drive applicants and help deliver quality candidates to stores that have never had a system to track and source new applicants."
5102093,Generation Next: Ready on the SET and Action - Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math,2015058,,,"Generation Next will bring seminars into high school classrooms to build writing skills and a love of writing by teaching screenwriting basics using professional screenwriters. Students in participating classes can submit ideas for movie or TV scripts dealing with scientists, engineers or technologists, and students with winning ideas will be supported by science and creative mentors in writing a full script. Top 2 finished scripts will receive a cash prize at the annual SET Awards Ceremony.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,"Studio City, North Hollywood, Hollywood, W. Los Angeles: schools located near movie and TV studios",Create,"Through an innovative literacy program building on successes showing young people motivated by creative expression through script writing, Entertainment Industries Council (EIC) will address LA2050 Learn goal through the launch of Generation Next in high schools in L.A.
  
 EIC team will adapt its Generation Next college film school program for L.A. high schools. To provide added value, we will bring Writers Guild screenwriters and tech experts into select classrooms to teach about script writing, mentor them on literacy and conversational skills through writing dialog, and through a common theme in the scripts, focus their attention on how exciting science, tech and engineering fields are, and their importance to our daily lives. We will build writing skills while instilling a love of writing movies and TV shows like the ones they watch. There is no better place to be when it comes to screenwriting than L.A.
  
 Students will then be invited to submit ideas for scripts featuring 1 or more key characters who are a scientist, engineer or technologist. A panel of writers and scientists will select at least one submitted project in each class to be developed by that student into a script. Each will be assigned an expert in the field to be portrayed and a professional writer to be a creative mentor through EIC’s relationship with the WGA Foundation. Finished scripts will compete for a cash prize that will be awarded at EIC’s annual SET Awards. The process of creation at the idea submission stage and at the script writing stage will not only nurture writing skills but also encourage an appreciation and love for the science, engineering and tech fields.
  
 Research has shown that the bulk of future job growth will be in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), making it vital that young people develop an excitement and interest in studies and careers in these fields. Unlike other literacy programs, students learn the key area of conversational English through dialog writing. Mentors will encourage students to stretch vocabulary skills and explore new ways to write. By focusing on a scientist, engineer and/or technologist, students will write dialogue for character from different backgrounds (since these will be schools struggling w/ performance), encouraging new language skills.","The major challenge will be getting teachers to agree to allow EIC to conduct the program in their classrooms. There are already many needs and goals competing for class time between core curricula lessons and standardized testing preparations. How does one ensure that this program will be how a teacher chooses to utilize valuable class time? One provides an incentive. In addition to providing the seminar and the opportunity for their students to win a cash prize, each teacher that follows through on conducting the program will receive a $500 gift card that can be used to purchase supplies for their classroom.","Evaluation will include:
 - Tracking the number of students reached in the 10 classrooms in which seminars are conducted.
 - Tracking the number of script idea submissions from those 10 classrooms.
 - Grading the writing ability of participating students based on an existing school paper before the program and based on the script they write during the program, and comparing the grades.
 - Student evaluations conducted by mentors of the students they worked with.
 - Identifying any change in the number of participants planning to go to college before and after the program.
 - Class grade improvements for participating students as reported by teachers.
 - Classroom attitude improvements for participating students as reported by teachers.","There are organizations doing similar work to other EIC activities, but none of them do work similar to the Generation Next program. For example, Hollywood, Health and Society provides tech assistance to entertainment creators through a service patterned after EIC’s First Draft program but are not involved in classroom education. There are many STEM Education initiatives focused on encouraging students to develop science-related projects (robotics teams, science project fairs, etc.), but these do not use script writing to excite and instill interest in these topics. There are other organizations that focus on building literacy and writing skills in the classroom, however they do not use screenwriting as their written form.
 
 EIC is the only organization hailing from the entertainment industry itself that is involved in STEM Education on a substantive, ongoing and long-term basis. Existing EIC activities related to these topic areas include the annual SET Awards to honor TV and movies that have the potential to inspire young people to pursue studies and careers in these fields, and the First Draft technical resource service that provides access to scientists, engineers and technologists for entertainment creators to lend authenticity to their productions. EICnetwork.tv, the organization’s internet outlet, has a Science, Engineering and Technology channel that plays host to videos that promote STEM fields and STEM Education.
 
 Young people experience more movies and TV than books during their formative years. They are therefore more likely to develop a love of writing by writing scripts rather than term papers, short stories or poetry. EIC, through its partnership with the WGA Foundation, is the only organization that already has a program to help teach screenwriting that is readily adaptable, leading to a love of writing.
 
 By adapting EIC’s existing Generation Next program for high school with a focus on the STEM fields, EIC can bring its successful process of teaching writing while using creativity to learn about health and social issues to bear upon STEM Education – an essential if L.A. is to remain competitive in the future economy. EIC will provide a unique program that will help to make Los Angeles both the best place to LEARN, by using professional writers who reside and work in close proximity, and the best place to CREATE because the environment that supports and employs screenwriters is right in our own backyard.","EIC will partner with the WGA Foundation of the Writers Guild of America West. The WGA Foundation will work with EIC to help secure members of the Guild to support the program with volunteer time as judges, classroom speakers and creative mentors, and to promote the program to their members. The Foundation will receive $10,000 to cover its expense of labor and other costs to assist with the program. This will ensure that the screenwriters participating in this educational program are of the highest professional caliber – individuals who bring a wealth of real world experience in their craft to the process.","To conduct the program will require $100,000. This initial investment will go heavily toward labor hours for developing the curriculum and materials, recruiting speakers for classroom seminars, engaging the appropriate school systems and schools to get permission to conduct the program, reaching out to and recruiting teachers to participate, and lining up judges, mentors and experts to participate in the Fellowship aspects of the program. The program will be piloted in 10 classrooms initially.
 
 Other direct costs will include: a seminar leader for the 10 classroom sessions, a subcontract with the WGA Foundation of the Writers Guild of America West to assist with writer volunteer recruitment and promotion, web site updates and materials design, gift cards to participating teachers for the purposes of classroom supplies, cash prizes for the student winner and runner-up, and basic operating costs for the project such as copying/printing, local mileage and parking for meetings and conducting seminars, telephone calls, office supplies, and postage and other deliveries.
 
 After a successful 10-room launch, with materials already developed, EIC will seek out additional funding to replicate the program and expand the number of classrooms in which it is conducted. The cost of conducting the ongoing program once launched will be significantly reduced because it will draw upon volunteer time from STEM field experts and members of the entertainment industry as speakers, judges, technical advisors and creative mentors.","Salaries (Project Director, Project Manager & Administrative Support): $46,850

5102074,Getting LA students to graduate: educating the whole child,2015042,,,"CISLA’s goal is to improve educational outcomes for underserved students at 12 schools in Los Angeles Unified School District, leading to an increase in graduation rates. Through the use of one-on-one case management and school-wide or small group interventions, we will place passionate and trained social service professionals onto school campuses every day to identify the needs – academic and non-academic - of students and offer on-site programs and referrals services that address those needs.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0CreatePlay0,"Transportation in LA is undergoing a sea change, guided by the expansion of public transit, efforts to promote safe walking and bicycling, and the growth of technology enabled bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing. People today can access a bike or car for short-term use or to share a ride with someone heading in the same direction thus splitting the cost. This offers a tremendous opportunity to benefit low income communities because owning a car costs up to $9,000 a year. 
 These resources have the potential to tackle the 1st/last mile gap of public transit, lower the need to purchase a vehicle, and reduce air pollution from vehicles. They could also lower the need to build unnecessary parking spaces, reducing construction costs and increasing the stock of affordable housing. However, figuring out how to tailor these services to low income communities has not received sufficient attention. Given the large number of LA’s neighborhoods that were deemed “disadvantaged communities” by the California Environmental Protection Agency, due in large part to socioeconomic factors and exposure to air pollution, this proposal seeks to create a shared mobility ecosystem model that could guide private and public efforts in this arena.
 CBE will work with Trust South LA, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Shared Use Mobility Center (SUMC) to build on the momentum of recent developments in shared mobility – namely the City of LA’s launch of low income electric carsharing in central LA low income neighborhoods and LA Metro’s launch of bikesharing in Downtown LA. 
 Focusing these programs on the needs of South and Southeast LA – where median incomes are well below the county’s median – can improve residents’ quality of life with affordable on-demand access to cars and bikes, filling in gaps in the transit network and drastically reducing the need to own a car to be able to live and work. We will lead a participatory planning process to identify the range of residents’ transportation needs that could be met through a mix of bikesharing, carsharing, and ridesharing that can leverage the growing public transit network. Their input will be captured through community focus groups in a customized plan, which we will pitch to local government and transportation officials as well as private providers to develop a competitive public-private implementation proposal to state and other funding. This model can be then expanded to more communities in LA.","Disinvestment: These communities have faced a pattern of disinvestment that makes private companies less likely to take risks on their own, and has resulted in physical environments without the mix of land uses and household income levels that are often prerequisites for shared mobility systems. This Plan will proactively address this through creative program startup investments.
 Accessibility: Many of the community members in greatest need of transportation solutions also face the most significant barriers to accessing them, whether barriers of language, physical disability, internet access, or banking. This Plan will address these barriers in the program design using popular education methods to meet the community where it is in terms of language, availability, skills, and resources.
 Design Bias: In addition to accessibility barriers, existing shared mobility systems are tailored to attract above-median income clientele. We will work to create a design that is affordable and useful","During the first 6 months, we will analyze the communities’ socioeconomic characteristics and conduct two focus groups. It is estimated that the focus groups will engage up to 100 residents and stakeholders each to develop an assessment of their transportation needs. The second 6 months will focus on gaining local buy-in from elected and community stakeholders through letters of support and ultimately securing support in 2017 to launch programs. Thus, the first quarter (post grant award) will focus on the analytical work with the focus groups and community engagement taking place in the second quarter. The third and fourth quarters will focus on securing endorsements and funding commitments from local elected and city officials as well as private providers in the bikesharing and carsharing industries. Ultimately, the success of this project will be determined by both the scale at which these programs are deployed and the extent to which the programs are used by low-income residents.","This project is being proposed by many of the organizations involved in the LA City EV carshare project (EV pilot), which will be led by LADOT and SUMC and focuses on Central Los Angeles. NRDC has convened a Steering Committee, of which CBE & TRUST South LA are part, for Phase One of EV pilot, and project partners will translate lessons learned to this Shared Mobility Plan for South and Southeast LA. Although carsharing will only be one aspect of the Plan, the Phase One project will tackle the same disinvestment, accessibility, and design issues.
 Additionally, there are parallel efforts from which we can learn. Specifically, there is an effort in the central valley focused on bringing ridesharing and vanpooling solutions to farmworkers and farmworker communities so that they can get to and from work, clinics, and school. The SUMC project lead has hands on experience managing the Buffalo carshare operation that provided shared cars to low income residents of this upstate New York community. Finally, the LA County Bike Coalition has worked with the cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, and Huntington Park to pursue California Active Transportation funding to develop a south LA county bike masterplan, which will lay the groundwork for bikeshare expansion. Our proposal aligns the best of these projects and planning efforts to develop a shared mobility ecosystem that meets the unique needs of these communities and then pursue a mix of public and private resources to expand these innovative transportation solutions into our communities.","• CBE - $25,000
 • TRUST South LA - $25,000
 • NRDC - $25,000
 • SUMC - $25,000","We believe that urgency and opportunity of this proposal will necessitate an investment of $250,000. However, given the participation of the partners in the LA City’s grant funds for Phase 1, this proposal is able to leverage the resources available for community, public/government engagement and stakeholder engagement to expand the analysis and outreach into South and Southeast LA communities for minimal additional cost. 
 
 All told, an expansion of car and bikesharing systems alone (not to mention ridesourcing and car/vanpooling) could mean anywhere from a $3 – 10 Million initial investment in these communities, and the Shared Mobility Plan would be the first step towards advocating for these investment of these resources in South and Southeast LA. A solid plan that comes from the community will be critical to securing public resources and inducing private investment.","I. Project Management - $13,744

We believe that the focused analysis, scoping, and stakeholder engagement, including with mobility providers, of this Shared Mobility Plan will help channel future resources, should the City of LA (or the cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, or Huntington Park) pursue future grants from the sources described above, to these communities. We believe that this proposal will provide timely analysis to nudge Metro to bring future bikeshare resources to South and Southeast LA. 
 This targeted Shared Mobility Plan could be a prototype for other disadvantaged communities in Southern California, from East LA to Long Beach to Inglewood and parts of the San Fernando Valley. All of these communities deserve to be part of the shift towards affordable shared mobility solutions, and this Plan will be a prototype for how to get there."

In LAUSD, the female population is under served in math, science, technology and the development of a strong independent voice. GALA will seek to address these issues within a single-sex environment and as the first all-girls public school, will serve as a research and development site for effective urban schools and transfer success practice to the larger LAUSD co-educational context. 
 
 Most inner city girls have never used tools to make hand-on projects. A Maker Space at our school will be a collaborative workshop where girls gain practical hands-on experiences with new technologies and innovative processes to design and build projects. A Maker Space can provide a flexible environment where learning is made physical by applying science, technology, math and creativity to solve problems and build things. Who in this group will be the next inventor, problem solver, or technology innovator? Who in this group will figure out answers to solve LA's problems of drought, homelessness, or earthquakes?

5102147,Giving Students Power Over Numbers and Power Over Learning,2015096,,,"Chronic low achievement in math has been a major barrier that has prevented Los Angeles from being considered the best place to learn. Struggling students need an effective math fluency system to build the foundation they need to succeed in higher level math, and teachers need expert training to implement effective math instruction. Ironbox Education will fill both of these needs for multiple schools in Los Angeles County by using a proven math fluency system designed by Dr. Randy Palisoc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Ironbox Education was founded by Dr. Randy Palisoc, a renowned LA educator who is known for making math easy. Dr. Palisoc has been featured as a math education speaker, and a school he founded in South LA was named the #1 Urban Elementary School in America in 2013. It was also the first elementary school in South LA to ever win the National Blue Ribbon Award, which is the highest honor an American public school can earn.
 
 However, even though the elementary school that Dr. Palisoc founded was the first in South LA to ever win such a prestigious award, Dr. Palisoc believes that it shouldn't be the only one. All schools in LA should be great places to learn, not just a few of them.
 
 That's why Dr. Palisoc founded Ironbox Education in 2014 in order to focus on designing math fluency curriculum for schools and providing professional development for teachers. Through Ironbox Education, Dr. Palisoc has taken the lessons that have already made a difference for thousands of students and is now helping other schools in LA and around the country.
 
 Through this grant, Ironbox Education will take this effective math fluency system and will start bringing it to scale throughout Los Angeles, thereby making LA the best place to learn.
 
 When looking at the kindergarten through college pipeline, the foundation for math must be built early in elementary and middle school. Students who struggle in math in high school and who need remedial classes in college are the same ones who never built a strong foundation when they were younger.
 
 Therefore, Ironbox Education will identify middle schools and the elementary schools that feed into them to implement a coordinated math fluency system that will yield long-term benefits. Students will be provided with Ironbox Education's materials, and teachers and parents will be provided with training to develop their expertise in building math fluency.
 
 By building math fluency, which is often overlooked in schools, students will become better problem solvers, which will lead to a rise in Academic Performance Index scores. When students feel more successful and confident, then suspension, expulsion, and truancy rates will go down (Dream Metric). When these students reach high school, their math proficiency will increase, and graduation rates will rise. Those who enter college will better be able to complete their programs on time.
 
 As leverage, the schools in this grant will become models for other schools to replicate.","One barrier is limited school funding. Schools with tight budgets are often in survival mode instead of long-term planning mode. As a result, they may be reluctant to try a new system, even if they have an urgent math fluency need and even if a system exists that addresses that need.
 
 This grant eliminates that financial barrier, giving schools the courage they need to pilot this needed system. Once they see results, they will be able to focus on the benefits of the system, which far outweigh the costs. This will encourage others to do the same.
 
 A second barrier is implementation. Educational researchers have shown that schools get results only when there is deep implementation. To reach deep implementation, schools will sign a commitment agreement. They will commit to providing the following: informational meetings with teachers and parents to get buy in; time for training teachers and parents; time in the daily schedule for students to use the system; ongoing support visits.","Educational researchers explain that assessments are necessary in order to improve instruction and learning. The lessons in this math fluency system build sequentially upon each other, and each lesson serves as an assessment that needs to be successfully completed before going on to the next lesson.
 
 To evaluate ongoing implementation, schools will track classroom-level data on the number of students who successfully complete each lesson and each unit. This will help make sure that the school and its students are progressing on schedule. 
 
 Additionally, pre-tests and post-tests will be given to see how much students have improved academically over time.
 
 To evaluate teacher and parent expertise, surveys will be conducted after in-person trainings are held. Participants will be asked about what they learned and what support they need. 
 
 Statewide and districtwide assessments will also be used to measure academic growth.","There have long been other organizations that have provided classroom materials and teacher training for schools, but too many students in LA continue to struggle specifically with math fluency. As a result, these students struggle with problem solving as well. 
 
 Ironbox Education specifically addresses this need of building greater math fluency in students.
 
 What makes Ironbox Education's math fluency system unique is that it was created not by a publisher, but by an experienced LA educator with a highly-successful track record. This math fluency system was designed by Dr. Randy Palisoc, a founder of a five-time national award winning school in LA. Dr. Palisoc is known for making math easy.
 
 This proposal seeks to help other schools implement proven strategies in order to help them reach high levels of success as well. This unique proposal is about replicating success throughout Los Angeles.
 
 The in-person teacher trainings and parent workshops are unique as well because they will be personally led by Dr. Palisoc, the actual designer of the math fluency system. This means that teachers and parents will learn directly from the designer. 
 
 As a result, teachers and parents will become math fluency experts themselves, and they will better be able to help their students and their children. To provide ongoing support, teachers and parents will have online access to Dr. Palisoc's lesson-by-lesson demo videos, thereby taking the guesswork out of how to deliver a lesson.
 
 Teachers who have already participated in Ironbox Education's professional development have responded enthusiastically. Some of their feedback include the following:
 
 ""Fluency doesn't have to be pulling teeth! I feel privileged that we were trained in this method.""
 
 ""I learned that you don't have to use traditional methods to teach math. You can use the Easy Breezy methods to get all students to be successful in math.""
 
 ""I learned how to model using the Step 1 and Step 3 strategies, which were much more efficient ways to add and subtract. I have been working far too hard!""
 
 ""Mind blown in a good way!""
 
 ""Math isn't a problem. Math is Easy Breezy.""
 
 ""My biggest takeaway is that this is truly a different way of thinking/teaching/learning rather than a variation of the same old thing.""
 
 ""I was robbed growing up! These strategies are helpful to everyday life!""
 
 ""I wish I knew about this when I was learning math. It would have helped me build a strong foundation.""","The schools that will be a part of this project are yet to be identified. However, it is anticipated that at least some of the schools will be in metropolitan Los Angeles. 
 
 Dr. Palisoc started his education career as a classroom teacher in LA, and the award-winning school that he founded is located within the city's boundaries. As a result Dr. Palisoc already has experience partnering with and working with the education community in LA.
 
 The schools in this project will not receive grant funds directly, but they will receive classroom materials, training, and ongoing support paid for by the grant funds.","It will cost $100,000 to provide the classroom materials, training, and ongoing support described in this project.
 
 The project will serve four elementary schools of 500 students each (2,000 elementary school students total) and two middle schools of 1,000 students each (2,000 middle school students total). In all, a total of 4,000 elementary and middle school students will benefit. These figures will be adjusted once the actual partner schools are finalized.
 
 If additional costs are incurred, Ironbox Education will further substantially discount the materials and services so that partner schools can more easily cover the difference that is not paid for by the grant.","$40,000 for classroom materials for four 500-seat elementary schools
 
 $42,000 for classroom materials for two 1,000-seat middle schools
 
 $12,000 for elementary school training and ongoing support
 
 $6,000 for middle school training and ongoing support
 
 GRAND TOTAL = $100,000 to benefit 4,000 students in six schools
 
 More importantly, these six schools will serve as a model for other schools, and they will demonstrate the tremendous value of building math fluency in students.","As mentioned earlier, this proposal is about taking a unique math fluency system that has proven to be successful in Los Angeles and starting to bring it to scale throughout LA, thereby making LA the best place to learn. 
 
 What is most important about this proposal is not just that six lead schools will initially benefit from this grant. The important part is that these six schools will serve as models for building math fluency that many other schools will then feel comfortable following. 
 
 That is the true value of this grant – it creates proof points and raises student expectations for all of Los Angeles.
 
 All the classroom materials, teacher trainings, and parent workshops described in this proposal have already been designed and created, so it is a turnkey solution ready for immediate use.
 
 Once more schools see the value of building math fluency and start to adopt the system, additional staff will be hired to assist with marketing, fulfillment, training, on-campus support, and administrative tasks."

5102065,Graduate thousands of L.A. High School Students with an Awesome Teacher & an Innovative App,2015036,,,Our proposal is to take otherwise non-graduating students and help them graduate by focusing on the fail they received in biology class (often the only obstacle between them and a diploma).,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"It's difficult for any human being to sit in a classroom for six hours a day. They should have to do endure that to graduate from high school; however, by focusing one a huge requirement for high school graduation (passing biology), we can not only make students smarter with the notification and feedback system we've developed to make every student engage socially (but privately) in biology class. By focusing on biology class, we think we can help these kids graduate from high school and change the trajectory of their lives. 
 
 We'll work with who we feel is one of the most accomplished science teachers in the nation who has achieved goals no on would have ever thought possible. Not only does he teach, but it turns out most of his students are teachers too. The 8th Graders teach the sixth graders all the math, science and writing to get every student at a level most people would have a hard time believing. We think his approach and what we discovered in the field are aligned. We think its the magic behind what many consider impossible. We're duplicating this process with our software, and we believe that by giving our tool away to students and teachers that we can begin to truly achieve 100% graduation rates. Of course, we have to gather the data, learn from our mistakes, and work with some of the best programmers (founding CEO of Pandora.com, Jon Kraft, and the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world (stamps.com). We will talk to teachers and students everyday to make sure we're doing it right. Once we get it right a year from now, we'll be able to duplicate our success year after year, and apply what we learned by working with other teachers in other subject areas.","Having taught all over Los Angeles, we know we're going to have to reach out to students who have a lot challenges going on in their lives; however, we think that these very same kids use apps like Instagram and Snapchat because of the notifications and social engagement. Our app has a similar type of engagement, but actually helps the student improve their real life outcomes. Every student wants to be successful, but some would rather just fail than to sit in a classroom. We're offering them a compelling alternative.","We wil evaluate our work by comparing results with students who use our platform to students who use another learning platform. We think LAUSD is probably tackling this problem now on some level. Our Learning Xprize insights surprised even us. This got us pretty excited and even inspired some legends in the tech industry to work with us. We think it could be done in a much more effective way by segmenting the biology content and assessment in a way that is delightfully simple and clear. By working closely with 2-4 high schools and their counseling staff, we will compare the performance of 200-400 students who use our app compared with those who don't.","There are are organization that do similar work, but we haven't been able to find another company that takes the burden from the teacher, and makes every student a teacher. We think it's physically impossible for a teacher to provide all of the feedback and attention a student needs to master a subject. However, a slightly smarter student can help another student in an area where he is slightly smarter, and we realized in our work that kids would rather have kids teaching them than a teacher. It's more fun that way. It's social.","We will be working with Carlos Lauchu
 Jon Kraft, founding CEO of Pandora, and Girish Venkat, the guy who built one of the most secure websites in the world - stamps.com (it's like printing money). We will work with some of the best programmers in the world (Lift Off) to make sure the security and level of programming is world class. This will help us scale to expand our efforts. 
 $75,000 will be spent on programmers working for a highly discounted rate through Lift Off, our technical partner on this project. 
 $25,000 will be spent on servers, UX designers, teacher support inside of classrooms to make sure there's a conduit between the teachers, students, UX designers, engineers, and programmers. 
 
 Except for Carly Saltzman who will be paid approximately $15,000 to work directly with schools and teachers over a year in classrooms, no other partners will be getting paid for this project. 
 
 We think it will add an awesome capability to our Xprize Learning platform.","To create the biology class and a dynamic assessment, it will cost $100,000. We have developed an preliminary interface and a set of questions and lessons with Mr. Lauchu. We discussed it with Girish Venkat, the technical lead on the project, who estimated it would be enough to build a biology class feature into our application.","$75,000 Programming & Engineering Costs
 $15,000 School & Teacher Liaison & Expenses
 $ 5,000 Interface Design
 $ 5,000 Servers, extra support & expenses","Once we succeed with the biology class, we will have built the infrastructure to tackle any other subject on the platform. We can expand to more high schools throughout the city, and make sure graduating from high school is never problematic for any student who just doesn't want to do the seat time. With our team, we think our success will be able to be duplicated at any high school in the United States. We could also expand to other subjects to make it very difficult NOT TO GRADUATE. We realize that graduating all high school students sounds impossible given the amount of effort that has gone into it. We also think that it's really tough to learn the way most kids do today so we understand why some kids would rather just quit. By giving students a tool in the palm of their hands, we think we can scale the success of our proposal well beyond high schools in the city of Los Angeles. At this point, we're excited to take it one step at a time."
5102117,Green Commuter LA2050,2015075,,,"Green Commuter emphasizes sustainability and maximizing the efficiency of the existing transportation network at a human scale. This proposal expands the upcoming launch of our pilot programs offering complete car sharing and vanpooling services using the latest technology and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to facilitate travel across the greater LA area. We offer the most comprehensive program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion, all while reducing commuting costs.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,0Create0Live,"Green Commuter will make LA the best place to connect by offering a tool to help LA residents, commuters, and visitors get from one place to another in an environmentally-friendly, convenient, affordable, and innovative way.
  
 Current vanpool commuters only use their vans between 10 to 15 hours per week (an average of a 1 to 1.5 hour commute each way for five days). With only 6-9% of usage during any point of a given week, the van stays unused for the remaining 91-94% of time. In order to address this deficiency and maximize utilization and efficiency of the vehicles, Green Commuter has developed a new model that will use the vanpool vehicle, when it is not commuting people to and from work, as a public car share vehicle or to replace an employer or municipality’s fleet vehicle. The goal is for the synergy between all systems to dramatically increase the benefits of their stand-alone schemes.
  
 The synergistic model couples zero-emission vehicles with ride sharing and car sharing, offering one of the most comprehensive programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion while simultaneously reducing the commuting costs of its members. Currently, the only vehicle to meet the needs of this innovate model is the all-electric Tesla Model X. A 7-passenger utility vehicle, the Model X offers the essential battery capacity for the long-range driving needed to allow for car sharing, vanpooling, and fleet replacement on a daily basis.
  
 Green Commuter plans to launch in early 2016 and a grant from LA 2050 would help expand our first pilot program in order to reach more people. As an LA2050 report noted, “People live where they do because they want to get a quality education, a good job, an affordable home, and maintain (or build new) social ties. Transportation helps accomplish these goals.” Green Commuter’s goal builds on all these objectives to make sure that transportation is affordable, green, and convenient. In many instances, people have limited access to public transportation and, without a service like Green Commuter, would have no mobility options or otherwise be restricted to the costs associated with using a single vehicle. Therefore, Green Commuter’s innovative strategy will help reduce single occupancy vehicle use in Los Angeles and, in turn, help mitigate traffic and air pollution.","One of Green Commuter’s challenges is to make sure that charging infrastructure is available to support its all-electric fleet. Green Commuter’s system is dependent on accessing charging stations, either at the origin or destination point. Even though there are new charging stations installed on a daily basis, more are needed as ZEVs on the road keep increasing. Current subsidies and legislation are encouraging the installation of charging stations and, as the infrastructure keeps expanding, the issue will disappear.
  
 Green Commuter will continue to work with its partners to navigate important government, utility, and other incentives available towards EV charging stations. Additionally, the full breadth of EV charging options, from different charge levels to leasing or owning stations, will allow Green Commuter and its partner entities to find a solution that fits best with their needs.","Green Commuter’s success will be measured primarily by the deployment of its all-electric, zero-emission fleet, but also by its ability to meet its goals to alleviate traffic, mitigate air pollution, and reduce the cost of commuting.
  
 Vanpooling is the most affordable way to commute and Green Commuter will offer its vanpool services at a monthly cost that is less than what other current vanpool providers charge. Additionally, car sharing also helps improve mobility options, particularly for disadvantaged communities. Every all-electric vanpool avoids, on average, the emission of 39 MTCO2 per year and every car share removes 9-13 vehicles from the road. Therefore, utilization of Green Commuter’s model will quantifiably reduce commuting costs for its riders, help improve air quality, and remove vehicles from the road. Green Commuter will collect and monitor data from each of its vehicles to both evaluate and demonstrates its ongoing impact.","Companies with whom Green Commuter competes are Zipcar, Cars2Go, Enterprise CarShare, vRide, Uber, and Lyft. However, these companies do not offer combined ride sharing and car sharing services like Green Commuter, often requiring members to use multiple services or own a personal vehicle to meet the full range of their travel needs. The integrated car sharing and vanpooling service will give members the convenience of having multiple mobility options within a single service. Further, Green Commuter has a competitive advantage because of its electrified fleet. Electric zero-emission vehicles enable Green Commuter to leverage local, regional, state and federal tax credits and subsidies reducing end-user costs, providing additional revenue, and mitigating risks to investors.
 
 Green Commuter has also created systems, such as custom software solutions and mobile applications, to assure that the vanpool, fleet replacement, and car share systems can work seamlessly in tandem, especially when either origin or destination points are located within the Los Angeles area, therefore offering car sharing services around the clock. Other notable car share providers offer services that are limited by vehicle availability, range (in the case of electric vehicles) and capacity. The Tesla Model X, with its seven-passenger seating and approximate 250-mile range, allows Green Commuter to execute an innovative model unlike existing transportation options - a system that goes beyond conventional vanpool and car share platforms to integrate with current and future transportation initiatives focused on multi-modal travel, regional interconnectivity, and pollution mitigation.","Green Commuter does not have specific partners for this grant and, if awarded, the full grant award amount will go solely to Green Commuter. However, more generally, collaboration is at the center of all of Green Commuter’s work. Green Commuter works closely with non-profit, governmental, university, and for-profit partners to achieve it mission of alleviating traffic, mitigating air pollution, and reducing the cost of commuting in Los Angeles and beyond, and to help many of its partners achieve their own sustainability goals. For example, Green Commuter recently partnered with L.A. County on an Air Resources Board Targeted Car Sharing Pilot Program grant, an effort that drew support from the Southern California Association of Governments, UC Berkeley’s Transportation Sustainability Research Center, California State Senators Carol Liu and Kevin de Leon, the California Energy Commission-designated Advanced Transportation Center of Southern California, the Fresno Council of Governments, Fresno County Rural Transit Agency, Fresno State University, Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC), and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, among others.","Green Commuter has an ambitious goal of putting 9,000 vanpools on the road in Southern California in the next five years, an objective that would remove 103,500 single occupancy vehicles from the road and avoid almost one million metric tons of CO2 Emissions. Such a goal, however, will only be possible with the backing and leverage of a coalition of support extending from governmental and political leaders, subsidies, grants, and conventional financing. Green Commuter has a robust research and development team that actively partners with different entities to apply for various grants and subsidies. In partnership with FCRTA, a Fresno based transit agency, for example, Green Commuter has already been awarded funding from the Department of Transportation/Caltrans.
  
 For the initial pilot program, however, Green Commuter plans to put 100 vehicles on the road in Los Angeles in early 2016. In order to purchase the vehicles for the pilot, as well as cover outreach, education, marketing, and operational costs, such a program will cost approximately $8,000,000. Green Commuter is a privately-held, minority-woman-owned benefit corporation incorporated in the State of California in 2014. As a start-up, Green Commuter is currently self-funded and in the process of receiving conventional financing to cover these costs. In addition, Green Commuter plans to continue to apply for grants and subsidies, both solely and in partnership with many of the government and non-profit collaborators it is partnering with. It is also in the process of launching a crowdfunding campaign and has had multiple investors express interest in investing in the company.","a. Outreach and Education (25% - $25,000)
 A crucial component of a successful pilot project is a targeted outreach campaign that focuses on the education of employees and the greater public on vanpooling and car sharing, and marketing these alternative transportation methods and their benefits. A portion of the requested funds will go towards agency fees ($20,000) for production and media costs, including billboard production, radio production, printing, and digital advertising, as well as some in-house marketing efforts administrative costs ($5,000). 
  
 b. Operations (75% - $75,000)
 Seventy-five percent of requested funds will be directed towards the operation of the service by Green Commuter. These funds will be directed towards the following items: Administration/Supplies/Services ($6,2500), Maintenance and Roadside Assistance Costs ($6,000), Software development support costs ($10,250), Green Commuter Salaries and Benefits ($22,500), and Insurance ($30,000).","Green Commuter plans to launch the service in the first quarter of 2016 by generating demand prior to deployment through pre-registration and executed service agreements for vanpooling, car sharing and fleet replacement by large employer centers, employees, universities, and individuals. By working with various entities across the city to introduce the pilot program, Green Commuter can tailor its model to meet the unique needs of a company’s systems and future initiatives. For example, employees at large employment centers and university faculty/staff at locations that have elected to implement Green Commuter’s car sharing service during the day can use the vehicles to grab lunch, run errands on breaks and go to offsite meetings. For other employers and local municipalities, there is a need to reduce costs for fleet maintenance. Leasing a fleet is more affordable for many employers who save on insurance, registration, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and fuel by using Green Commuter’s services. Regardless of the need, Green Commuter plans to introduce its model with an initial five to ten vehicles at each company, serving a diverse group of companies throughout the Los Angeles area. Green Commuter expects to launch the service with 100 total vehicles and forecasts the fleet to grow to 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2017. As other vehicles come to market that meet the range and passenger capacity criteria for the company’s model, Green Commuter intends to diversify its fleet."

This information will be developed into a public awareness campaign.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0Create0Live,"This project will focus on the positive health impacts of water-based recreation, and the negative impacts pollution can have on streams and human health in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
 
 Currently, there are disturbing equity and social justice issues in the way we monitor and respond to water quality issues of southern California’s streams. Water quality at southern California beaches is
 regularly monitored and communicated in high profile Beach Report Cards, but only a few studies have been conducted on the water quality of freshwater streams in the San Gabriel Mountains,
 where many low income and under-served residents of Los Angeles County recreate. Little is known about these health-related consequences compared to the wealth of knowledge accumulated about beaches and surfer health.
 
 Our program will potentially serve over three million people who visit the San Gabriel Mountains every year to swim in the area’s streams. The San Gabriel Mountains comprise 70% of Los Angeles County’s open space and provide 35% of the region’s drinking water. This region includes some of the most heavily visited public lands in the United States: more than three million people visit the San Gabriel Mountains every year to hike, fish, swim, and to simply enjoy the remarkable natural beauty of this National Forest. In October 2014, President Obama designated 346,177 acres in the San Gabriel Mountains as a National Monument: as a result, the already popular San Gabriel Mountains are set to receive even more visitors in the future.
 
 Education and awareness of the public on sources of environmental risk from water-based recreation will empower residents with the ability to protect themselves, their families and their communities. The project will also serve the community by training local area youth to serve as “watershed rangers” for the San Gabriel Mountains, working to educate visitors, community members, and peers about the value of outdoor recreation and stream health, and how to minimize impacts to water quality while also avoiding exposure to potentially harmful pollution.","A consensus-driven process is difficult to achieve, especially as it concerns human health impacts. Development of an effective public awareness campaign related to stream-based recreation and how this information will be served up to the public will not be an easy task. It will take directed and intensive planning and development of a well-thought out work plan. This work plan must be developed with the multiple entities involved in the issue to be effective and workable. 
 
 The Council for Watershed Health cannot do this alone. We recognize that the beast way to move froward is to bring together a diverse coalition of stakeholders to develop a well-coordinated approach for how to develop a public awareness campaign for stream-based recreation. The Council is uniquely poised to facilitate this process and bring all parties to the table to begin the discussion of how we can accomplish this together.","We know that fecal bacteria levels at popular freshwater swimming sites are elevated, especially during the summer months, and particularly on holiday weekends. The sampling and analytical methods used, however, do not allow for confirmation of potential sources of contamination. Therefore, additional information is required before making recommendations as to best management practices to reduce bacterial contamination at popular swim sites. We will evaluate our work in the following ways:
 
 1) Use of survey results to improve decision making in regards to best management practices for human health and stream-based recreation, 2) address the source of contamination in streams via monitoring and source tracking studies; 3) strengthen inter-agency partnerships via engagement meetings and collective input; 4) establishing a data exchange network or awareness mechanism to allow better public access to stream water quality data to make informed decisions.","California’s beach water quality monitoring program is the most rigorous in the nation. When water-quality standards are exceeded, officials are required to take action to protect swimmers by either closing the beach or positing warning signs that notify the public of possible health risks from water contact. Heal the Bay, a non-profit organization also based in Los Angeles, has spearheaded this effort.
 
  However, there are very few analogous checks in place for fresh water swim sites, especially for streams that receive high levels of recreation involving human body contact. The Los Angeles Dept. of Public Health regularly monitors the water quality in public swimming pools and recreational lakes, but not in wadeable streamson public lands that are frequented by the public for water-based recreation. 
 
 The most unique aspect of this program is the formation of novel partnerships to develop workable solutions to a complex management issue. The overall goal is to improve both human and watershed health, focusing on the positive health aspects of water-based recreation, as well as the negative impacts of pollution on streams and human health. 
 
 Novel forms of engagement and collaboration with disparate entities are key to the project’s overall success and have not been attempted on this level before. Through this program, we will bring together a diverse group of organizations to achieve common goals.
 
 Our approach is further unique in that: 1) there is no water quality awareness program currently in place for southern California’s recreational streams, and 2) water quality is an issue that extends beyond jurisdiction and demographics and requires an effective communication strategy informed by research, agency, and community input.
 
 We are confident the results of this program will characterize a new dimension of performance relative to similar programs in southern California because, unlike other groups, we holistically focus on all the beneficial uses the (environmental, economic, and social) of southern California’s watersheds. In addition, we are a nonpartisan organization staffed by leading experts in the water science field who are routinely sought by regional collaborative groups to assume a leadership role within them, assuring that: a diverse group of stakeholders integrate their efforts; best practice policies are followed; and results are effectively communicated to the public.","This grant award will be used mainly to fund development of a diverse working and planning group. We intend to engage and collaborate with a diverse number of organizations on this initiative, including the cities of Los Angeles and Burbank, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, LA County Sanitation Districts, United States Forest Service, Council of Mexican Federations, Conservation Authority, Amigos de los Rios, the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, and Friends of the Angeles.
 
 The Los Angeles and San Gabriel River Watershed Monitoring Programs are on-going, collaborative efforts intended to assess the health of these Watersheds from a regional perspective. The motivation for these programs comes from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, with monitoring a mandated activity for the Cities of Los Angeles and Burbank, as well as the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, to improve coordination and integration of monitoring efforts to increase awareness of watershed scale issues. Among the main concerns are water quality conditions and trends and safety for swimming/fishing. 
 
 The Environmental Health Division of Los Angeles Dept. of Public Health has a vision for a healthy and sustainable environment for all residents of LA County. One of their mandates is to educate the public on sources of environmental risk so they are empowered to protect themselves.
 
 The U.S. Forest Service's Forest Land Management Plan (LMP) for the Angeles National Forest recognizes the important role that the Forest plays in the education, outreach and development of stewardship within urban communities. The LMP recognizes that the rapidly increasing population of southern California, and identifies that the resulting effects on the natural environment is one of the main regional challenges facing the Forest Service. Therefore, a resulting goal of the LMP is to improve watershed conditions through cooperative management. The LMP also recognizes the need to offer a wide range of high quality, environmentally sustainable developed recreation opportunities suitable for the culturally diverse visitor population, while minimizing visitor conflicts and detrimental effects to natural resources. 
 
 Council of Mexican Federations (COFEM) promotes the advancement of the Latino Community in North America through public policy advocacy, community organizing, leadership and organizational development, educational and cultural programs.","This project is envisioned in three Phases: Phase I is scoping of the issue and workgroup engagement; Phase II is comprised of studies that link stream health to human health (epidemiological studies); and Phase III is making the changes (communications and awareness campaign). 
 
 The total cost for full implementation of all phases, especially Phase II, is beyond the 100k supplied by LA2050. The LA2050 grant funding will provide important seed funding for this effort. The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used for the planning and development of a communication plan related to this effort. We are working with other funding groups such as the California Endowment, the water Conservation Authority, and the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy to fund other aspects of this work. In-king match from the Los Angels Dept of Public Health is also being sought to fund other aspects of this work.","The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used to complete two primary tasks:
 
 1. $41,300: Analysis of previously collected water quality samples that will provide baseline data analysis for bacterial source identification. This will involve collaboration with research laboratories to conduct the analysis.
 
 2. $58,700: Working with public health and land management partners. This will be used to assemble the project partner workgroup/technical advisory committee and conduct meetings. As the facilitating organization, Council for Watershed Health will convene these meeting and host a series of workshops for the participating agencies that will be involved.","We plan to scale the success of this program in a number of ways, via effective phasing a measuring success at each phase and via small-scale demonstrations.
 
 This project is envisioned in three Phases: Phase I is scoping of the issue and workgroup engagement; Phase II is comprised of studies that link stream health to human health (epidemiological studies); and Phase III is making the changes (communications and awareness campaign). The 100k from the LA2050 grant will be used to develop the planning and communication piece of this effort. The success of the planning piece is critical to developing an effective communication and awareness campaign for stream-based water recreation activities. This efforts must have the full support of land mangers, public health agencies, and the public at large, The outcomes derived at Phase I will dictate the direction of the subsequent phases.
 
 Based on outcomes from the planning, this program will first be piloted at a small number of known swim sites in the LA River Watershed to develop a process for how this can be done at a larger regional scale. Over time, as success is measured, the program can be scaled up to include a larger portion of the LA River watershed, then the San Gabriel River Watershed, and eventually, the entire San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. We will start small and grow the program over time. 
 
 As an organization, the Council for Watershed Health values results based on applied research and analysis that inform policy change and lead to a more sustainable southern California region from the perspective of water quality and quantity management. Our program is unique in that it addresses diverse themes such as urban stormwater, watershed coordination, watershed monitoring, and the promotion of sustainable landscapes. Having access to multiple lines of information increases our ability to integrate various sectors and effectively carry out our core mission. This includes providing leadership, guidance, and assistance to other agencies and organizations to affect sound watershed planning and management, promoting better coordination and integration of watershed monitoring while measuring and tracking progress towards achieving healthier watersheds for humans and fostering a more sustainable regional landscape ethic for Los Angeles."
5102062,Help At-Risk Students in South L.A. Get on Track to Graduate,2018027,,Partnership public schools EIN: 261759681,"The high school dropout crisis is enormous in scope, yet highly concentrated in just a few neighborhoods, like South L.A. City Year LA and the Partnership are expanding our collaboration into Carver Middle School to ensure the most at-risk students reach their full potential. City Year AmeriCorps members will target 7th and 8th grade students who demonstrate risk factors for dropping out, providing more capacity to Partnership staff and school leadership to implement their vision at the school.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Carver Middle School (South Los Angeles),Learn,"As the graduation rate in the United States continues to rise—up to 81.4% for the class of 2013—progress in California schools and Los Angeles specifically, is crucial to reaching the national goal of a 90% graduation rate by 2020. The good news is that more students in Los Angeles are graduating every year. The Los Angeles Unified School District class of 2014 saw 70% of students graduate in four years, a tremendous increase from the 61% graduation rate for the class of 2011. However, there is still much work to be done, as 50% of dropouts in Los Angeles come from just 22% of high schools. Progress in these schools—where City Year and the Partnership strategically serve—will be a lynchpin for our city, state, and country’s success. We are turning around some of our city’s historically most-challenging campuses, where students struggle with academic achievement and the ongoing ramifications of generational poverty and violence. Both organizations are dedicated to making schools safe havens where students can learn and thrive. Combining our enhanced services – parent centers, community health facilities, etc., with additional adults serving as tutors, mentors, and role models – students will have a safety net to help them succeed. 
 Our collective efforts promote school-wide cultural norms and standards related to student responsibility, efficacy and interactions between peers, students and adults. When we can change school climates—encouraging trust, respect and support—the impact is profound. Students are interacting positively with adults, and feel a sense of pride and ownership in their school. School pride makes students more likely to work hard in the classroom, reach out to adults for extra support, and become more engaged in activities before, during, and after school, treating their school like the valuable community resource it should be. 
 
 This transformation will not just positively impact today’s students, but can ripple out to future generations. If students feel more connected to school and have greater success, they are more likely to graduate. If they graduate from high school, they will likely earn at least $1M more in their lifetime than if they drop out. If they drop out, they are three times more likely to be unemployed and eight times more likely to go to jail. This will not only impact their lives, but their children and grandchildren. By breaking the cycle now, we can set up future generations for continued and further success.","In order for City Year LA to be successful at Carver, it requires certain conditions for success, which include: sufficient time in the school schedule for tutoring; a willingness to share student-level data; time dedicated for administrators to meet regularly with City Year AmeriCorps members and leadership; and more. When starting at a new partner school, it often takes time for the school teachers and administration to buy into the work our AmeriCorps members are doing. However, City Year LA has a strong history of building partnerships effectively at Partnership schools and Carver expressed great interest in bringing City Year’s services to their campuses and are excited to have the team in service. During the first year City Year LA served at the Partnership’s Mendez High School, they had the highest one-year gain on the Academic Performance Index in California among traditional large schools. Our history of collaboration should make this year at Carver a success.","City Year LA focuses its measurement on the subset of students it serves, while the Partnership tracks data for all students in its network, looking at individual, grade-level and overall gains. Our outcomes are linked – if the lowest-performing population shows increases, it will elevate the entire school’s performance and improve the Partnership network results.
 
 The following are some of City Year LA’s and the Partnership’s proposed outcomes:
 
 • Provide individualized interventions to 150 students and extended learning time through City Year after-school programs to 100 students
 • Move 50% of students from an English language arts/math course grade of “D” or lower to a “C” or higher, or maintain/improve an existing “C”
 • Increase by 3 percentage points the number of students in 7th and 8th grade who meet or exceed the standards in English language arts and math
 • Elicit strong teacher feedback in which at least 85% of teachers report positive experiences with City Year.","While there are many excellent organizations working in education, we believe each of our programs has unique strengths. We also contend that the depth of our partnership and collaboration is extremely unique in the education space, which has a history of competition and contention. 
 
 Partnership for LA Schools is the only organization in Los Angeles with a track record of turning around the lowest-performing schools at scale and driving policy and programmatic changes that impact all students in LAUSD. While charter schools have shown progress toward increasing student achievement, few of their methods have proven scalable to-date, and not within the constraints of the current education system. The Partnership’s model offers another option for transforming schools that takes the benefits of charter schools and applies them in a way that is scalable to LAUSD. Partnership schools work with existing staff under labor contracts and serve all students within existing attendance boundaries. Because the Partnership team works side-by-side with LAUSD, quality practices developed in our schools can be shared with and eventually adopted by other District schools, and because Partnership schools are LAUSD schools and operate under the same District constraints, we can identify and remove barriers to success for our schools and others across LAUSD and the State.
 
 City Year also fills a unique void due to the comprehensive package of supports we provide for the most at-risk students. Teams of AmeriCorps members work from 7:30am-6:00pm to provide individualized tutoring, after-school and extracurricular programs, and positive school climate initiatives to turn around the early warning indicators for the students that need it most. We are also unique in the strong partnerships we build with teachers who report feeling more supported and able to differentiate instruction because of the AmeriCorps members’ consistent presence in their classroom. There are strong after-school programs and other student support organizations, but none that are fully integrated into the school day and classroom like City Year. AmeriCorps members are uniquely positioned to help students with their homework since they witnessed the lessons taught that day and can provide different perspective and support to students. 
 
 Again, the depth of this particular partnership is unique, leveraging our individual strengths, assets, and resources to better support students across Los Angeles.","Over the last six years, City Year LA and the Partnership have worked together to bring additional supports to our city’s most at-risk students. By expanding City Year LA services to Carver Middle School, AmeriCorps members will be serving at 10 of the 17 Partnership schools. When City Year partners with a new school, we look for a strong, positive school culture that is open to collaboration, committed to putting students first, and a fundamental belief in students’ potential to succeed. The Partnership embodies this philosophy by providing students better instruction, safer campuses, enrichment programs and activities, and a rigorous curriculum that offers a platform to realize their full potential. The Partnership greatly values City Year AmeriCorps members’ added-value by bringing additional individual attention to students that teachers often cannot extend in the course of a school day. 
 
 In 2013, Partnership for LA Schools recognized City Year as their Community Partner of the Year at its annual Family and Community Engagement Awards ceremony. We both deeply believe that our students are more likely to succeed if they attend a Partnership school with City Year corps members in the classroom. Our collaboration runs so deep that we have once again opted to apply for this grant together, rather than compete against one another. 
 
 In our past collaboration, we have found these three factors to be critical: 1) strong leadership from both organizations – on the ground level at the schools as well as at the senior level of our organizations; 2) shared values and a deep belief in our students and their potential; and 3) a willingness to leverage partnerships and outside resources to support our students and our work.","The total cost of the project is $833,000 per year. This cost covers full program implementation of City Year on a school campus with a team of 15 AmeriCorps members in collaboration with two FTE Partnership staff, a Director of School Transformation and a Manager of Family & Community Engagement, to align initiatives between all stakeholders. As an AmeriCorps program, City Year receives approximately one quarter of its annual budget from the government, both federal and state. Additionally, as a close partner of the Los Angeles Unified School District, City Year receive support from school partners. City Year has seen its funding from the school district increase annually since 2009, despite the difficult budget climate—a tribute to its work in schools, a close collaboration with the Partnership and the value the community and school staff see in the work. The remainder of City Year's funds is raised through the private sector. The Partnership is supported by a private $50M sustainable grant over 10 years that ends in 2017, and covers most of the organization's operating costs. Another $5M is raised annually with the support of former LA City Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa and other civic leaders through a combination of public and private dollars, including corporate and foundation partners who make our annual growth and expansion in LA possible.","The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools will use $50,000 to support the salary of their Partnership Support Team, who supports the school's implementation of their model.
 
 City Year LA will use $50,000 to support the salaries and benefits of the 16 AmeriCorps members at Carver ($27,569), the staff that supports our AmeriCorps members ($8,196), and for the other costs of materials and non-personnel items that support our program ($14,235). We can provide detailed budgets for both organizations upon request.","As the demand for City Year’s services continues to grow and more schools are identifying resources so that they can have a team serving on their campus, City Year is committed to our Long-Term Impact plan that will see City Year Los Angeles grow substantially—increasing the size of our corps and number of school partners until we have 770 AmeriCorps members serving in 63 schools across Los Angeles. At scale, City Year LA will serve 50% of the students who are off-track in our key low-income neighborhoods with a goal of 80% of students reaching the 10th grade on track to graduate. One of the Partnership’s key strategies for turning around low-performing schools is connecting them to effective community partners like City Year to increase a school’s capacity for transformation. The Partnership pilots programs at its schools, raising philanthropic dollars in the initial years and then over time, program costs are absorbed into schools' budgets while the need for Partnership staff oversight is diminished and can be deployed to other campuses. This enables the Partnership to meet the needs of its schools in a cost-effective way, providing a sustainable and scalable model."
5102100,Help Save The LAnd with Farm LA,2015063,,,We want to use this grant money to create a model farm that showcases a sustainable way to grow organic food. In the process we will educate and encourage the community to get involved and learn about a more health-conscious way of life.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Particularly focused in areas with unbuildable land.,00PlayLive,"Farm LA envisions a healthier, more self-sufficient Los Angeles by utilizing our vacant spaces for growing organic produce. We have an over abundance of deserted land in Los Angeles and an under abundance of affordable organic produce. Using the tools we have for harnessing the sun’s energy, being water-wise while growing drought-tolerant organic fruits and vegetables - We know the problems and we have the solutions.
 
 Imagine walking out of your house or apartment and seeing flourishing vegetables and herbs instead of neglected pieces of land. Imagine walking with your family within a ten-block radius and gathering organic produce for dinner knowing that they’ve witnessed the growth of those vegetables first-hand. This is our vision.
 
 Not only will we provide organic food for those in need and beautify the city, we will also teach our communities how to farm healthy food. We believe there is a lack of appreciation for where your food comes from and being an active part of that process will help one to make informed decisions about their diet. Farm LA presents at Childhood Obesity Awareness events and neighborhood council health fairs sharing interesting nutritional facts, delicious recipes and the tools to grow their own healthy food. We work with the UC Master Gardeners who have to satisfy a certain amount of volunteer hours every year and ask them educate our neighbors and volunteers. We also educate by connecting with schools who require their students volunteer a certain number of hours and have them join our volunteer days. By encouraging our Farm LA mentality at a younger age, we can expect that health-conscious way of thinking to grow and propagate, making LA the healthiest place to live.
 
 In our current drought predicament we are practicing water consciousness in everything we do. Farm LA wants to spearhead solar-powered atmospheric water generation to irrigate its drought-tolerant farms. This is not inexpensive, but due to the sustainability of it versus time and costs for water hook-up hurdles it is the most viable self-sustaining method, rendering us unaffected by a drought.
 
 Farm LA’s passion lies in turning vacant land into viable land. By creating a model of what we see as being the future of Los Angeles, we can continue creating a cultural awareness for a healthy sustainable way of life.","1- As a new non-profit organization we anticipate some challenges with gaining community support in pitching in and helping maintain our farms. Our strategy to overcome this is heavy community outreach in multiple languages to activate neighbors and get people excited. 
 2- We will have to comply with all local zoning and land-use laws and work through general red tape for having vegetable and or solar farms. Our plan to overcome these challenges is to work with city officials, neighborhood council, legal aid and pro-bono experts. 
 3- Being very new we obviously are concerned about our financial sustainability, our strategy to overcome this common challenge is persistent grant writing, fundraising and using funds only where necessary.","Our current evaluation process consists of measuring square footage converted and number of plants planted. Our future statistics and record keeping to evaluate our effectiveness will include: monetary donations, pounds of produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours accumulated, weight-loss success stories, kilowatts generated and gallons of water produced.","There are definitely other organizations aware of the abundance of underutilized land in Los Angeles. LA Open Acres’ amazing database filled with helpful tools will play a big part in our research of vacant land. LA Food Policy Council is also focused on making healthy food accessible in Los Angeles and is also very in the know on how much vacant land there is in LA. We want to utilize AB-551 (The Urban Agricultural Incentive Zone Act) with LA Food Policy Council and work with property owners in utilizing their land to grow fruits and vegetables. Together, we can create accessible affordable organic food for those with little access. These organizations will act as a facilitator for Farm LA, but Farm LA will physically create the transformation. LA Green Grounds is a similar organization with the mission to turn vacant space into gardens. Their focus however is more on front lawns and Farm LA’s mission is converting vacant unbuildable land into sustainable, drought-tolerant edible farms.",Farm LA is solely applying for the My LA2050 Grants Challenge.,"We feel confident in creating a functioning model farm in one year for $100,000. To keep the farm functioning we will create a sustainable financial business model in addition to fundraising and applying for grants to keep the farm going and growing indefinitely.
 If there are remaining funds from the $100K budget we would allocate them to our Farm LA curbside mini-garden program by the end of 2016.","Administration: $20,000 *Costs to ensure project runs on schedule and within budget/Collect monthly data/general paperwork

Even Detroit (a city with very different zoning laws than LA) only just recently started taking over vacant property to supplement organic food needs for its city. The closest thing we could be compared to might be the Victory Gardens of WWII, which were extremely successful and had massive funding by the US government. We are essentially creating the benchmarks for this kind of mission in Los Angeles with it’s own set of variables.
 
 For this reason we don’t have the standard 5 year reference for other programs who are doing the same thing to scale for success. But we plan to take a simple and effective collection of our monthly evaluated data (monetary donations, pounds of produce, visitors to site, new volunteer sign-ups, volunteer hours accumulated, weight-loss success stories, kilowatts generated and gallons of water produced) and from there we can identify the key components that make our program work that month and set key goals for our next month. 
 
 We plan to ensure the success of our model farm with outreach to students, after school programs, camps, senior centers, neighborhood councils, public offices and walking tours - if every person we meet looks at a vacant piece of land as an opportunity to grow organic food, we feel we are one step closer to a maturing healthy Los Angeles.
 
 We want our program to be easily replicated at the end of 2016 hopefully with the support of organizations and communities we’ve worked with that year combined with fundraising, grant writing and effective marketing we can replicate this model easily and count on reoccurring funding to ensure Farm LA’s efforts in making this the healthiest place to live by 2050.
 
 Though Farm LA is still young, we have the applicable skills to champion our mission. We have no problem taking on leadership roles or getting our hands dirty. We have a commitment to our dream, the passion to expand and serve new sites in the future."
5102237,Helping Los Angeles Youth Make Healthy Decisions And Access Care,2016172,,,"Now more than ever, PPLA is working to empower students to advocate for their own health by giving them the knowledge and skills to make positive decisions about their reproductive and sexual lives. We wrap around schools and communities through a multi-pronged approach that includes delivering an innovative classroom curriculum, teaching parents to effectively communicate, providing reproductive healthcare in schools, and training a cadre of dedicated high school student advocates.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,PPLA’s comprehensive work with high school-aged youth takes place primarily in South L.A. and Boyle Heights high schools.,0Create0Live,"Affordable reproductive health services and education remain out of reach for many teens in L.A. Pregnancy is the leading cause of high school dropout, and less than half of teens who give birth before the age of 18 graduate high school. Children born to teen parents are more likely to have poorer health, educational, and behavioral outcomes than children of older parents who planned their pregnancies. 
 
 In response, we are working with students, schools, and parents to ensure that the environment surrounding youth is supportive of healthy behaviors and choices. Our approach reduces rates of teen pregnancy, STIs, and reproductive system cancers while building a generation of confident and competent youth who are able to engage in conversations about consent, sexuality and gender, healthy relationships, and safe sex.
 
 Our High School program includes the following elements:
 -A 12-week classroom curriculum that addresses gender roles and power dynamics in relationships and emphasizes sexual rights, in addition to including content on anatomy, pregnancy, STIs, and contraception;
 -Education workshops for parents on adolescent sexuality, teen pregnancy, STIs, healthy relationships, values, and parent-teen communication;
 -An after-school Peer Advocates leadership program;
 -Access to confidential and youth-friendly reproductive health services on school campuses. 
 
 Peer Advocates convene community events and conduct outreach in their schools through classroom presentations, lunch tabling, after-school outreach activities and community events. They have also harnessed the power of social media by creating original content designed to engage youth outside the classroom, including a Tumblr page called Keep It Real, Keep it 100 and videos on topics such as LGBT inclusivity, talking to your partner about getting tested, and the services available to youth at PPLA health clinics. As more youth turn to the internet to answer their questions about sexual and reproductive health, PPLA aims to provide accurate, inclusive, and culturally competent educational materials that appeal to teens.
 
 Students participating in the Peer Advocates program gain valuable skills that translate into their personal and professional lives- they are trained to be leaders, communicators, activists, educators, innovators, and critical thinkers. Many of the Peer Advocates go on to continue their advocacy work in college and beyond.","In 2003, California passed the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act (SB71). The passage of SB71 was a key step in ensuring the health of California youth, but there is much work to be done to ensure proper implementation. California’s financial crisis has eroded much of its network of preventive health programs, making schools one of the last strongholds for providing sex education. Many schools still provide abstinence-only programs despite policies forbidding them. While the state does evaluate school districts for compliance, its capacity is limited. Research has shown little to no training for sex educators and a significant number of districts with policies not in compliance with the California Education Code. To address this, we will work closely with LAUSD to advocate for comprehensive sex education. At the state level, we will advocate for a state-wide comprehensive sex education mandate in support of teen health and pregnancy prevention.","PPLA will work to increase knowledge related to reproductive health and wellness, family planning, the key elements of healthy family communication and the importance of seeking health services. The longer term goal of our program is to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy, STIs and reproductive system cancers. PPLA education staff utilize our Sex Education Knowledge System (SEKS) to track information on all of our educational and outreach presentations and visits. This data management system tracks the number of presentations, participants, educational contact hours, presenters, and sites. Pre and post-tests of the Peer Advocates program measure changes in attitudes and knowledge of program participants. PPLA has also contracted with the University of Southern California and the Public Health Institute to evaluate our multi-pronged education program. Researchers found significant results regarding changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviors after program participation.","Many schools in L.A. County choose to use their own staff to teach sex education courses. These courses are often taught by teachers who are unprepared or uncomfortable with the subject matter, and the courses are often not inclusive of gender, sexuality, and cultural differences. What is unique about the PPLA Sex Education program is the comprehensive, inclusive, rights-based approach to sexual and reproductive health. The program does not end in the classroom- PPLA staff work with educators, families and community members to improve the dialogue surrounding sexual health, and Peer Advocates work in their communities and online to promote PPLA’s inclusive, rights-based curriculum and serve as advocates and educators for fellow students and youth. Anecdotally, the results of our approach are striking- one year after the implementation of our multi-pronged approach in one Los Angeles high school, reported positive pregnancy tests dropped from 32 during the Spring term in the first year to 3 in the second year.","PPLA works closely with both the Los Angeles Unified School District and Green Dot Charter Schools to deliver our sex education curriculum in their schools. Currently, we provide education programs in over 35 high schools throughout L.A. County. The schools would not receive grant money directly, but would continue to receive the education and healthcare services provided by PPLA.","For the current fiscal year, PPLA’s school-based sex education program budget is $620,012.

We have 66 trained Peer Advocates across 6 schools in Boyle Heights (Roosevelt High School, Mendez High School, and Hollywood High School) and South Los Angeles (King Drew Medical Magnet High School, Animo Pat Brown Charter High School, and Ralph Bunche High School). In 2015, we saw the incorporation of one additional school- Hollywood High School- to the Peer Advocates program.
 
 In order to scale the success of our proposal, PPLA aims to do the following:
 
 -Continue to elevate the youth voice by working with Peer Advocates to create and disseminate original social media content.
 
 -Engage Peer Advocates in activities of the District 2 STD Collaborative, the Community Advisory Coalition, which aims to decrease the high rates of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia among youth of color in South Los Angeles. 
 
 -Work with Peer Advocates to get articles published in local online newspapers, such as the Boyle Heights Beat and the LA Times.
 
 On a broader scale, PPLA is currently in the process of leveraging the results of rigorous research on our sexual education programs by engaging the voice of our Peer Advocates to promote access to comprehensive, rights-based, gender aware sexuality education and services for their friends, communities and teens across the country. PPLA will strengthen the youth voice to influence and advance the public conversation around comprehensive sexuality education via: 
 
 -Strategic communications/social media targeting youth, parents, colleague agencies, school administration and other key decision makers.
 
 -Youth and parental engagement and creation of a cohort of advocates and leaders around comprehensive sexuality education. 
 
 PPLA will utilize the program evaluation results to influence the public conversation and increase policymaker support of comprehensive sexuality education via: 
 
 -Policy analysis and recommendations to local and national audiences; 
 
 -Local and national dissemination and communications activities and
  
 -Publication of the research results in a variety of fora."
5102188,High School CPR Training,2015123,,,"During each academic year hands-only CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) will be taught in high school health classes throughout LAUSD. Each year 50,000 students will be prepared to save lives with CPR.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,Live,"Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans. 375,000 cardiac arrests occur each year throughout the nation, 88% of them at home. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and premature death in Los Angeles. Preventing people from dying of heart attacks, drowning, and choking will increase the life span of Angelenos. Imagine a high school student being able to save the life of a parent, a grandparent, sibling, friend, neighbor, or even a stranger. High school students live throughout the city. In addition to their presence at school and at home with their families, they may also work in businesses, participate in sports and recreation programs, attend religious institutions, go to entertainment and cultural event, and drive on surface street and freeways where there may be accidents. The6y are positioned to respond in many locations throughout the city. If CPR is administered in the first minute, there is an 87% chance of the patient surviving.",The major challenge we anticipate is coordination between LAUSD entities and the LAFD. Communication between the district and individual schools is essential so that scheduling at each school goes smoothly. Our strategy is to work regionally within the school district so that training is scheduled systematically in school health classes.,"One aspect of evaluations is based purely on numbers. How many students were trained? Tracking each student after they complete the course or after they graduate high school will be nearly impossible. Thus, we need to develop creative methods to stay in touch with trained students or we may never know whether or not they responded to a heart attach emergency and how many lives were saved. Arriving LAFD medical technicians and paramedics will know if a civilian administered CPR before their arrival. This can give us an indirect approximation of the benefit of the program. Moreover, through social media, we will develop reminders for this generation of connected youth to check in if they helped with a heart attack victim.","Although the American Red Cross provides similar CPR training, they are not targeting high school students. The National HART Foundation is offering CPR training at LA County high schools, but this does not include the 178,500 students currently attending high schools in the City of Los Angels. Twenty-seven states in the United States require CPR training in public schools. Annually 1.6 million students will be trained in those states.
 
 In addition to focusing on LAUSD, the use of firefighters and paramedics as trainers is unique. Strengthening the relationship of first responders and teens can be a benefit in enhancing community public safety and preparing for disaster response.","Our major partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and they are also the beneficiary of the program. The LAFD Foundation will receive the funding, and LAUSD high school health classes will receive the services.","Costs are projected just under $100,000 for the first year.
 Many of the costs in the budget are start-up costs for the first year of the project. Expenses will go down in the second year.
 
 Additional costs are being covered by the Los Angeles Fire Department. They are paying salaries and benefits of the coordinator and trainers. They are providing two vans, fuel, and maintenance to transport the trainers and equipment.
 
 Because the department is short on vehicles, we will be looking for a donation of two new or late-model vans, but will be supported by LAFD in the interim.","Laptop computers (2) $6079

Moreover, the program could be replicated anywhere in the State of California or the United States, using our curriculum and materials. It is worth noting that the California legislature is reintroducing a bill that was defeated last session requiring CPR training in all high schools throughout the state. We are certain that every community would want this level of training, and we know that every firefighter and paramedic has the skills to do the training. Joining with fire departments and other public health organizations in California, we support legislation to mandate training throughout California and hope the High School CPR Training Program will serve as a cost-effective, efficient model for this anticipated new law.
 
 Saving lives is important. Giving teenagers the tools to save lives is empowering for them and good for the health of the community."
5102255,History Detectives 2.0,2015169,,,"History Detectives 2.0 offers K-12 LA students a chance to discover history, art, architecture themselves.

The desire to experience learning; the esteem-building experience of creating and sharing what has been created can be addictive and form habits that result in self-actualization, even in children. 
 
 Our goal: to create a desire to express the need to learn. 
 
 We want each team to grow as a result of their journeys throughout LA as they discover events, people, ways of thinking that may never have made inclusion in any of their required texts/readings.
 
 Our pilot program will introduce Lesson Plans that are intended to allow students a chance to explore political heros, of all ethnic backgrounds that contribute to the city LA has become today. An array of options will be offered, each Team on the 10-week journeys will select the adventure they will go on.","One obstacle may include overcoming a subtle belief that having fun while ""in school"" may be a little too submissive to the students' inclination toward disruption. By showing respect for curiosity and using the motivation of participating in a fascinating way to learn, our intention is to demonstrate that fun can be a motivator and can help with behavioral issues teachers must control.
 
 We will document cooperation, team-work, respect for others, and a dedication to each Team's project as a team to persuade teachers and administrators to give our approach to learning a chance to succeed.","We will carefully carve out agreed upon Objectives. They may vary with individual Teams and varying Projects but will certainly include variations of:
 
 #'s of students participating for each Project period
 #'s of Projects selected
 #'s of Projects completed
 #'s of LA sites visited & made a part of a developing partnership
 #'s of future sponsors attracted
 Amt of new funding acquired
 #'s of participating artists-in-residence
 
 For each Objective, we will chart how our actual #'s line up with the projected numbers at the start of each Project.
 
 The closer we come to our projections at the end of each Project, the closer we will be able to say we made our numbers.
 
 There will be a variety of intangible measures that we can tract through word-of-mouth with the Participants, through survey's, through observation, and through video/radio spots they create themselves--Like PSA's for those who will come later.","Journey's intent on offering cultural 1/2 day walks (The LA Conservancy; the Friends of the LA River; The Tree People are examples of exploratory learning adventures in the heart of LA. Many museums as well tell their version of the LA Story. The tours mentioned here and many museums are geared to an adult clientele. And most tours exist as revenue based endeavors. Most youth would probably not have an opportunity to enlist in such an adventure. Those who would--most likely would be a part of a family outing. Three or four tickets for a morning walk is a heavy financial sacrifice for the majority of LA families.
 
 Our participants will live in South Central. Parents work in South LA. Many have two jobs. Any time off is not going to include recreational learning as a priority. With our participants' parents permission, school/school-time can serve another role--a place to learn, a place to have fun, a place to see the City and begin to understand the cultural history, the stories of those who made the headlines, and many fascinating stories of those who didn't make the headlines but who make LA what it is.
 
 Our uniqueness is the ability to offer this type of experiential learning opportunity...for youth...during school in chaperoned and curriculum-based manners, free of charge.","We did not list but will work with the roster of past Robey actors, playwrights, tech theatre artists, and designers. They number in the hundreds and will help participants annotate the stories they discover.
 
 Many of those actors, writers and theatre professionals have their own production companies. We will partner with those with skills/interests needed for particular projects.
 
 Over twenty years in LA, the Robey also has a host of colleagues operating a variety of other theatre companies, galleries, restaurants, and ethnically-specific cultural projects that will offer participation on an ad hoc basis as the projects unfold.","The retro-fitting of the bus could cost the entire $100,000.

5102106,Hollywood Central Park proves that LA is the Best Place to Play,2015068,,,"Our proposal is to hold a design competition for LA-based architects and landscape designers to create an iconic design for the Hollywood Central Park. The goal is to create a 38-acre urban park that caps the Hollywood Freeway, and serves diverse, dense and disadvantaged communities separated for more than 60 years by the freeway. It should be a park that could exist only in Hollywood and is intrinsic to Los Angeles. It must connect the surrounding communities through innovative design.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Hollywood,ALL,"There are many exciting ways the Hollywood Central Park will make the LA the best place to play. It will offer myriad recreational amenities like children’s playgrounds, baseball diamond, library, amphitheater, walking/running trails, and picnic areas. 
 
 Most importantly, it will improve the quality of life for more than 150,000 residents, including 30,000 children, who live within a one-mile radius of HCP. HCP is located in Council District 13, which has among the lowest resident to park space ratios in the state. While the City Charter requires 2 acres of open space per 1000 residents, Hollywood only has 0.02 acres of open space per 1000 residents. Beyond the recreational benefits, the Hollywood Central Park will boost the economy by creating more than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, while the vastly increased green space and trees will help clean the air and promote a healthier urban living environment.
 
 With this one project, Los Angeles will address the economy, the environment, the health of its residents and their quality of life. As a leader in sustainable cities and livable communities, LA will, without a doubt, be the best place to play.
 
 The Park design will be key in achieving these objectives. The best design for the Hollywood Central Park will only be achieved by utilizing the uniquely qualified, creative, and visionary talents of local architects and landscape architects who genuinely understand the complexities of designing open space for a city of 465 square miles. Our LA 2050 proposal seeks to identify the best and brightest architectural minds in Los Angeles through a design competition to guarantee that LA is the best place to play.
 
 The HCP Design Competition has 3 phases. Phase 1 is a conceptual proposal clearly describing the park design and its relationship to Hollywood. Phase 2 is a full-scale design of a fully realized public space that meets HCP Design Guidelines. Phase 3 is a Citywide Exhibition Event for the top 5 proposals. To ensure a diversity of ideas and to level the playing field for emerging architects, designers and smaller firms, proposers moving onto Phase 2 will be required to spend no more than $5000 on their submissions. Throughout this process, we will engage not only architects and park supporters, but also residents, businesses, and other stakeholders to collaboratively harness the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results.","A challenge for the Design Competition is ensuring the Park design meets our goals for recreational, environmental, and health benefits. The multi-phase process that engages a broad range of stakeholders will help overcome this challenge and ensure the Park meets residents’ needs.
 
 Gentrification will be a major challenge to the Park itself, which could push out existing low-income residents as property values increase. Friends of the Hollywood Central Park (FHCP) will overcome this obstacle with multiple strategies. The Design Guidelines for the Competition will require competitors to incorporate design elements that are inclusive of all LA residents, with a focus on engaging nearby low-income residents. FHCP has a commitment to preserving and expanding affordable housing around the park, and is actively working to create an Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District, apply for Cap and Trade funding, and other strategies designed to maintain Hollywood as a mixed income community.","The Design Competition will be evaluated by a jury comprised of participants from the Mayor’s office, Council District 13, Planning Department, Recreation and Parks Department, Promise Zone, leaders from the architecture/landscape design community, community residents, stakeholders and FHCP representatives.
 
 The jury will evaluate Park designs using the following criteria. 
 1. Does the design meet the HCP Park Ethic of service to Community, Well-Being and Sustainability?
 2. Does the HCP Design enhance the unique characteristics of surrounding communities by investing in healthy, safe, and walkable neighborhoods?
 3. Does the HCP Design enhance and encourage such strategies as transit-oriented, mixed-use development and land recycling—to increase community revitalization, improve the efficiency of public works investments, and safeguard viewscapes/landscapes?
 4. Does the HCP Design prove that HCP could only exist in Hollywood, California?","In LA County, there are five deck parks in various stages of planning. However, the Hollywood Central Park is the furthest along in several important ways that are required to implement a park on this scale. Hollywood Central Park’s Draft Environmental Impact Report is scheduled to be released in fall of 2015. Unlike the others, Hollywood Central Park is already an official project of the City of Los Angeles (Case # NP-14-004-RP) and at 38 acres, is the largest deck park of the five proposed. 
 
 Our proposed Design Competition is unique in its plan to engage a broad array of stakeholders, as well as our commitment to implementing a Park Design created by an Angeleno, for Angelenos. The unique nature of the Hollywood Central Park demands a design that is developed by an architect or landscape designer who truly understands the context of Hollywood and Los Angeles.
 
 The vision for the Hollywood Central Park came from the surrounding community, the product of a collaborative participatory effort; bottom up planning as opposed to top down. Through a program of workshop meetings centered on the participation of a wide representation of members of the community, the project proponents have facilitated the creation of a concept plan. 
 
 Because the Hollywood Central Park is located in a dense urban environment, our park project is unique in that our affordable housing component is equally as important as building the park. We are truly committed to ensuring existing residents can remain in the community and enjoy the benefits of the Park. 
 
 The Hollywood Central Park Initiative focuses on creating sustainable communities by integrating polices related to land use, housing, transportation, human health, the economy and the environment. The Park serves as a demonstration project of the six livability principles and informs the work of President Obama’s mission to prioritize ecosystem restoration in urban areas and connect urban youth with the outdoors. 
 
 This catalytic project has broad community support from diverse stakeholders, including residents, businesses, state and local agencies and elected officials with goals and objectives that are in alignment with Mayor Garcetti’s priorities. Friends of the Hollywood Central Park is a perfect example of individuals and institutions working together to solve community problems and create successful change.","FHCP is a partner of the Los Angeles Promise Zone, a federal initiative of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Los Angeles Promise Zone was designated as one of the first five in the entire country in 2014 by President Obama, and in LA this effort is led by the Mayor’s Office and includes over 50 public and private partners. The goals of the LA Promise Zone are to transform poverty-stricken neighborhoods in central Los Angeles into communities of opportunity by preserving housing affordability, improving education and public safety, creating jobs and spurring economic development. The Hollywood Central Park is located directly within the boundaries of the Promise Zone and will contribute to many of the Promise Zone goals. FHCP works closely with the Mayor’s Office and other Promise Zone partners. 
 
 FHCP also collaborates with many local Hollywood nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and neighborhood councils and home owners’ associations. These include the Los Angeles Beautification Team, STEM Academy at Bernstein High School Complex, and Hollywood Community Housing Corporation. 
 
 For the Design Competition, FHCP intends to provide a $7,500 stipend to the Los Angeles Beautification Team for providing time and expertise to the Phase 2 finalists, as they are a leading nonprofit in the LA area for environmental and sustainable projects. FHCP has partnered with the LA Beautification Team on other projects to prepare for the building of the Hollywood Central Park, including recently planting 542 trees to create an urban forest on 10 streets leading into the Park. 
 
 FHCP partners with STEM Academy High School in Hollywood, which has an Engineering track. We will provide STEM Academy students with paid internships (total of $7,500 allocated for this) to assist FHCP in implementing the Design Competition. Interns will help with outreach to publicize the Competition, with behind-the-scenes organizing, and will serve on the jury. This builds on our current internship program for STEM Academy engineering students, where they have participated in activities like developing their own park designs and hosting community engagement events.","The Hollywood Central Park Design Competition will cost no more than $100,000, but it will contribute significantly to advancing our timeline for building the Park. A portion of the LA2050 funding will help us prepare for the Design Competition, including providing paid internships for STEM Academy high school engineering students. The majority of the funds will be reserved to host the city-wide Hollywood Central Park Design Exhibition that comprises Phase 3 of the Competition. The top 10 finalists will install and showcase their designs to the public, and we will make a special effort to ensure local residents and other neighborhood stakeholders are engaged in the Exhibition.","$15,000 in funding will support partners LABT and STEM Academy as described in the partnerships section above. $15,000 is to prepare for the Design Competition, including documenting eligibility and design requirements, publicity, printing/copying, website, graphic design, and legal review. $5,000 is for costs associated with Phases 1 and 2 of Competition, including proposal printing and review, eligibility check, jury meetings/review, and notification of top 10 proposals. $25,000 is for Competition Phase 3, which will be a city-wide exhibition event hosted at a venue in Hollywood. Funding will cover public relations/outreach for the Exhibition, signage, project installations/curation, and event costs like décor and food. $33,000 is for awards (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and two honorable mentions).","FHCP’s Design Competition will naturally be scaled since it links directly to building the Hollywood Central Park. At the conclusion of the Competition, we will have a park design that allows us to move forward on the next steps for building the Park. 
 
 In addition, throughout the LA2050 grant year, FHCP will document each step of the Design Competition, including challenges and best practices. This information will be available to other groups interested in deck parks, including the other four currently proposed in LA County. Our hope is that other deck parks can learn from FHCP’s Design Competition and the subsequent steps needed to build the park. Our focus on finding a design created by Angelenos for Angelenos can be replicated within LA, as well as for other cities considering deck parks. Local design will help ensure each future Park is built to meet the needs and context of the neighborhoods surrounding the Park."
5102134,Hollywood Curling- Building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center in Los Angeles,2015086,,,"Since 2007, we have grown the sport of curling in Los Angeles under poor ice conditions and limited availability from local hockey rinks. We are in the process of building the San Fernando Valley Curling Center by adapting an existing building that would be dedicated to the specific requirements of this sport. A dedicated facility will enable us to realize our mission of being inclusive, expanding youth and wheelchair programs, as well as promote lasting social connections in the community.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,"San Fernando Blvd, City of San Fernando; Los Angeles County",Learn,"Curling is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Last year, we taught over 1500 people how to curl during and after the 2014 Olympics, with most of our events selling out, and the demand outpaced our limited ice availability from local hockey rinks. 
 
 Accessibility & Equality
 
 Accessibility is what makes the sport of curling uniquely social, connecting people from all walks of life. Anyone can learn how to curl, including kids, seniors, men, women, and those that are wheelchair bound. The unique social aspect of the sport encourages connections with fellow league players in your own community, as well as fellow curlers from across the country at various tournaments. Curling is a sport where a CEO can be captained by a college student, where men and women play on equal footing, and wheelchair curlers can play alongside those who are not. A person who learned to play last week can end up playing with an Olympian in a tournament next week. Curling is a catalyst to enable people to come together, gain emotional support, and create lifelong friendships and bonds.
 
 Youth Initiatives
 
 In our dedicated facility, we plan on expanding our School of Rocks program, where we first teach the game to kids in school gymnasiums using a floor curling set up, and then we get them on the ice to participate in a safe, challenging, and rewarding sport. In our current arrangement with local hockey rinks, we lack the ability to offer after school programming at times suitable for our younger members. A dedicated facility would allow us to offer youth leagues, family programming, and afterschool mentorship programs to local kids and young adults. 
 
 Volunteerism
 
 As a volunteer run, 501-(c)-3 non-profit organization, we rely on our members to volunteer their time and energy to promote the sport through teaching beginner Learn to Curl classes, assisting with corporate events, and assisting with community outreach events. Past community events where we have brought our portable street curling set up include CicLAvia and the recent inaugural San Fernando Chile Festival. Additionally, our volunteers will be encouraged to participate in activities with partner organizations, via community outreach, youth coaching and supervision, and accessibility programs.","Start up expenses represent the largest hurdle. To build our facility, we need approximately $645K. 
 
 We have a multifaceted plan to obtain the funds we need to retrofit an existing space for curling, involving capital equipment purchases and construction. We have been actively fundraising for several years, including raffles, tournaments, and auctions. Using our connections within the national and international curling community, we plan on casting a large viral net to capture the support of other curlers and clubs around the globe. Additionally, we plan on approaching local business and corporations to attract valuable sponsorship dollars and in-kind donations.
 
 Hollywood Curling operates with the philosophy that every event or action should yield a positive net return, or at least be revenue neutral. This philosophy is being carried over into our dedicated ice initiatives and fundraising plans with a mindful eye to responsible fiscal decisions.
 
 (See budget for breakdown).","Goals:
 Open a dedicated curling facility. The completion of this task is our first evaluation marker.
 
 Introduction and exposure of the sport to local Angelenos. Success of this goal will be measured quantitatively by:
 - The number of members
 - The number of active leagues
 - Attendance at tournaments & intro lessons
 - Learn to curl attendance
 - Number of private events
 - National and regional events hosted
 
 Increased Annual Growth: Goal of 400+ members within 5 years through marketing and outreach efforts. 
 
 Expansion of Specialty Leagues: In addition to our open and skills specific leagues, we plan to have youth, college, LGBT, municipal, and studio leagues. Additionally, corporate team building events and private parties. This goal will be evaluated based on the variety of programming achieved within the first 3-5 years with outreach into those respective communities.","There are a number of other sports leagues in the city, including venue specific sports such as ice rinks and bowling alleys. There are NO other curling organizations in Los Angeles; we are the only place to curl and our own building would ensure we remain the only league in place for an extended period of time. 
 
 That said, we do compete with other entertainment and sporting opportunities which can make it challenging to break through the clutter. We get a tremendous boost every four years during the Olympics, and in 2018 there will be another curling event added to the Olympic roster. We believe that a facility of our own, at that time, will have a massive impact on the scope of people we are able to reach.
 
 Curling may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of sports in Los Angeles. It is a grass roots sport that has taken off here, and in other cities in temperate climates across the country, including Phoenix, San Francisco, San Diego and Las Vegas. The fact that Los Angeles is already known for its Olympic legacy and future Olympic aspirations strengthens the desire to showcase this increasingly popular and unique sport.

This includes permitting & professional fees, ice making equipment and installation, HVAC requirements, construction & build out costs, rent deposit to secure the lease, and contingency. To cover this amount we’ve got a multi-faceted approach to our fundraising:
 
 General Fund - $90K on hand. Through fundraising specific tasks such as our recent Viking River Cruise raffle, as well as leagues, lessons and corporate parties.
 
 Solicited Donations/ Member Contributions - $200K. Pledges from our 100+ members, as well as solicited donations from other clubs.
 
 Crowdfunding - Goal: $90-100K. Using a site like Indiegogo, we will appeal to the wider curling community in Canada and the US, and plan on utilizing our network within the high performance curling community around the globe to help spread the word and make the campaign go viral.
 
 Corporate Sponsorship - Goal: $50-100K. With the number of people who will come through the door, particularly during the Olympic years, we plan to utilize our non-profit status to sell sponsorship opportunities
 
 Presales - $25K. Through group sales sites such as Groupon or Living Social we can offer advanced deals for learn to curl classes. 
 
 Loans- $50-100K (max $250K available) - Utilizing an interest-free loan program from World Curling Federation, with funds earmarked for the building of new brick & mortar facilities. 
 
 In Kind Donations- $30-50K. From construction materials, furniture, office equipment, contractor fees, and professional fees.
 
 Total Estimated Fundraising Goals: $545K

 - To engage Angelenos in a unique and rewarding social experience
 
 Our plan is for five sheets of curling ice. This will already be an expansion of ice capacity from our current use. We will have ample opportunity to expand our programing as needed, including adding tournaments and private events. Expanding our marketing reach will be critical to capitalizing on the additional scheduling opportunities we will be able to offer. A facility of this size is suitable for hosting national championship events in the future, making Los Angeles a destination for tournaments, workshops, skills clinics and other training events.
 
 San Fernando is also strategically located so that if we are successful, we can expand to other areas of the county, such as San Gabriel Valley, the harbor cities, or west side. During the next Olympic cycles, we will be able to introduce curling at local ice rinks in these locations with the support and equipment provided by our dedicated facility and volunteers as a home base.
 
 With your generous assistance will reach our goal of offering the game of curling to the local community, foster the social and competitive spirit of curling, and teach and develop curlers to compete at a local and national level. This grant opportunity comes at a crucial time in our fundraising campaigns and will ensure the growth of the organization and sport of curling in Los Angeles."
5102135,Hollywood HEART: Arts in the Classroom,2015087,,,Hollywood HEART would like to sustain and build on its pilot program creating arts-enriched learning environments for high school students in low-income and underserved communities. We are currently partnering with LA High School to transform their campus through in-class and after-school arts workshops. We seek funding to sustain our program at LA High School and to launch new partnerships; potential candidates include Fairfax and Venice High Schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0Create0Live,"Hollywood HEART is dedicated to building the best future for our young people, regardless of the challenges they face. If our city is to thrive in 2050, we must educate our youth to become innovative thinkers and problem solvers, to move comfortably between art and technology, and to have the skills and perseverance to succeed in the creative economy. Hollywood HEART strives to ensure that the opportunities that lie ahead are open to all. From filmmaking to culinary arts, fashion to photography, the arts lead to growth and opportunity for our young people and for LA.
  
 Through our programming, Hollywood HEART provides a pathway that encourages students to graduate from high school and succeed in college/career training programs. By linking in-class and after-school Workshops, we encourage long term engagement in the arts that has been proven to increase academic achievement and graduation rates. Arts education is vital to the future of Los Angeles. As noted scholar, Shirley Brice Heath, observes “cultural strategies are vastly underutilized and misunderstood…What leaders fail to realize is that culture is a school-to-work strategy, a youth development strategy, and an economic enterprise strategy.” Nowhere is this more true than in Los Angeles, the heart of the creative economy, not just for the US but for the world.
  
 Hollywood HEART works with schools to design in-class Educational Arts Workshops that integrate creative skills into core academic curriculum and provide after-school programs for students who want to continue working in their chosen art form. We bring in volunteers and guest speakers to work with the students and talk to them about creative career opportunities. Hollywood HEART is also forging partnerships with community and four-year colleges to build a high school to college pipeline for low-income students interested in creative careers. We are partnering with the entertainment industry to encourage diversity and incorporate new perspectives into their workforce.
  
 With support from LA 2050, Hollywood HEART will be able fully implement its program at LA High School and expand to two new schools. We will be able to tailor our workshops to each school’s curriculum and provide performances and exhibitions to engage the entire community.
 
 By ensuring that young people have sustained access to the arts, we are making LA the best place to learn.","The greatest challenge Hollywood HEART faces is that some of the students we serve have such little exposure to the arts that they won’t seek out arts electives and after-school programs even if offered. We have encountered this challenge at a number of schools and are developing two complementary responses. The first strategy, which we are implementing at LA High School with initial success is to implement in-class workshops. Past experience has shown us that once students experience our workshops and get to know our talented teaching artists they will voluntarily participate in after-school programs and even recruit their friends. We are also launching an outreach effort to better market our workshops. Can we encourage participation by re-imagining some programs and changing others: are young people more motivated if we call their short films Youtube videos? Would they be more inspired by guitar or dance workshops?","Hollywood HEART is committed to a strong evaluation process. Our extensive internal assessment strategy includes administering pre- and post-program surveys to measure student interest and skill acquisition in the arts as well as their self-assessment of school engagement and class participation. Classroom teachers will evaluate program implementation, the quality of instruction, and alignment to the Common Core as well as the impact on student engagement and performance. We encourage the school administrations to provide comparative data on school attendance and achievement.","We are aware of many organizations that bring arts programming to schools but none that that share the breadth and depth of our vision. The great majority of nonprofit arts organizations working in the schools concentrate primarily on elementary and middle school students. This includes many of the larger programs such as P.S. Arts and the CalArts Community Arts Partnership. There are also a number of significant nonprofits working to encourage low-income and minority students to stay in school and transition successfully to college. These efforts, including the Fulfillment Fund, work in schools with similar demographics as Hollywood HEART but target high achieving students. In contrast, Hollywood HEART works with older youth and seeks to impact the entire student body at our partner schools
 
 A number of characteristics set Hollywood HEART’s program apart; first and foremost is our willingness to listen to classroom teachers and school administrators and create programs tailored to the needs and interests of their students. We arrive with many ideas but few restrictions: we build workshops around class readings, adapt programs to student interests, and work with teachers to use our programs to offer struggling students extra-credit projects. Hollywood HEART’s approach is also unique in its focus on school culture. Our goal is not just to impact individual students, or even classes; our goal is to transform the culture of the school. We do this by bringing multiple programs into the schools; supporting schoolwide performances, linking in-class and after-school programs. We also collaborate with other nonprofits to integrate their work into our efforts and reach out to the surrounding community. 
 
 The LA 2050 Challenge encourages the applicants to look beyond their immediate objectives to consider how we can work together to create a powerful future for Los Angeles. Hollywood HEART also stands out for its long-term vision. Our goal is to work towards building bridges between our partnership schools and community and four-year colleges. We know that an investment in our schools and our students is critical to forging a successful future, and by focusing on those most in need we can maximize the impact of our efforts.","Hollywood HEART hires teaching artists to implement our Educational Arts Workshops. On occasion we have implemented curriculum developed by other nonprofits who offer specific workshops that align with our pedagogical model. We have collaborated with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, using their free social justice curriculum, Speak Truth to Power and Rabbit Hole Screenings, a small nonprofit that uses film as an entryway into personal creativity and personal growth for at-risk students. Hollywood HEART has hired individuals trained by these organizations to lead the workshops but has not entered into any contracts directly with the nonprofit organizations.","The program we are proposing is for the LA 2050 Challenge is budgeted at $100,000. We have a number of additional grant proposals pending for this effort. The ultimate size of the effort will depend on the total amount of funds we receive. However, the LA 2050 Challenge grant by itself will allow us to sustain and further improve our partnership with LA High School and to begin programming at two new sites.","Hollywood HEART: Arts in the HEART of the Classroom Budget

We have recently launched a major fundraising campaign to increase our school-based programming which complements this effort. We are expanding our partnerships with the entertainment industry to increase both financial support for our programs and mentoring and internship opportunities for our students. We do not envision going beyond three high schools at this time. Goals for the future include the addition of professional development for classroom teachers to institutionalize the integration of the arts into school curricula. We also anticipate extending the program to build a pathway for students into community and four-year colleges.
  
 There is extensive research supporting both the need and the potential impact for college-based programs. Recent studies have highlighted the fact that while the high school graduation rates for low-income and at-risk youth are improving, and more of these students are entering college, the college graduation rates for low-income students has remained essentially unchanged since 1970 at a dismal 20%. Studies have long supported the link between a sustained engagement in the arts and improved academic achievement and graduation rates at the high school level. Hollywood HEART proposes that we take advantage of this fact to improve college outcomes as well.
  
 Hollywood HEART is currently reaching out to community colleges who have targeted programs for first generation and low-income students to provide encouragement and support for our students who wish to continue working in art-related fields. We are also in preliminary discussions with a four-year college who has expressed an interest in launching a similar effort. Our initial programming will target students interested in career opportunities for “below the line” positions in film and television which aligns not only with our film and digital media workshops but also our culinary arts and fashion programs which translate easily to catering and costuming careers."

Instead of renting facilities out in different areas we want to create a space for the youth of all ages to come and enjoy a facility that caters to the LA Area. It will be a safe haven for children to come play basketball, receive proper training, gain knowledge on nutrition, and meet new people. It will be a facility that will give everyone in the community a chance to be involved. The facility will have two indoor basketball courts, strength and conditioning section, and homework area.","Traffic is a main concern and we understand parents have jobs as well. We will consider offering rides to students who want to attend but have no means of transportation.

5102175,Ignite Imaginations Access the World,2015113,,,"To develop a curriculum of interactive activities and workshops prior to our Children’s Concert Series, in partnership with other local arts organizations. that ignite the imaginations of children and their families. The activities and workshops will be coordinated with the acts performing on stage, showcasing the multiculturalism of LA, and expanding the awareness of other world cultures.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Levitt Pavilion Los Angeles (MacArthur Park); Levitt Pavilion Pasadena (Memorial Park),ALL,"Levitt Pavilion Greater Los Angeles & Pasadena envisions an LA2050 in which the community as a whole—parents, children, young adults, seniors—comes together to play in welcoming outdoor settings to experience the joy of arts experiences open to all. We believe that access to high quality arts experiences shouldn’t be reserved for those who can afford to buy tickets, but should be made available to everyone. Each summer over 100,000 Angelenos of all ages and backgrounds enjoy 100+ free concerts at Levitt Los Angeles in MacArthur Park, and Levitt Pasadena in Memorial Park, adding vitality to public spaces that were once neglected and nurturing an appreciation for the arts in this great city we call home. 
 
 However, in the wake of drastic funding cuts to arts education in Los Angeles-area public schools, Levitt believes we could – and must – do more. Tens of thousands of youth are missing out on opportunities to engage more deeply with the arts, compromising an invaluable part of their overall growth as individuals and members of society. Levitt proposes to help fill this void by enhancing Levitt LA and Levitt Pasadena’s popular free children’s concerts with a series of free, hands-on interactive workshops before each children’s show, designed to ignite imaginations and expand the awareness of the multiculturalism of LA and other world cultures. 
 
 The My LA 2050 grant will give Levitt the opportunity to extend and deepen children’s art experiences through weekly pre-concert workshops from late June through August 2016. These hour-long interactive workshops will be taught by highly skilled teaching artists in a welcoming and supportive environment, and coordinated with a community partner and the acts onstage to highlight the cultural significance of the days performance. Through making an instrument, trying out cultural dances, creating murals, learning a new song of another culture and singing along with others, we envision each workshop will engage the imagination and offer a fun and hands-on way for children to experience the joy of creating and experiencing music of various cultures in a communal setting. 
 
 Both Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena have had incredible success with the children’s series presented as part of the overall Levitt concert seasons. Based upon the attendance at the children’s programs in previous years, we anticipate that approximately 20,000 Los Angeles children will benefit from this program in 2016.","While our Children’s Concerts are well attended, one of our major challenges will be getting the word out to the community that the new workshops and activities being presented are a new addition to the existing program. Because our concerts are during the summer, we have the challenge of engaging families before the end of the school year. As part of our overall marketing strategy, we plan to disseminate information to the local schools prior to the end of the school year.
 
 Local residents currently frequent the parks on a regular basis, however, our other major challenge will be to bring people from beyond the local community to our shows. With a particular history of neglect, this is especially true at our MacArthur Park venue. 
 
 We will overcome these challenges by developing a comprehensive marketing strategy that begins early. In addition, our extensive network of local media partners will be instrumental in our marketing efforts to reach a broad demographic.","We will evaluate the success of the program in the following key ways:
 First, we will measure the number of participants attending each of the 20 children’s concerts and the number of children attending the pre-concert workshops. 
 
 Additionally, following each children’s workshop, Levitt professional staff, workshop artists, and participating partners, will debrief and determine how to enhance participation, refine logistics and evaluate responses.
 
 Finally, to measure success in participation, we will collect the qualitative data from the surveys of participants. Levitt routinely collects random samples of audience surveys in both English and Spanish. This summer’s surveys will include questions about the new interactive activities and workshops for children and families, in order to receive reactions to the project and to measure its success. The surveys will be tallied and the results will be incorporated into a final report to be shared with the funder.","Levitt Pavilion is in a unique position in that we are the only organization to offer 100+ free concerts to the citizens of Los Angeles each year. While there are other organizations that present open-air performances as part of a summer series, such as the Hollywood Bowl, the Greek Theatre, and the John Anson Ford Amphitheater, what makes the Levitt program special is that all of our concerts and programs are always presented free of charge. Grand Performances may be considered our closest competitor, but what differentiates us from Grand Performances is our children’s programming. Levitt presents the largest free outdoor concert series in Los Angeles, with a regular and consistent (twice a week during the summer) children’s concert component.
  
 Levitt Pavilions has good working relationships with our sister presenting organizations, especially in the area of scheduling and booking. We work in a collaborative and complementary way with these organizations, including Grand Performances, Grand Park, Skirball, the Twilight Concert Series in Santa Monica, etc. Our success and the success of our “competitors” only help to build the awareness of and appreciation for the performing arts in Los Angeles.","We have established relationships with a number of arts organizations who are eager to work with us on this endeavor including LACMA, Zimmer Children’s Museum, KidSpace Museum, Armory Center for the Arts, LA Phil, PBS, iMusic Academy, Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), Pasadena Museum of Contemporary Art, Mus/ique, Korean Cultural Center - Los Angeles, Hearts of Los Angeles (HOLA), and Las Fotos Project. 
 
 We also have an extensive roster of contemporary and traditional artists, many of whom have performed at our stages in the past, that will be selected for this series. Artists chosen for this program range from acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists that represent the diversity of cultures that comprise Los Angeles. Examples include Oscar Award-winning Bob Baker Marionettes, Latin Grammy Award Winners Lucky Diaz & the Family Jam Band, Mariachi Los Castorcitos, Canada's only known children's Mariachi group, Tierra Blanca, Silk Road Dance Company, to name a few. 
 
 We are looking at Viver Brasil Dance Company, Blue13 Dance Company (Bollywood/Indian dance), Antics (multimedia hip-hop dance theater), Capoeira Batuque, CONTRA-TIEMPO (Urban Latin Dance Theater), KimBámbula Productions (Afro-Cuban dance/music), Khmer Arts Academy (Cambodian Classical Dance), Garifuna American Heritage Foundation United as possible collaborators as well. 
 
 Each professional Teaching Artist will receive $500 per workshop, and each Partner will receive $500 for their administrative part in the collaboration.","Artist Fees – Artists chosen for this program represent a wide variety of genres & cultures, ranging from acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists. = $1800 per concert.
 
 Teaching Artists and Partner Costs– The teaching artists will lead the interactive workshops developed specifically for the day, and Community Partners will present activities prior to the scheduled performance. Incorporating and highlighting the cultural significance of the music into the workshop and activities will be emphasized. Teaching artists =$500 per concert. Community Partner = $500 per concert.
 
 Sound & Lights: Sound and lights production of each concert will come to $750 per concert. This number is determined by Levitt’s experience of what the actual cost is for sound production in doing these shows. 
 Marketing and Promotion – The Levitt children’s programs are established and well attended. However, marketing and promotion will be paramount to make clear that the experiential workshops are a new addition to the existing program. We will create promotional materials in Spanish and English, and use street teams to distribute flyers and brochures. Radio advertisements will be made through KPCC, KCRW, and KPFK to promote this program to a wide audience. Flyers will be given to local community centers and schools. The program will be publicized on each local Levitt website, as well as email marketed . Marketing = $500 per show. 
 
 Supplies and Materials – Based upon attendance counts, supplies will be purchased for approximately 1,000 children at each concert to use in creating their arts experience. This may include purchasing instruments to distribute, such as recorders, flutaphones or portable drums, or purchasing materials to create shakers or puppets, etc. = $500 per show
 
 Administrative Oversight and Coordination – Staff at Levitt Pavilion Greater Los Angeles & Pasadena will ensure that the program meets the program objectives. We will be responsible for devising the program, hiring the teaching artists, engaging the Community Partners in creating activities, obtaining the materials required, and ensuring that the participating children’s experiences are fun, interesting and educational.

 Total: $101,000","For us, “Play” is a serious endeavor. Play is more than an opportunity to let loose, it is essential to childhood development and provides an open and free environment for children and adults alike to make mistakes, and to explore and engage with others.
  
 Our venues are not only directly accessible by train, but as parks, they are situated right in the middle of diverse communities. We hope to engage the people of these neighborhoods to help us activate our parks through play. 
  
 Initially, our attendance numbers and the data we collect from our surveys will measure our success. Access in itself is a major goal for this project, and providing the opportunity for a wide range of people, from our local communities to play through the arts is a feat on its own. However, the lasting success of our programs will be seen in the future, when the children that we engage in our parks become adults.
  
 Our hope is that through our efforts today, the next generation will appreciate the value of community spaces activated through shared arts experiences. The seeds planted today will hopefully grow into future investment in the arts. In 2050, all Angelenos will have ample opportunities to participate in high quality performing arts experiences. The citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be inspired by and appreciate how music and arts participation makes us all; more tolerant, innovative and engaged. This appreciation and understanding will play a prominent role in furthering Los Angeles as a center for diversity, culture and public engagement in the arts."
5102001,IHADLA: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty by Educating and Empowering Youth.,2015001,,,"Working in Boyle Heights, Watts, & Inglewood, IHADLA strives to break the cycle of poverty by sponsoring entire grade levels of 3rd graders from under-performing schools in low-income areas, providing them with the only long-term, comprehensive program of its kind in Los Angeles. For 10 years, “Dreamers” attend our in-school, after-school & summer programs that prepare them for academic & emotional success; each student is eligible for an $8,000 scholarship from us upon completing high school.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,"Sunrise Elementary School in Boyle Heights, 99th Street Elementary and Animo James B. Taylor in Watts, and multiple high schools in Inglewood",Learn,"Currently working with 65 third graders in Boyle Heights, 70 sixth graders in Watts, 120 ninth and tenth graders in Inglewood, and continuing to provide scholarships for 114 recent college graduates in Boyle Heights, IHADLA specifically chooses different program sites throughout Los Angeles so that we make the most impact possible across the county. By providing IHADLA’s unique programming to those children with the greatest needs, we are dramatically increasing their opportunity to succeed. Our Dreamers already contend with substandard living conditions, nutrition, and educational facilities, and IHADLA aims to fill these gaps and beyond with the understanding that a better life for these children means a better life for us all. It is our hope that, with the support of our comprehensive long-term program, our Dreamers will be able to raise not only themselves, but also their families, out of the cycle of poverty in which they have been living. 
 
 High school dropouts are found to be four times more likely to be unemployed, three and a half times more likely to be arrested, and more than eight times as likely to go to prison as their peers who complete their education. The higher graduation rates, increased opportunities and healthier lifestyles that IHADLA is working to provide these young people mean that they are less likely to dropout and rely upon the public welfare system. By beginning to work with a group of at-risk young people when they are in the third grade, and staying with those same students all the way through high school graduation and into college, IHADLA has a profound impact as they foster a college-going mind-set and a desire to dream big from a young age. This impact is evidenced by the fact that our most recent graduates, high school class of 2013, had graduation rates a full 25% higher than their LAUSD peers!
 
 Most of all, by supporting IHADLA, citizens of Los Angeles are making an investment in the future of Los Angeles county. The future innovators of science, technology, social science, etc. are standing before us in Boyle Heights, Watts, and Inglewood. They have extraordinary potential. However, most of their parents never finished high school, and even fewer still know what it’s like to earn above the poverty line. Who, if not IHADLA, will lead these children towards their dreams? To turn our backs on them would be to turn our backs on our own community, our economy, and a better future for all Los Angelinos.","This year brings the challenge of transitioning for all of our students. Our oldest Dreamers in Boyle Heights are navigating college while our Dreamers in Inglewood are starting high school and learning to balance academics, extra-curriculars, and college prep. In Watts, our Dreamers are beginning middle school, experiencing the hormonal changes of adolescence that often bring mood swings, social hardships , and mental health issues. Our newest 3rd grade Dreamers in Boyle Heights have just begun with us, and we are evaluating them for academic levels and mental health –we have identified numerous students high on the depression index and at least 15 students with a learning disability. To help our Dreamers through these difficult times, we are working to implement additional learning time and academic partners. We are also looking to increase mental health services, including partnering with counseling centers and employing our first full time MSW to be an advocate for Dreamers.","To ensure we are providing the most valuable support to our Dreamers, we employ a professional outside evaluator, Dr. Beth Manke of CSU Long Beach, to conduct evaluations every year, with a major evaluation every two to three years. These evaluations track statistics on our Dreamers’ grades, attendance, involvement in crime and drugs, pregnancies, mental health and familial discord.
 
 Our Program Coordinators (PC’s) also play a vital role in evaluation, as they continuously monitor academic performance through report cards, assignment completion, test scores, and teacher relationships. All Program Coordinators also complete Monthly Reports that detail activities of the previous month, tracking achievements and areas of needed improvement to ensure the effectiveness of the program. Each summer, Program Coordinators also conduct a home visit with each Dreamer and their family to assess any needs or concerns, using a case management approach to ensure Dreamers are always fully supported.","There are many organizations in Los Angeles that provide after school programs and academic assistance. However, we at IHADLA consider ourselves to be unique, with no direct competition, because we offer the only long-term “whole-child” program for underserved youth in Los Angeles. By “whole-child” we mean that while we are an educational charity at our core, we believe that no child can achieve success if there are deeper issues, or existing circumstances beyond their control. As such, we not only support our Dreamers academically, but we are also bringing them cultural, socio-emotional, and career preparedness services, working to ensure that all aspects of the child and his/her life are nurtured. All of our services are provided 100% free of charge to our Dreamers and their families.
  
 Some of our students come from abusive homes, some have witnessed murder, some have already lost the only people they loved – and though they may be surviving, they are struggling for answers, and for guidance. The reality is that if IHADLA is able to intervene while these children are young, the chance to change their outlook on life and raise their awareness of opportunities available to them increases exponentially. Simply providing homework help is not enough, helping different children every year does not ensure change, and picking out the most gifted children is simply unfair. The entire group of children needs to be case-managed and encouraged, and they all need to know that they have a positive influence that they can always go to for support and guidance.
 
 To build trust is the ultimate challenge and cannot be achieved without daily interaction and guidance. Consistency is a luxury that most of our Dreamers have not experienced. That is why IHADLA must be long-term and diverse in its programming, and must be focused on all Dreamers completing high school and earning a college degree. We are creating real and permanent change in the most disadvantaged communities. While we see test improvements, lowering of depression scores, and other positive results over the life of our program, our work with these at-risk youth is not complete until they have gone on to college, having benefited from more than ten years with our program. There is no other organization that so comprehensively prepares its students for higher education and for raising themselves and their communities out of poverty.","In order to provide the most effective programming, IHADLA partners with numerous community organizations in order to offer the highest level of service. While this grant is not being written in conjunction with another organization specifically, many of our partnerships do come at a cost to us. The following are our main partners this year. 
 - The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, one of the largest urban turnaround programs in the country, who we first worked with at 99th Street Elementary in Watts. After seeing the impact achieved by working with Partnership, we made every effort to work with them going forward, and chose Sunrise Elementary in Boyle Heights (a Partnership school) for our newest program.
 - Common Threads, an after-school cooking program that teaches skills and empowers children to make healthy choices.
 - Girls on the Run, a non-profit dedicated to teaching girls life skills and self-confidence, culminating in a 5k race for all participants. This costs us $1,100/year at our Boyle Heights site, and is being provided at no cost in Watts thanks to funding received by Girls on the Run that they have graciously utilized with us.
 - Many of our Dreamers struggle with mental health, and so we contract with Amanacer Counseling and the Maple Center, who work with families and Dreamers referred to them by IHADLA. The Maple Center also provides training for IHADLA staff. While there is no cost to families, and working with Amanacer is free to us, the cost to work with and refer to the Maple Center is $25,000 a year.
 - We work with two USC MSW interns who support our Dreamers with socio-emotional development, and this is the first year we are blessed to have a full time MSW as our new Program Manager. We contract a USC Social Work professor at $9,000/year to oversee/train all three individuals.
 - We are incredibly fortunate to receive numerous Human Development Department students from CSU Long Beach as interns who help with data work, tutoring and other office and program tasks.
 - Through a relationship with one of our Board members, we are lucky to have numerous FBI agents and staff as mentors for our Dreamers.
 - Originally developed in Israel, the Perach program pairs a Dreamer with a university student for a program of tutoring and mentoring. There is no cost this year as are piloting the program with one mentor who is one of our MSW interns, but we are hoping to expand the program next year, which would cost $3,000 per year per mentor.","We currently have five active programs running in the greater Los Angeles area. These include our newest program of 65 3rd graders at Sunrise Elementary School in Boyle Heights; 70 6th graders who begun with us at 99th Street Elementary School in Watts in the 3rd grade; 120 9th and 10th graders in Inglewood who are from two programs we sponsored in back to back years at Daniel Freeman Elementary School when they were respectively in the 1st grade; and 114 recent high school graduates who began with us in the 3rd grade at Murchison Elementary School in Boyle Heights and who we continue to support through scholarships. The cost to us to run all three of these programs for this year will be $691,988 – this does not include the cost of our Executive Office or Fundraising.
 
 In order to cover the costs of the additional $591,988, we will seek and renew funding from existing annual and multi-year foundation, individual and corporate donors, expanding our funding pipeline to include additional organizations and individuals. Diligent stewardship, creative cultivation and a strong marketing and social media presence will all assist us in reaching our goal. In addition, we will continue to hold a series of events, including our annual fundraiser, the Dreamer Dinner, which in addition to raising money through sponsorship and ticket sales, has proven to be an excellent way to cultivate new individual donors, paving the way for future donations. We will also hold a series of smaller fundraisers such as cultivation lunches, bingo nights, raffles, and holiday parties. Alongside our Executive Office staff, we are blessed with a strong board who will also assist with fundraising efforts including cultivation and contribution. 
 
 Also, due to the long-term nature of our programs, and the fact that the organization used to be a sponsorship model (something we shifted away from four years ago), we fundraised upfront and have investments for our two programs in Inglewood and our program in Watts. We are running down the restricted balances on these investments while continuing the fundraising needed to complete the ten year commitment we made to these programs and students. While we have large funding needs for all of our current programs, we are especially seeking funding for our newest program at Sunrise Elementary, as we have the greatest commitment to them, having pledged to work with them and support them through their 2025 high school graduation and on into college.","We would use this funding for all direct program expenses for our current programs this year, which would help immensely in getting us to our goal of funding a new program every other year.
 - $17,281 in program supplies
 - $23,550 in travel (i.e. transportation for field trips/college visits)
 - $10,370 in meals/food (this is healthy snacks for Dreamers every day, as well as breakfast/lunch for high school Dreamers at Saturday Academy & food on field trips)
 This totals $51,201, leaving a remainder of $48,799, which we would put towards salaries of direct program staff (6 full time Program Coordinators & 4 part time Program Assistants). Their salaries total $358,164, meaning that this gracious donation would allow us to fund just over 13% of their salaries. We see this to be a program cost, as they are our program – they are teachers, mentors, case managers, confidantes, & pillars of strength for our Dreamers for over 10 years, & they are the reason that our program is so effective.","Now in our 29th year of operation in the Los Angeles area, we have a successful track record of affecting change & making a positive impact. Of our most recent graduating class (Boyle Heights, class of 2013), 86% of our Dreamers graduated from high school, & of that, 96% went on to some form of higher education. This rate is approximately 25% higher than the average for LAUSD. It is our goal to be able to have this same impact, if not greater, on all of our current and future classes of Dreamers.
 
 By consistently increasing the classes we are able to sponsor, we also aim to make a sustainable impact on Los Angeles as a whole. We have seen first hand the positive effect one Dreamer can have on those around them, & so although we directly support hundreds of Dreamers, we indirectly support hundreds more who benefit from the effects of our program. Parents are able to attend workshops on financial planning & on how to support their children academically. Siblings & other students are always invited to join events & programs as space becomes available. The futures of many are altered for the better as Dreamers’ siblings & friends begin to see college as a real option after looking to our Dreamers as models.
 
 Having shifted approximately three years ago from a sponsorship model in which a major donor or private foundation typically would agree upfront to fund an entire program, we are now focused, as mentioned above, on a more traditional fundraising model across multiple income streams. As we build our fundraising strength, it is our goal to be able to offer our unique, comprehensive, invaluable programming to more & more students each year. With this in mind, we have a strategic goal of being able to sponsor a new class of third graders every other year, working in community clusters in an effort to bring about the most positive change possible. To this effect, we hope, in the near future, to be able to establish a resource center from which we could conduct all of our programming.
 
 We aim to achieve this growth by focusing on growing our fundraising & income as well as by increasing the community partners with whom we are able to work. By growing our marketing & brand awareness, ramping up our online presence, and making ourselves known throughout LA county, we hope to increase the number of people & organizations desiring to work with us in helping to make dreams come true as we aim to raise the disadvantaged youth we serve out of poverty."

South LAs Silicon Valley!,2015129,,,LASC Foundation partnered with Innovate Globally to create a synergistic program that accomplishes the following three goals: 1) educate students and South Los Angeles residents on the highly marketable skill of coding; 2) support business entrepreneurship by providing students and community members with “soup to nuts” business instruction and industry exposure for tech-related start-ups; and 3) ultimately create a sustainable “Innovation Ecosystem” that will encourage indigenous creativity.,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,Los Angeles Southwest College,Learn,"LASC Foundation, in partnership with Innovate Globally and LASC’s Career and Technical Education School seek to create a “tech hub” in South Los Angeles. 
 1. Students are offered the Introduction to Innovation 72 (I2 I), a 6-week, non-credit class at LASC CTE. The course is an introduction to the core components of the Innov8 program—CodeTechIQ, DigiTechIQ and BizTechIQ. 
 a. CodeTechIQ—students are taught the “back-end of innovation”. They are provided with an introduction to computer coding, as well as a look at how coding is used in industry (web-based, mobile, gaming and other industries). 
 b. DigiTechIQ—students are taught “what drives innovation”. They are instructed on content creation (digital media, web and graphic design, infographics, etc.).
 c.  BizTechIQ—students are taught the “front end” of innovation”. They are given the skills to manage a tech start up. The students get lessons in project management, securing funding, making the pitch and overall business development. 
 2. I2I enables the student to determine their area of interest—Code, Digi or BizTech. Students are then put on an education track with more in-depth introductory course work in their area of interest. Upon completion of one semester of classes, the student receives a Certificate of Knowledge.
 3. The students will then be placed in an 8-12 week internship with an Innov8 industry partner. The student gives the students the opportunity to get hands-on experience and continued education in a real-world work environment.
 4. The students’ for-credit coursework at LASC CTE. The student earns a Certificate of Skill. 
 5. Students are eligible to participate in a Preceptorship—the opportunity to work with a Fast 5 team (coder, digi-technician, BizTech manager, a Masters Level Student from local University and an Industry Expert) to work with local entrepreneurs on a tech start- up. This is exciting for two reasons: a) it provides local entrepreneurs access to significantly discounted development expertise, helping to launch a successful tech-based business and b) it provides the Innov8 students the opportunity to get hands-on experience on launching a start-up, as well as projects to add to their professional portfolios.
 6. Students are recommended to complete three Preceptorships. The students now have three options: a) four-year degree; b) employment in the tech industry with work experience and impressive portfolios; or c) launch their own start-up.","One anticipated challenge is institutionalizing the Innov8 Program into the Los Angeles Southwest College official, for-credit education track. LASC Foundation is working closely with the Dean of CTE to identify and address all of the requirements. Moreover, another challenge is getting industry representatives to participate. LASC Foundation and Innovate Globally have made tremendous inroads by hosting the nationally recognized Start-Up weekend at LASC in September 2015. The event, sponsored by Google had representatives from dozens of tech companies. Individuals came from many states Successful individuals were assigned a Fast 5 team that helped them to develop their product over the weekend. LASC Foundation build upon the relationships developed while hosting this extraordinary event. Finally, communities of color are the biggest consumers of entertaining technology; but very few creators. Innov8 seeks to move South LA from consumers to creators.","Innov8 will use a variety of evaluative tools. These include, but are not limited to the following: 
 • Number of students enrolled and % that complete classes.
 • Student surveys/questionnaires
 • LASC Institutional Effectiveness department gathers data on all classes taught on campus
 • Number of corporate partners secured for instruction and internships
 • Number of students successfully placed in internships and preceptorships; % complete
 • Number of students enrolled in four year university
 • Number of students placed in viable job
 • Number of students that launch a tech start-up","There are organizations that are doing portions of our program, but not any combine the education and business development like Innov8. 
 
 One of the more famous coding programs is Yes We Code, founded by Van Jones that provides coding instruction for underserved youth. The #YesWeCode initiative targets low-opportunity youth and provides them with the necessary resources and tools to become world-class computer programmers. By learning this highly valuable and relevant 21st century skill, these young people are shifting the trajectory of their futures and transforming their relationships with their communities and their country. 
 
 There are programs that provide entrepreneurial training for teachers. In partnership with the LAUSD and with school districts in Culver City, Downey, and Hawthorne, NFTE Los Angeles Metro trains teachers to engage students from low-income communities as entrepreneurial thinkers using our innovative, hands-on curriculum. Since its opening in 2007, NFTE Los Angeles Metro has provided over 12,000 students with the tools and mindset necessary to prepare for successful futures in school, college and the workforce. There are a myriad of schools that provide training on digital technology. 
 
 However, Innov8 is unique in that we strive to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that fosters continual education, connected to business opportunity, connected to South Los Angeles. Innov8 seeks to bring the educational and economic dynamism that is found in the Silicon Valley into South Los Angeles. The benefits to the community will include: career awareness, valuable and marketable skills development; entrepreneurial opportunity; work experience and job placement; and the hope of becoming the Southern California tech destination!","There are three primary partners on the project—LASC Foundation, Innovate Globally and LASC CTE. Below is a brief description of roles, responsibilities and compensation:
 
 LASC Foundation is the Project Director and will be fiscally responsible for the project. The LASC Foundation will be responsible project compliance, fiscal management, identifying and recruiting business partners and facilitating interaction between interactions with the LASC campus. LASC will receive $50,000 of the funds.
 
 Innovate Globally is the Education and Program Coordinator. They are responsible for curriculum development, instruction, educational coordination with LASC, and overseeing internship and preceptorship placements. Innovate Globally will receive $50,000
 
 LASC CTE will work with the program to shepherd the project through the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) curriculum approval process to ensure the class is approved to issue certificates. LASC CTE will also make classroom and presentation space available to the program. LASC CTE is an uncompensated partner.","The Innov8 full program budget is $280,000 for the first full year. Additional cost will be covered through various fundraising activities such as: grant writing, individual donors, corporate sponsorship, events and online donor campaigns.","Anticipated budget:
 Staff and Contractors--$60,000
 Equipment--$20,000
 Marketing--$10,000
 Event--$10,000","Innov8 will document our development process with hopes of initial increasing the number of students at LASC. Once the program is successfully implemented and integrated into the LASC approved certificated list of programs, Innov8 seeks to expand the program to the other eight colleges in LACCD. Ultimately, we hope to package and license the curriculum, making it available to community colleges throughout the state and nation as a social enterprise."
5102145,Inspiring Girls in Technology Entrepreneurship,2015094,,,Offer the opportunity to young girls to develop technology and entrepreneurship skills through Technovation's open source curriculum and professional mentorship.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Technovation gives girls the opportunity to create mobile apps to solve problems in their community. Through this program young girls will develop their technical and entrepreneurial skills while creating solutions for local communities. In creating local app solutions for local problems, young girls in LA can possibly discover the next big start-up idea. 
 
 girls get to create cool app ideas through Technovation in the following way:
 Teams of middle school and high school girls work together to complete an intensive, 50-hour curriculum. The girls are supported by a teacher (or after-school coordinator) and paired with a mentor who is a female tech professional. The curriculum is open, online and freely accessible to all. Through the program, the girls learn to:
 1. Identify a problem in their community: Girls work in teams and identify an idea for a mobile app that will help solve a problem in their community
 2. Program an app: Teams develop the actual app using a visual, block-based language called App Inventor (developed by MIT) that requires no prior knowledge of programming.
 3. Develop and deliver a pitch: Teams develop a business plan, videotape and submit their app and demo pitches for review.
 Ten finalist teams are then be chosen and flown out to Silicon Valley to pitch their apps and business plans to potential investors. The winning teams are awarded $20,000 in seed funding to take their app to market.
 
 The program will kick-off with a Girls make App Day workshop where all teams will meet with their mentors and attend a workshop focussed on the app Inventor platform. All local teams will have the opportunity to present their app ideas at the Regional Pitch event. the winning team will also have the opportunity to visit San Francisco for the World Pitch event, event if they are not selected in the top 10.","We anticipate two major challenges for this program. We aim to reach to the under-served sections of the community. Convincing parents and students from this community to register for the program may be challenging. We hope to overcome this challenge by involving students from previous Technovation seasons as our spokespersons to share their personal experiences. We hope that personal stories from the same demographic group will inspire the girls to the value of this opportunity.
 We also anticipate the possibility of not finding adequate number of mentors to guide local teams. Since our program is global and many are mentored visually, we hope to connect local teams with mentors from across U.S. and other countries through our platform.","All participants, mentors, teachers and students, are required to submit pre and post-program surveys. Results from these surveys help identify the learning goals of the girls and assess impact of the program on these goals.
 Anecdotal evidence gathered through case studies will also help to measure impact.","Given the low number of women in tech careers, there are many program focused on programming education to youth. We see organizations working with youth, such as Girls Scouts, Peace Corps, UN Women and UNESCO, as our distribution partners. We work with these organizations to offer Technovation as a potential youth program for their members/target audience. Technovation is the only GLOBAL program for GIRLS that combines problem solving with technical and entrepreneurial skills in one program. 
 Technovation is unique in the following ways:
 1. It combines technology and entrepreneurship. Our curriculum encourages girls to identify a problem in their community and create an app to solve it. So the girls directly identify and define the problem they are working on. Through our curriculum, girls develop problem solving, public speaking and other essential life skills.
 2. The mentoring component allows the girls to connect with role models and develop lifelong relationships. 
 3. Technovation mentors themselves gain job-related skills of mobile app development, entrepreneurship and leadership.","Iridescent aims to work with local schools and organizations to identify the high needs students. A Technovation Regional Ambassador will work with local schools on student outreach. The Regional Ambassador will recruit schools teachers as Technovation coaches, who will help to facilitate team sessions. Professionals from local companies are expected to volunteer time to mentor the girls and walk them through the Technovation curriculum. 
 
 Iridescent’s curriculum is free and open, we do not anticipate huge costs in implementing the program. The Regional ambassador will receive a monthly stipend for managing the program on the ground. Teachers and mentors are expected to volunteer their time.",100000,"Technovation Budget:

For the 2016 season, we are hoping to expand to new countries and scale in existing ones. This grant will allow us to offer the program to more girls in LA area. We will have the resources to support the girls through a Regional Ambassador and largely local mentors, thereby improving the quality of the program.
 Technovation model is easy to replicate and scale. With an online curriculum and option of in-person or virtual mentoring, teachers or students in any part of the world can create teams and participate in the competition.
 For the 2017 cycle, we hope to recruit the participants from the 2016 cycle as student ambassadors to help with outreach and support for future teams. 
 We recently launched a platform to involve Technovation Alumnae in scaling the program. SprEdTech, created by Amrita Venkatraman, a Technovation alumnae, is an initiative to encourage girls (grade 6 to grade 12) to develop an early interest in technology. Technovation alumnae are encouraged to become ambassadors through SprEdTech and spread the word about using coding and technology to create innovative products. Ambassadors will recruit and mentor future Technovation teams, lead technology workshops, and much more!"

By teaching and inspiring girls to be interested in coding and giving them the skills to face life’s challenges we are preparing girls to become successful professionals in computer science fields. Girls Inc. takes a comprehensive approach to working with girls with the ultimate goal of on time graduation from high school and the tools needed to attend and graduate from a four year college. Collaborating with Whiz Girls to give the girls the tools to learn coding and stay interested in technology will produce strong, educated and entrepreneurial women. 
 To double our impact, not only will we teach coding and entrepreneurship to inner city middle school and high school girls through our healthy balanced lifestyle way of life including meditation/yoga, etc, We will empower teachers and train them with WhizGirls Academy curriculum as well.Our goal is to empower these girls with entrepreneurship skills and create empowered leaders. Essentially we are fostering the girls and giving them the digital skills to survive and thrive in the digital age that we live in. And most importantly we are creating the pipeline of future female tech founders by training them at an early age.","Working with girls from vulnerable communities brings the challenge of working with girls who have not had the same exposure to technology as their counterparts in wealthier communities. The education gap will be addressed by utilizing age appropriate, fun activities that break coding down into easily understable lessons. Having trained, professional staff and volunteers working with the girls creates a safe, all-girl environment which promotes learning. At WhizGirls Academy, our challenges have been hiring full time teachers that know how to code and feel comfortable with technology.","The effectiveness of the program will be measured by pre-surveys, post-surveys, and a follow-up survey one year after participation. Evaluation results will help us:
 Monitor girls’ knowledge and skills as they progress through the program.
 Tailor our programming to fit the needs of girls.
 Report to funders about our progress. 
 Keep in touch with alumnae as they enter college and the workforce.","There are no other organizations taking a holistic approach to meet the needs of girls. Girls Inc. addresses these needs and delivers age appropriate programming from 1st through 12th grade. WhizGirls Academy also takes a holistic approach, not only teaching coding but also incorporating physical activity and meditation to support a well rounded experience.","Girls Inc LA and WhizGirls Academy will collaborate and will equally receive $50,000 to implement the project.","The cost of the Girls Inc. program for this project is $133,000.

To encourage students to develop their English & Language Arts skills and creative learning behaviors that encourage lifelong learning, L.A. must first show our youngest citizens that these skills matter, that their voices are important, and that their stories are valued. By identifying their stories and helping them share those stories publicly through writing, 826LA and Young Storytellers will empower young people to increase their literacy skills through meaningful self-expression. Students will gain important communication skills that will help them succeed beyond school as confident, engaged members of their community. Last year, 95% of students reported that working with 826LA in their classrooms helped them increase their confidence about writing, and 90% of teachers reported a marked improvement in their students' writing skills as the result of an 826LA project. In the 2014 school year, 97% of Young Storytellers mentors observed a growth in their writer’s ability to think creatively, 98% of mentors observed a growth in their writer’s confidence, and 88% of parents noticed an improvement in the creativity of their children.
 
 Through this project, 826LA and Young Storytellers will partner with local Title I LAUSD schools and teachers to help 2,000 severely disadvantaged students to write their stories. Through a variety of storytelling mediums including but not limited to personal essay, fiction, graphic novels, and screenplays, 826LA and Young Storytellers will provide a safe space for students to develop their literacy skills and give them a platform to share their stories with the world. To help develop the next generation of storytellers, some of today’s entertainment professionals including writers, artists, producers, and filmmakers will mentor students as they write and edit their stories. The culmination of this project will be a book, jointly published by 826LA and Young Storytellers, collecting stories written by students for wide distribution. 826LA and Young Storytellers will celebrate the publication of this book during a public event. Featuring students reading their own words and professional actors dramatizing their screenplays, this public event will provide both a figurative and a literal stage for students to share their stories.","826LA and Young Storytellers rely on specially trained volunteers, many of who are writers, artists, and creative professionals, to support students. While projects during school hours enables these organizations to reach high needs students, it can be a challenge to engage volunteers during regular school hours. To overcome this obstacle, 826LA and Young Storytellers plans to engage corporate volunteers from the entertainment industry to mentor the next generation of storytellers. These organizations have existing partnerships with Bad Robot, Disney, Sony Pictures, Participant Media, Verve, HBO, and AEG and will draw upon these partnerships and others to provide support for students. Exposure to the entertainment industry is often minimal or nonexistent in underserved communities, despite this industry’s role as a major economic force in California. These partnerships will not only make this project more viable, but will also grow the social capital of the students involved.","826LA and Young Storytellers aim to serve 2,000 students total from Title I LAUSD schools (1,000 students per organization). To evaluate the effectiveness of this project, the organizations will track the number of students served as well as the overall effectiveness of the writing support. 826LA will track its effectiveness using qualitative and quantitative surveys for students and teachers. Young Storytellers’ evaluation approach takes two distinct forms: Outcome and Process Evaluation.","In Los Angeles, there are other organizations including Write Girl and Get Lit that use creative writing to empower students, but 826LA and Young Storytellers will uniquely focus on storytelling and mentoring to help students find their voice and to express that voice with creativity and confidence. 826LA and Young Storytellers have different but complimentary core competencies, which they will bring to the project. Young Storytellers, for example, excels in bringing students’ writing to life through performance of student work by professional actors (on stage and film), whereas 826LA showcases student writing in over 250 publications each year. Both organizations have more than ten years of experience bringing specially trained, creative volunteers into public schools to support students and teachers at no cost to the school.","826LA and Young Storytellers will collaborate on this project, dividing the grant evenly between each organization.

As a result, the organizations will be able to increase their volunteer partnerships, attracting more volunteers to support projects like this. The organizations will also be able to use the publication as tools for engaging more school partnerships, increasing their reach in Los Angeles. 826LA aims to increase the number of students served through its in-school program by 36% over the next three years.

Through this program young girls will develop their technical and entrepreneurial skills while creating solutions for local communities. In creating local app solutions for local problems, young girls in LA can possibly discover the next big start-up idea. 
 
 girls get to create cool app ideas through Technovation in the following way:
 Teams of middle school and high school girls work together to complete an intensive, 50-hour curriculum. The girls are supported by a teacher (or after-school coordinator) and paired with a mentor who is a female tech professional. The curriculum is open, online and freely accessible to all. Through the program, the girls learn to:
 1. Identify a problem in their community: Girls work in teams and identify an idea for a mobile app that will help solve a problem in their community
 2. Program an app: Teams develop the actual app using a visual, block-based language called App Inventor (developed by MIT) that requires no prior knowledge of programming.
 3. Develop and deliver a pitch: Teams develop a business plan, videotape and submit their app and demo pitches for review.
 Ten finalist teams are then be chosen and flown out to Silicon Valley to pitch their apps and business plans to potential investors. The winning teams are awarded $20,000 in seed funding to take their app to market.
 
 The program will kick-off with a Girls make App Day workshop where all teams will meet with their mentors and attend a workshop focussed on the app Inventor platform. All local teams will have the opportunity to present their app ideas at the Regional Pitch event. the winning team will also have the opportunity to visit San Francisco for the World Pitch event, event if they are not selected in the top 10.","We anticipate two major challenges for this program. We aim to reach to the under-served sections of the community. Convincing parents and students from this community to register for the program may be challenging. We hope to overcome this challenge by involving students from previous Technovation seasons as our spokespersons to share their personal experiences. We hope that personal stories from the same demographic group will inspire the girls to the value of this opportunity.
 We also anticipate the possibility of not finding adequate number of mentors to guide local teams. Since our program is global and many are mentored visually, we hope to connect local teams with mentors from across U.S. and other countries through our platform.","All participants, mentors, teachers and students, are required to submit pre and post-program surveys. Results from these surveys help identify the learning goals of the girls and assess impact of the program on these goals.
 Anecdotal evidence gathered through case studies will also help to measure impact.","Given the low number of women in tech careers, there are many program focused on programming education to youth. We see organizations working with youth, such as Girls Scouts, Peace Corps, UN Women and UNESCO, as our distribution partners. We work with these organizations to offer Technovation as a potential youth program for their members/target audience. Technovation is the only GLOBAL program for GIRLS that combines problem solving with technical and entrepreneurial skills in one program. 
 Technovation is unique in the following ways:
 1. It combines technology and entrepreneurship. Our curriculum encourages girls to identify a problem in their community and create an app to solve it. So the girls directly identify and define the problem they are working on. Through our curriculum, girls develop problem solving, public speaking and other essential life skills.
 2. The mentoring component allows the girls to connect with role models and develop lifelong relationships. 
 3. Technovation mentors themselves gain job-related skills of mobile app development, entrepreneurship and leadership.","Iridescent aims to work with local schools and organizations to identify the high needs students. A Technovation Regional Ambassador will work with local schools on student outreach. The Regional Ambassador will recruit schools teachers as Technovation coaches, who will help to facilitate team sessions. Professionals from local companies are expected to volunteer time to mentor the girls and walk them through the Technovation curriculum. 
 
 Iridescent’s curriculum is free and open, we do not anticipate huge costs in implementing the program. The Regional ambassador will receive a monthly stipend for managing the program on the ground. Teachers and mentors are expected to volunteer their time.",100000,"Technovation Budget:

We will have the resources to support the girls through a Regional Ambassador and largely local mentors, thereby improving the quality of the program.
 Technovation model is easy to replicate and scale. With an online curriculum and option of in-person or virtual mentoring, teachers or students in any part of the world can create teams and participate in the competition.
 For the 2017 cycle, we hope to recruit the participants from the 2016 cycle as student ambassadors to help with outreach and support for future teams. 
 We recently launched a platform to involve Technovation Alumnae in scaling the program. SprEdTech, created by Amrita Venkatraman, a Technovation alumnae, is an initiative to encourage girls (grade 6 to grade 12) to develop an early interest in technology. Technovation alumnae are encouraged to become ambassadors through SprEdTech and spread the word about using coding and technology to create innovative products.

Creating interactions within the community about what it is and what it was, will enable residents to view Elysian Valley in the context of Los Angeles history, and empower them to actively shape what it will be by fully engaging in civic dialog about new development.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"North East LA/Elysian Valley (Frogtown), Dorris Place Elemenary, Allesandro Elementary",Learn,"Walking down any street in Elysian Valley, one finds vegetable gardens overflowing with Chinese Winter Melon, families eating in front yards laden with fruit trees. Residents stroll along the river from first light to sunset. New development and aggressive purchasing of properties threatens to turn this unique collection of avenues into a non-descript, ‘riverfront’ destination. The sudden rise in land values has led to predatory real estate practices as individuals and corporations attempt to purchase multiple parcels. While some are happy to cash out, those who want to stay feel under siege. Homes, apartments, and family owned businesses are being swallowed up by market-rate, multi-use development offering the minimum affordable housing mandated by the city. Although growth is inevitable, this is an impersonal process of displacement. 
 While tales of gentrification provide a common story for many neighborhoods, none are as vulnerable as the tiny community of Elysian Valley, aka Frogtown. Comprised of fewer than 8,000 residents, this historically low-income collection of cul-de-sacs lost its connection to the larger Los Angeles community decades ago with the destruction of Chavez Ravine and the building of the I-5 Freeway.
 Through Is.Was.Will Be., Smart Gals seeks to document these rapid-fire changes, educate the public and residents about Elysian Valley history, highlight long term residents and put faces and histories to the “parcels” that developers aim to acquire. The objective is to empower the neighborhood so that residents can fully participate in the civic process, have their voices heard by local government, and influence development.
 This project will implement a system for interaction and documentation that simultaneously informs and empowers the community, enabling residents to engage fully in civic dialog about their neighborhood. Documentation processes will include formal interviews with long-term residents (some of whom are survivors of the Chavez Ravine displacement), collection of personal archival from residents, and formal assembly of an accessible archive that tells the story of the neighborhood. Smart Gals would attempt to bring this history and these interviews into local schools so that the youth of the neighborhood can learn to observe and critique the changes happening around them. 
 By sharing our methods, successes and failures, we aim to provide a template for other neighborhoods to document, enrich and empower their community.","Connecting with long-term residents: Many of the residents have no internet access. We will partner with local activist/Neighborhood Watch organizer who has longstanding relationships within the community.
 
 Language Barriers: Many of the elderly residents speak Cantonese, Tagalog or Spanish, and very little English. We will partner with the younger generation of their families to engage in personal translation to ensure these stories are told and understood.
 
 Legal Assistance with Aggressive Investors: Most of the interest in the neighborhood currently stems from profit-driven models aiming to build riverfront strip; many in the community already feels let down by local representatives and city government. Residents need to be fully informed of their rights as property owners, renters and members of a community as they face this overwhelming development.","We will gauge the success of our work primarily by the number of stories successfully collected, the number of local lives documented, whether by ourselves directly or by local youth. Motivating families to invest in their own stories is a key objective.
 We will set a realistic goal for percentage of residents interviewed. To be effective in one year’s time, we will begin with those who are willing to speak with us, or who have already happily shared their stories (for which only the audio has been recorded) with the neighborhood newsletter. We will conduct these interviews on camera. If interviews are not granted we will attempt to photograph them with their homes and create a written summary.
 We will make presentations of neighborhood history and development to the local elementary schools that will teach students observation and documentation skills so they may conduct their own interviews and create family histories to add to the projects’ archival database.","There are a few well-funded organizations such as Storycorps whose mission mirrors our own, and news investigative outlets such as Marketplace (KUSC), which recently produced an in-depth series on gentrification in Los Angeles, but we aim to combine the collection of stories with direct neighborhood empowerment. In doing so, we look to complementary organizations devoted to local activism such as Mothers of East L.A. (MELA) and the Comité de la Esperanza that have successfully activated the Boyle Heights community and contribute meaningfully to the conversations about race, class and gentrification in our communities.
 While there are many new organizations focused on the Los Angeles River and surrounding neighborhoods, but most are profit-centered design and development companies. Our efforts are entirely people-centered.
 Our project is unique because we will portray the ""whole"" by way of focusing on the individual, thus telling a story that is inherently unique. 
 Due to the modest size and predominant poverty of the neighborhood, development in Elysian Valley may come less like gradual progress and more like a flash flood. Between anxious investors and the recently discovered ‘secret’ plans for Frank Gehry to formalize plans for the river development, it may be too late to slow the tide of gentrification in Elysian Valley. And yet, by learning what is here, what we might lose, and seeing what we’ve already lost, we will create a historical record that honors the purest idea of community.","We will partner with writer and historian Hadley Meares (KCET Departures, http://www.kcet.org/user/profile/hmeares) to guide the process of creating an in-depth, comprehensive historical profile of Elysian Valley. Estimated budget for professional research hours: $5,000.
 We will also partner with long-term resident David De La Torre who publishes the neighborhood newsletter, oversees Elysian Valley Neighborhood Watch (EVNW) and has worked tirelessly as an individual to positively influence the changes coming to the community. Estimated budget for connection, interview and planning hours: $10,000.
 Smart Gals Artistic Director, Christine Louise Mills, recently completed the feature documentary East L.A. Interchange, which chronicles the cultural history Boyle Heights and gentrification issues facing the community today. In her role as writer, editor and producer, Ms. Mills has made connections with individuals and organizations such as the Roybal Foundation, whom she will approach to bring aboard as members of an advisory board. Positions on the advisory board will be voluntary and not incur direct cost.","More funding translates directly into more hours put into the project, multiplying the number of stories told, ensuring a comprehensive portrait of the neighborhood. Less funding would simply mean a smaller sampling of interviews, fewer hours available to catch this community already in flux. We would focus on alternative, affordable storytelling systems such as the process of teaching elementary school children to document their own homes and families. 
 Is.Was.Will Be. could feasibly be done on a largely volunteer basis, but could not achieve the scope or immediacy necessary to be effective in one year’s time. Residents already feel Elysian Valley is “chasing its tail” in regards to development and having a genuine voice in the process. Full funding would be necessary to get the project up to speed if we hope to accurately document the changes that have already begun.
 Smart Gals would seek additional support from the Elysian Valley Neighborhood Council, members, volunteers, and other appropriate venues.","Research Hours (Including Hadley Meares): $7,000

In response, we have undertaken an ambitious research project in partnership with Georgetown University to evaluate our retreats. Our research findings will be used to create a replicable Retreat Model that organizations can implement and offer to survivors, the healing professionals who serve them, and communities beyond our current capacity and scope.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"The domestic violence and sexual assault service provider community currently faces an unprecedented challenge in effectively helping survivors understand and heal from the trauma that they have endured. The challenge is twofold: there is a void in access to and training for services that holistically address a survivor's mind, body and spirit in order to activate long-term change. And, for the past forty years, the field has been so entrenched in meeting the immediate needs of survivors with limited resources and support that staff are themselves suffering from high levels of vicarious trauma. A 2009 study in Violence Against Women found that 70% of participating domestic violence advocates met the criteria for clinical levels of post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, despite extensive personal sacrifice from front line workers in the field, the services that survivors receive fail to meet the overwhelming need in both volume and quality. This challenge has been amplified in Los Angeles, where in just the last year alone, the LAPD announced that reports of sexual assault had increased by 21% and domestic violence incidents had increased by 33%.
  
 Joyful Heart Foundation's four-day retreat is designed to restore participants' central nervous systems by addressing the physical, emotional and psychological impact of trauma, reducing the short and long term effects of this trauma, and ultimately laying the groundwork for participants to create healthy, permanent change in their own lives. Retreats are separately offered to survivors and healing professionals. The retreat offers 16 key workshops that integrate traditional and alternative healing methods and provide survivors with tools they can implement themselves, post retreat. Survivors are provided with nourishing meals, bodywork, time for reflection, and space and direction to create their own action plans for change and healing. With support from LA2050, JHF will complete 2 survivor retreats that will be evaluated by Georgetown University (a retreat for healing professionals was held and evaluated last year as part of this project). The aim of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the retreat as a new approach to healing and as an evidence-informed model that organizations can bring to their staff and client populations. This project will make LA a better place to LIVE by promoting positive mental health outcomes, community resiliency and increased support for advocates in this work.","One of the key risks in research is participant drop out rate. Survivors lead dynamic lives and many times this translates into unpredictable schedules or the inability to maintain a consistent means of contact (changing addresses, phone numbers, etc.). We are meeting this challenge by recruiting over the minimum number of survivors for each retreat to take into consideration an unpredictable retention rate.
 
 Another significant challenge we foresee is that while many partner agencies have a strong interest in the model, this does not necessarily translate into their ability to shift resources, infrastructure and their approaches to effectively implement the model. We are addressing this challenge by conducting thorough Needs Assessments and by creating implementation plans that lay out the changes required to achieve successful implementation of this model.","The evaluation of the Retreat Model’s effectiveness will be led by Mary Ann Dutton, Ph.D., a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University. Dr. Dutton is a well-respected clinical psychologist and researcher with over 20 years of extensive experience in the areas of intimate partner violence and alternative healing practices. The evaluation will include standardized quantitative assessment measures that track levels of PTSD symptoms, stress related outcomes, and the acquisition of healing and wellness competencies: self-efficacy, positive self-concept, increased self-compassion, healthy coping skills, decreased isolation, and increased connection among program participants. Qualitative assessments will target patterns of isolation and physical health factors that directly relate to survivors' abilities to access support from family, friends and community. Assessments will be captured in data collection periods: 2 weeks prior to retreat and 2 weeks and 3 and 6 months post retreat.","We work in partnership with sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse agencies in Los Angeles. Our programs our specifically designed to enhance and support existing programs and models; we do not duplicate existing services. Our Survivor Retreat Model is the first project of its kind that meets the parallel needs of survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse and the professionals who serve them. It offers a new and innovative approach to healing that is currently not available through traditional trauma response service providers. In surveying the field and in listening to the feedback from survivors themselves (Full Frame Initiative: How Do Survivors Define Success? 2014), we hear that traditional services such as emergency response, crisis counseling, support groups and case management, while necessary and critical, are not providing survivors with the level of long term relief from trauma that they are seeking. We also hear from crisis center advocates that the high demand for services and the ongoing reduction in resources leaves them depleted, with little to no time to step back and assess current programming and explore new opportunities for innovation. Our work through the Survivor Retreat Research Project seeks to improve the experience of domestic violence survivors and advocates by testing, evaluating and effectively implementing an innovative, survivor-centered approach to healing. The model incorporates survivor and advocate feedback and guidance at every level, from program design, implementation, participation, evaluation and dissemination. At the center of the model is the belief that every survivor holds the capacity to bring healing into their own lives. We believe this capacity expands when survivors are offered opportunities for healing that engage their body, mind and spirit. Set within the context of a healing community, this holistic model draws upon the individual's power to bring healing into their lives through their own assets and efforts and acknowledges the need for deepening connections to their informal support networks to provide continued support in their healing.","Our Los Angeles based program partners are Peace Over Violence, The Village Family Services, and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles. Crisis intervention staff from each agency received the Heal the Healers retreat in the first year of this research project and continue to receive ongoing support and leadership development on a monthly basis, offered by JHF’s clinical team. Program partners assist this project by referring survivors to attend the retreats offered by Joyful Heart Foundation.

 The demand for our signature Survivor Retreat Program has long exceeded its availability and reach. In response, we embarked on an ambitious three-year research project in partnership with Georgetown University to conduct retreats within a research model, evaluate their effectiveness, and create a replicable Retreat Model, which can be adopted by partner organizations and offered to survivors, professionals who serve them, and communities beyond our current capacity and scope. With the publication of the model as an evidenced-informed holistic intervention for survivors, agencies within the field will be able to solicit new funding opportunities and expand their offering of healing opportunities to survivors.
 In Year Three of this project, up to three additional retreats will be offered to control group survivors at the conclusion of data collection. Advocates from partner agencies (Peace Over Violence, The Village Family Services and the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles) will shadow JHF staff in these retreats as part of their implementation training. JHF will then conduct a needs assessment of these partner agencies to assess for ability to effectively implement the model. A plan for implementation of the model at these agencies will be developed by JHF, who will provide ongoing technical assistance and mentorship through the implementation period.
  
 Additionally, upon the completion of the research project, we will release a complete evaluation of the retreat development process, retreat experience, and post-retreat findings. We will create a dissemination strategy that balances free distribution with needs for training and fidelity to the model. We will publish our curriculum and support its effective dissemination. We will also empower program partners, key staff and researchers, to strategically share the research findings through conferences and written materials."

Jumpstart seeks to expand our program, particularly in South LA and East LA, to continue fostering intergenerational learning and improving the academic outcomes of low-income children.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,"Jumpstart provides high quality early education programming at almost fifty state preschools, Head Start providers, and child development centers throughout Los Angeles.",0CreatePlay0,"Somewhere among today’s preschoolers sit our future presidents, scientists, and entrepreneurs. Yet, by virtue of living in a low-income neighborhood, thousands of children in America are deprived of access to quality child care and early education programs, thus entering kindergarten already behind national benchmarks for early literacy and math. Research shows that these same children who start behind, stay behind—they are more likely to drop out of high school, be incarcerated for violent crime, and experience significantly lower earning potential upon entering the workforce. 
 
 Los Angeles is no exception to this trend. In a county where almost 20% of all families live in poverty, only 44% of children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District demonstrate grade-level reading and writing proficiency by the third grade. 
 
 By recruiting and training college students and older adults, called Corps members, to implement a research-based curriculum in preschool classrooms, Jumpstart works systemically and strategically to close the achievement gap *before* it begins. Our curriculum is uniquely designed to help children build the key language, literacy, and socio-emotional skills deemed by early education experts to be most vital for school readiness. Corps members deliver our high-quality program to the same small group of children twice weekly for an entire year, leveraging reduced adult-child ratios in Jumpstart classrooms to provide children with consistent, targeted individual instruction.
 
 Corps members receive 55+ hours of professional-grade training in early education best practices and methodology to support their implementation of Jumpstart’s outcomes-based program. They provide their partner preschool teachers with much needed resources and support over the course of the year, while simultaneously developing valuable workplace and leadership skills. The highly structured nature of the Jumpstart program instills in college Corps members the values of time management, teamwork, effective communication, and grit that are intrinsic both to success in their academic studies and to competitiveness in the job market. Our older adult Corps members experience significant health benefits, such as improved mobility and mental acuity. Informed by their experiences in the classroom, Jumpstart Corps members become early education advocates for life, and many seek out careers in education and human services related fields.","While in discussion with current and prospective partners, Jumpstart has learned a great deal about the growing need for quality early education programming in Los Angeles. However, capacity and funding limitations impact our ability to expand at a rate fast enough to fully meet demand. 
 
 Jumpstart is committed to intentional, strategic growth. We have identified South LA and East LA as communities of need, and will prioritize the expansion of those sites that directly serve these communities; specifically, our program at California State University Dominguez Hills and California State University Los Angeles. In the 2014-15 program year, both sites exceeded their goals for Corps member recruitment and children served. We are also deploying greater numbers of our older adult Corps members from our community site to classrooms in Compton and East LA, to reach additional children who may not be served by our regular college program.","Jumpstart’s “School Success Checklist”, a targeted adaptation of the High/Scope Perry Child Observation Record, evaluates children three times annually against fifteen key developmental metrics that research has indicated are vital to school readiness. This year, we commit to:
 
 - Serving 1,360 preschool children
 - 65% of children will make gains of 1+ developmental level(s)
 - Distribute over 3,000 books to families in communities where we serve
 
 In Pre-Service, Mid-Year, and Post-Service Surveys, Corps members report on academic, professional, and personal gains made through their experiences in the Jumpstart program. We commit to:
 
 - Recruiting and training 422 Corps members
 - 85% of Corps members will report Jumpstart improves their leadership and connection to their community
 - 85% of college Corps members will report Jumpstart helps them academically
 - 70% of older adult Corps members will report feeling ""somewhat satisfied"" to ""very satisfied"" with their health","While there are a multitude of organizations in Los Angeles addressing the challenges of the academic achievement gap, few to none provide direct, sustained support to our youngest learners—children ages three to five. For example, LA2050’s “Collaborating with the Crowd” publication indicated that only 8 submissions in the “Learn” category considered enrollment in early education programs as a metric to impact during last year’s challenge. The work being done to end educational inequity has predominantly targeted those children who have already entered the K-12 education system. Jumpstart is filling a growing need as the only supplemental early education program of its kind. Jumpstart’s work not only sets children on a path to overcome the achievement gap; we’re intervening early to ensure that the gap never forms in the first place. 
 
 Jumpstart Corps members, caring and well-trained adults with the tools and insights to make a measurable impact on preschool students, work with the same small group of three to four children for 8+ hours each week, for an entire year. Jumpstart leverages these small adult-child ratios to provide consistent, individualized instruction to preschool children, maximizing their academic outcomes. Corps members work closely and collaboratively with their partner children’s families and preschool staff to cultivate a culture of learning. 
 
 Jumpstart support college Corps members in pursuing careers in education and human services, and have recently begun piloting workforce development initiatives to support our alumni in moving into teacher prep programs. 
 
 Additionally, the older adults of our Los Angeles Community Corps serve several hundred children in the Los Angeles region not reached by our regular college program. These older adults often experience significant health benefits and reintegration into their communities by being a part of the program, due to their regular physical interaction with local children and families, as well as the additional resources provided by Jumpstart, such as case management and trainings in conflict resolution and healthy lifestyle changes. By pairing the two most vulnerable ends of the generational spectrum, we have seen the birth of a symbiotic relationship that encourages intergenerational learning in Los Angeles communities.","Jumpstart currently enjoys strong relationships with many of Los Angeles’ leading early education providers. We have a formal, written partnership with Los Angeles Unified School District to bring Jumpstart’s programs and services to early learning centers and preschools throughout the District. Jumpstart also works with the Los Angeles County Office of Education delegate agencies, one of the oldest and largest providers of Head Start in the country, among many other school districts and umbrella organizations that provide early education in low-income communities. 
 
 Jumpstart has identified South Los Angeles and East Los Angeles as two potential areas for program growth and expansion, and is fortunate to have the support of local partners such as Compton Unified School District; Proyecto Pastoral; and the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF). 
 
 Jumpstart Los Angeles currently has 7 college program sites and 1 community site for our older adult Corps members. Our college and university partners include the University of Southern California; University of California Los Angeles; Pitzer College; Pepperdine University; California State University Northridge; California State University Los Angeles; California State University Dominguez Hills.

 To take advantage of the opportunities before us and realize our strategic priorities, Jumpstart commits to deepening and expanding the knowledge and capacity of our staff, and ensuring that the children we serve and the Corps members we work with receive the best possible opportunities to learn and to lead. We seek to grow our program, particularly in the communities of South LA and East LA, where demand for our services is especially high. 
 
 Knowledge of Jumpstart’s operating model is made explicit to every program site. Each site uses the same tools to track key performance data and implements the same pre-designed curriculum, which standardizes the classroom instruction process into teachable routines while still leaving a degree of latitude for individual customization as needed by the site or the child. This standardization has been instrumental in enabling the replication of the Jumpstart program across the Los Angeles region. 
 
 Jumpstart operates on a licensee model, which leverages partner universities’ existing fixed-cost infrastructures and financial resources for more cost-effective scaling. Jumpstart plans to grow its program first at established university sites with a history of success, and then seek further opportunities to begin new sites after establishing a clear theory of change and confirmed support from key players at our partner universities, preschools, and school districts. 
 
 Meetings between Jumpstart’s program leadership, our partner preschools and partner universities, and prospective new partners occur on an on-going basis. The conditions for success and program goals for Jumpstart’s 2015-16 program year have already been determined. Thanks to the efforts of our site managers at California State University, Dominguez Hills; California State University, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles Community Corps, recruitment and training of Corps members have already begun, and Jumpstart is currently taking measurable steps toward program expansion in the South LA and East LA regions."

And, while employers are looking to fill a wide array of higher paying jobs that require only a H.S. diploma they are not finding workers who have the technical and job readiness skills required (2015, JPChase Morgan). 
 
 JVS WorksTM training programs help people who have a H.S. diploma and remain unemployed or under-employed get started on a career pathway that can lift them out of poverty today and beyond 2050. JVS WorksTM training programs prepare people for careers in the high growth industries of healthcare, finance and property management. Our training programs are provided at no cost to students, allowing them to start their career debt-free upon graduation. Each training program is developed in close partnership with top industry employers to ensure that our students are fully prepared with the knowledge needed to advance along a meaningful career pathway. JVS provides all classroom supplies, curricula, and fees for required certification or licensing for graduates.

The steady employment and income that our graduates enjoy provides them and their families with stability, economic self-sufficiency and independence. As our graduates are no longer dependent on public assistance, they are now contributing to the local economy in their communities.

Our strategy will be to partner with local human services providers who can assist with outreach and to conduct program orientation and enrollment sessions in these communities. 
 
 Another challenge we anticipate will in getting students to leave their community and travel to our training sites. Our strategy will be to provide students with transportation passes and a support needed to preemptively address any family crisis of childcare or other issues that may interfere with their ability to consistently attend classes. JVS will also seek to identify available free space in the targeted communities where we can conduct the training sessions, whenever possible.","JVSWorks will evaluate the effectiveness of our Outreach Campaign throughout the year by tracking the number of attendees at our program orientation sessions.

 • Employer engagement
 Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of JVS WorksTM programs is their high level of engagement with employers in our community. JVS frequently seeks feedback from our employer partners to ensure that our curriculum remains current at all times and relevant to the jobs they are seeking to fill. We host formal graduations for all of our JVS WorksTM programs that are immediately followed by a job fair at which recruiters from the employer partners interview every graduate. This greatly facilitates the numbers of our candidates who are hired, as well as the speed of the hiring process.
 • Supporting people facing barriers to employment
 JVS WorksTM programs specifically target the most economically- disadvantaged communities in greater Los Angeles in its recruitment efforts. Those served include single-parents, emancipated foster youth, veterans, people with disabilities, people for whom English is a second language, and many more. Further, the education requirement in each program is a high school diploma or GED, a relatively low hurdle compared with requirements for entry level jobs in other fields. 
 
 • Available at no cost to participants
 JVS is committed to raising the funds needed to provide these JVS WorksTM training programs at no cost to our participants, allowing them to start their career debt-free.
 
 • Technical skills AND “soft” skills

KCRW envisions a future as the premier multimedia forum for music, news, and culture. Building the KCRW Media Center is only the first step toward securing this future.
 
 Much in the same way that KCRW is a destination platform for artists and audiences, the KCRW Media Center will become a physical destination and a multipurpose venue. The 35,000-square-foot facility will provide three times its current studio and production space and boasts a 1,400-square-foot performance studio for established and emerging artists for decades to come. An audience viewing gallery will enable hundreds of people to experience intimate live in-studio sessions and performances each week, and we will broadcast these performances to millions of listeners and viewers worldwide. The building will be engineered to provide live broadcasts and public programming in shared SMC-KCRW spaces, including a 180-capacity auditorium and the 18,000-square-foot Wallis Annenberg Plaza Courtyard and Outdoor Stage. 
 
 The KCRW Media Center will be located on the campus of Santa Monica College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD). Conceived as a way to unite the College’s instructional facilities with its professional broadcasting partner, the CMaD campus will accommodate collaboration through shared spaces and public programming. The campus is located at the center of a transit corridor in Santa Monica’s Creative District near the LA Metro Expo Line stop at Bergamot Station and along expanded bus and bike routes. The campus design was even awarded the Urban Land Institute’s Los Angeles Real Creativity Award as an outstanding example of urban placemaking.
 
 The KCRW Media Center will be a Los Angeles landmark and a space to galvanize the public. Through programming on the radio, online and at hundreds of in-person events, KCRW will serve as the thought-leading community center of Los Angeles—a true “center” for this sprawling city often characterized as lacking just that. It will be a vibrant, publicly-accessible space for cultural discovery, civic discourse, and community building. With the ability to present live public programming in its own space, KCRW will deepen its relationship with members, engage new audiences, and stake its claim as the cultural epicenter for Los Angeles.","As with any large-scale construction project, the most challenging obstacle we face is deviation from the original estimated construction timeline for the KCRW Media Center. KCRW addresses such obstacles by working with our senior leadership, Santa Monica College (SMC) leadership, and the project management team (LPI, Inc. and C.W. Driver), to oversee the design and construction schedule and budget.","As a public media service, one of our most important duties is to evaluate the efficacy of our model, and structure our programs so they might become resources for a sustainable public media landscape. We measure success by tracking growth in listening loyalty and membership support among our audiences. We evaluate the impact of our programs through qualitative and quantitative metrics that examine listenership/viewership data, community feedback, participation via digital platforms, and attendance at live events. We measure our success in advancing access to arts and culture through feedback from the artists, storytellers, and public and private cultural institutions with whom we partner. We measure success in building and engaging communities through the attendance and feedback received at our original live event programming. These metrics inform KCRW’s leadership of the public response to our work and guide strategic decision making and investment in new opportunities.","KCRW is a flagship NPR station serving Southern California for over 30 years. There are five other public radio stations in Los Angeles. KPCC is operated by Minnesota-based American Public Media and provides news/talk programming as a service of Pasadena City College. KUSC is the University of Southern California’s classical music station and also operates two stations in San Francisco. KCSN is a modern rock music station out of California State University Northridge. KKJZ is licensed through California State University Long Beach and features Jazz and Blues music. KPFK is Pacifica Radio’s progressive local station featuring music, politics and public affairs programs. Of these, KPCC is the only other NPR affiliate. KPCC and KCRW complement one another yet provide a different value and service to the community and have about 30% audience crossover. Because of our unique format (a mix of music, news and cultural programming) KCRW reaches an educated, affluent and influential audience with the ability and inclination to impact change locally. Our audience is also significantly younger and demographically diverse than other public media outlets. KCRW also partners with music and cultural venues all over Los Angeles to promote emerging musicians through curated shows.
 
 As a free, public service media resource, we strive to be reflective of our communities and provide an accessible forum where the public can become better informed and engaged members of their community. KCRW serves the wider national network of public media stations as an essential source of trendsetting programming that reflects the spirit of Los Angeles and inspires audiences far beyond our city limits. KCRW programs reach millions more worldwide through syndication by Public Radio International, NPR, and 175 public media network affiliates (including stations in major US markets in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta). 
 
 Our listeners view and value KCRW as a local, mission-driven institution, and praise KCRW as a credible source for information and public discourse. Fernando J. Guerra, Director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, has said: “KCRW has sustained the civic dialogue in Los Angeles for the past 20 years. This dialogue leads to action and promotes justice. In a geographically large and diverse city, KCRW provides a ‘center’ where the challenges, solutions, and hope for the city can be discussed.","For this project, KCRW’s primary partner is Santa Monica College. The college secured capital funds to support construction and renovation of its Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus from Measure AA, approved in 2008 by Santa Monica-Malibu voters. From these funds, the college will allocate over $28 million to build the KCRW Media Center.
 
 KCRW is celebrated for its event programming. Whether broadcasting live from Park City as the official radio partner of the Sundance Film Festival, or our World Music Festival Series at the Hollywood Bowl, KCRW contributes to the vibrant cultural landscape by partnering with preeminent cultural institutions to offer over 100 live events each year, attended by 250,000 people throughout Southern California. 
 
 Currently, KCRW has no publicly accessible space to host the hundreds of events we organize each year. By this time next year, KCRW will have multiple dedicated, publicly accessible spaces to accommodate our passionate audience and host the diverse roster of events we already produce. Our new home will also give us the capacity and flexibility to explore new partnerships and event series that, up till now, we have been unable to produce.
 
 KCRW has a reputation as a thought leader, tastemaker, and digital pioneer—the first to partner with emerging platforms (such as iTunes and Spotify) to make its content available on whatever medium audiences seek. By adopting digital technologies KCRW has created a global footprint that includes millions of people worldwide from over 10,000 cities and 183 countries. 
 
 An LA2050 grant award would go directly to KCRW to support public programming in the KCRW Media Center.","The total project budget for KCRW’s Capital Campaign is $48 million. To date, we’ve secured over $41 million of our goal from the College, our Board of Directors, and a growing group of major supporters. We have over 85% of the total project budget committed. KCRW will continue to solicit major gifts from over 200 foundation and individual donor prospects (identified as part of a 2013 wealth screening of our donor database). We will also solicit gifts from our more than 50,000 members through on-air pledge drive for the Campaign in December 2015.
 
 KCRW is a public radio station supported by two organizations—the KCRW Foundation and Santa Monica College. The College holds the FCC broadcast license on behalf of the station and from its beginnings, KCRW has operated as a department of the College and is acknowledged as “a community service of Santa Monica College.” The KCRW Foundation is the primary operating organization of KCRW. Financial and strategic oversight of the KCRW Foundation is provided by the Foundation Board of Directors, two of whom are ex-officio members from the College. All revenues (except a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, received by the College) go directly to the KCRW Foundation and nearly all of KCRW's expenses, including 90% of all salaries, are paid by the Foundation. 
 
 Santa Monica College secured capital funds to support construction and renovation of its Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus from Measure AA, approved in 2008 by Santa Monica-Malibu voters. From these funds, the college will allocate over $28 million to build the KCRW Media Center and KCRW Foundation will provide $10 million to support the design, equipment and furnishing costs for the building. KCRW will not be required to pay rent to the College for use of the KCRW Media Center. This is in keeping with our current arrangement with the College, whereby we do not pay rent to the College for our current office space. We do anticipate increases in programming expenses in the first few years of our operation from the KCRW Media Center, as we plan to (1) produce more original news, music, and cultural programming with expanded production space, and (2) produce more live programming and public events from our new headquarters to celebrate our inaugural year in the new facility. For this reason, our Campaign budget includes $10 million to support new programming and technology.","The total project budget for KCRW’s Capital Campaign is $48 million.

From these funds, the college will allocate over $28 million to build the KCRW Media Center and KCRW Foundation will provide $10 million to support capital expenses, including the design, equipment and furnishing costs for the building. To fully realize the potential of our new facility, KCRW has committed to raising $10 million to invest in new programs and explore new technologies that best serve our audience—on air, online and in person. All of the $100,000 provided by an LA2050 grant award would support these public programming expenses.","At the time of submission of this proposal, KCRW has secured 85% of the funding required to successfully meet the campaign objectives. Construction of the KCRW Media Center will take place in one single phase with the expansion and site improvements underway at the College’s Center for Media and Design (CMaD) campus, located at 1660 Stewart Street in Santa Monica, CA. The California Division of the State Architect (DSA) permits were approved on June 26, 2013. Project contractors C.W. Driver began work on the site on October 1, 2013. A public groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2014 and buildout of the KCRW Media Center is scheduled to be complete by August 2016. Installation, training and commissioning of broadcast systems and equipment will take place over a three-month period, estimated to begin in August 2016. KCRW will move into the building in December 2016. 
 
 The impact of the KCRW Media Center will be fully realized when KCRW has the resources and stability to create new platforms that allow us to arrive at the future one step ahead of our passionate audience with the kind of quality programming that defines KCRW. The $10 million raised through our Programming and Technology Fund will provide KCRW with the resources to: (1) Produce more live event programming to build community, (2) Develop new shows and multimedia content to educate and enlighten listeners, and (3) Create new technologies and platforms to extend our service and engage new audiences. 
 
 By this time next year KCRW will move to its new 35,000-square-foot multipurpose headquarters and redefine its role in the lives of people who call Los Angeles 'home'. KCRW will expand its program offerings, enhance its journalistic coverage, and provide greater access for its legion of devoted audiences from all around the world by working toward the following measurable objectives:
 
 - The state-of-the-art KCRW Media Center opens in December 2016 
 - New programming—on-air, online and in-person—is phased in beginning in 2014
 - Connect to new audiences so that by 2017
 - Weekly listeners increase to 625,000 (baseline: 533,000)
 - Web traffic increases to 688,000 unique monthly visitors (baseline: 510,000) 
 - Cumulative mobile app downloads increase to 600,000 (baseline: 450,000) 
 - Social media audience increases to 2.5 million (baseline: 1.5 million)
 - Event audience increases to 268,000 (baseline: 212,970)
 - Internship opportunities increase to 50 (baseline: 25)"
5102160,Kensington Presents: Free outdoor arts programming for all ages with California State Parks,2015104,,,"In close partnership with the California State Parks Department, we’ll continue the evolution of Kensington Presents from our front porch in Angeleno Heights, to a yearlong series at the Viaduct. Throughout the year, we’ll transform the Viaduct, a magical urban park, into a thriving community arts space celebrating local artists, engaging local businesses, and inviting Angelenos of all ages to enjoy eclectic programs in a safe, clean, fun park setting in the heart of the city.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Downtown LA/Chinatown,ALL,"“Arts and cultural programming is a new, but vital, venture for California’s urban State Parks. A creative partnership with Kensington allows State Parks to experiment in this area, outside of our realm of expertise, and offer cultural programming that is engaging, inclusive, culturally relevant, and reflective of the city’s history.” –Stephanie Campbell, Acting Superintendent, California State Parks
 
 A Neighborhood Project: Kensington Presents is a community-driven, donation-based series of arts programming that started on a front porch in the historic neighborhood of Angeleno Heights. We had 24 different acts take the stage in the first two years alone, including musicians from the LA Philharmonic, opera singers, local bluegrass and gospel bands, harpists, Chinese fiddlers, and mariachi. 
 
 From the Porch to the Park: We've been lucky to connect with The California State Parks to expand our programming to The Viaduct, a hidden gem of a public park in Downtown LA. We’ve already activated it twice, once for a screening of the Passion of Joan of Arc with a live score by a string quartet and chamber choir, and once for a bluegrass and gospel concert and BBQ. Both shows were at capacity with 300+ attendees. 
 
 A Full Year of Programs: We're asking for your vote to get us in the running for LA2050 so that we can grow our partnership with the California State Parks in 2016 and provide an eclectic and inviting yearlong series of free arts programming to the community.
 
 Educational Outreach: In an effort to engage more communities, families and especially kids across the city, we’ll hold four seasonal workshops, either at a local school or on-site at the Viaduct. We’ll also feature one or more youth groups as opening acts at our events, reaching out to school-based jazz, rock, classical, hip-hop or marching bands.
 
 A Great Place to Play: We would use these funds to extend across the year and across genres, to pay the performers and a lean team of producers, and to make sure that our events remain free to the public. We think of our events less as traditional events and more as immersive experiences, each one a jewel box of local treasures: food vendors, artisans and other small business and arts orgs. We’ll maintain the sense of fun that’s defined our Kensington series for the last two years and bring that spirit of play to a larger community, at larger scale, and draw many families and friends to attend a State Park for the very first time.","Getting people to put down their phones, turn off the TV, and come engage with their communities around artistic programming in public space is not always easy. Especially when you have a family, it can be an expensive hassle to have these sorts of experiences. By creating interesting, eclectic, engaging programming, we have found people willing to make the effort to attend, and feel rewarded for it. We hear constantly how enlivening they are for people, we often hear “this is what I love about LA.” If we were to have the LA2050 grant, we would be able to market the events to a wider, more diverse audience, and provide more dedicated programming and services for families attending the events.","- Number of total attendees at Kensington Presents events at California State Parks locations

 While all three of these institutions are well known and important to the arts and wider communities in LA, Kensington Presents is different in its diversity of programming, deliberate scale and State Parks setting. 
 
 In some ways, Kensington combines some of the strengths of these three organizations, maintaining the intimate, community feel of Sofar Sounds, even at a scale closer to KCRW’s events and with a truly eclectic slate of programming loosely similar to Redcat – though our programs are less experimental, FREE, and far more accessible to all.","Presenting Partner:

The play parks would be designed for children that are baby, infant, and toddler ages and would provide a safe, indoor environment as a relief from outdoor factors (weather, transients, etc). Portable play equipment and mats would provide appropriate levels of play for smaller children to express themselves and play physically while protecting them from their surroundings and allowing for easy clean-up.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Poinsettia Recreation Center,ALL,"I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical motor skills, both individually and with each other. Many outdoor playgrounds aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing their children are in a good environment. The equipment will be similar to an indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging. The equipment can be portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as not to interfere with current programming. KIPP's will be offered at numerous City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities. Participation for the children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as many children in the community as possible. This type of programming will offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between parents/caretakers. It will also create a connection between parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing participation in other park programs in the future. By developing the relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its residents and better serve the public.","I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's approval process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well as, any approval needed to host such program at the desired parks. The City has policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times. If the funds are ""donated"" into the City's general account, then I will have to patiently work through the purchasing process. If the funds can be awarded and the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and quicker to obtain the items needed. I will take the initiative to propose KIPP to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed. I will also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper usage of the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a variety of activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of KIPP (classes, workshops, games, etc).","I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a need for this type of programming. After selecting the parks and implementing the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who frequent the park. I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers. I'll see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see at the KIPP. I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are dealt with in a timely manner. I'll also see how participation varies when the program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.","Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity. However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA. What's unique about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of program within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on a more widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other businesses. I am currently a Facility Director employed with the City of Los Angeles who recently had a baby, so I have both the connection within the City, as well as, a direct need and interest in such program on a personal level...which will keep me engaged in this endeavor.","I am currently involved with the Playa Vista Moms Group (PVMG) in which I am co-chair of events. This group provides resources and connections to moms living in Playa Vista. I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking purposes. Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid in the production and promotion of the KIPP. I'm also a member of Alpha Phi Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to assist with the research and production of the KIPP. I anticipate that both PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project and Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. I anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).","I think this project will cost the full $100,000. This amount will include the planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project. It will also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can before it can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the program.","The estimated budget for this project is as follows: 
 
 $2000 = Playa Vista Moms Group
 $2000 = Women In Leisure Services
 $3000 = Alpha Phi Fraternity
 $43,000 = Staff Fees
 $40,000 = Equipment Fees
 $10,000 = Miscellaneous Fees (research, potential partners, cleaning fees, permit fees, unforeseen costs)","I plan to review all forms of evaluation and personally involve my friends, family and myself with the project. In working with the City of LA's Department of Recreation and Parks I hope to gain their support and implement the project at as many parks as possible. By adopting my idea, the City of LA can then budget for this program in the future. Kids Indoor Play Parks will fill the void left by the City of LA when they had to terminate their licensed preschool programs. Additionally, KIPP will fulfill the need for programming for babies, infants, and toddlers that the City of LA does not currently provide."

County is vast, with many diverse communities within its borders, including our country’s largest population of foster children. Once removed from their parents’ homes, many live with non-family members or in group homes; and they relocate and change schools more than six times. This transiency makes it difficult to learn vital life skills, garner work experience or make a plan for the future. They are isolated, and as they age out, this persists and sets them up for a life of instability. 
 
 In 2013, the Alliance for Children’s Rights and Children’s Law Center sought an engaging way to meaningfully educate and empower every transition-age youth, ages 16-24, or “TAY” in L.A. County. Together they created the Know Before You Go campaign (B4UGO), which features multimodal platforms to help TAY and organization’s serving them in the areas of work, school, life, health, money and more. This campaign was created for foster youth, informed by foster youth. That novel concept alone connects TAY, gives them a voice and a lifeline accessible in print or from their phone or computer. 
 
 Connection hallmarks of Know Before You Go platforms: (1) Print Toolkit: Foster youth are provided a packet of resources at court by their attorney building a connection with one of their key advocates; (2) B4UGO app: GPS-based mapping and notifications connect TAY with food banks, housing, clinics and more across L.A. County. LA2050 can make a 2.0 version of the app possible with filtered content, zip code searching and account login (based on TAY focus groups); (3) Knowb4ugo.org: The first website created for foster youth in L.A. County is a clearinghouse of information that is necessary to achieve success in life, school and work. LA2050 will connect more TAY to this new resource while increasing features. Soft launch in October 2015; (4) YouTube Channel: This first-of-its-kind web series is a talk show-style hip and entertaining series of videos starring foster youth talking about things like how to get a job, roommates, social media and more. There is nothing like it and it will give TAY a YouTube community, build connections with each other, and a new forum for conversation. The first season is in production and LA2050 can make season two a reality. See attached pilot video. (5) @knowb4ugola: A new Twitter account to bolster all communications for the campaign connecting more TAY to the tools on a platform they use daily.","This campaign has 15,000 distributed print packets and 3,300 app users. Thousands more TAY, plus those who care for them, have yet to tap into all the new platforms. Making these tools available to connect TAY with the community is possible, using two key strategies to overcome the challenge of awareness and to increase our user base:
 1. The Alliance, widely known as an excellent collaborator, will work in partnership with other youth service organizations, through whose networks we will expand Know Before You Go’s reach.
 2. This grant will allow us to partner with a communications firm to create a multi-pronged promotion strategy.","To evaluate the success of expanding Know Before You Go Campaign, we will track these measures:
 # hardcopies distributed
 # app downloads
 # hits on knowb4ugo.org
 # YouTube views, subscribers, shares, comments
 # Twitter followers @knowb4ugola or prevalence of the use of #knowb4ugo
 
 We will compare the popularity of the different platforms, and we will request monthly feedback from the Young Leaders group that is part of a local collective impact project, the Opportunity Youth Collaborative, to test the usefulness and validity of content and delivery. This information will inform further development of the campaign.","No other organizations similar to the Alliance, such as Public Counsel, United Friends, iFoster, etc,. have a comprehensive project such as Know Before You Go, but they value it and are taking advantage of it for the TAY they serve. Through Know Before You Go and the Alliance NextStep Program’s participation in the L.A. Opportunity Youth Collaborative, which has 50 partners who are working together to break down siloes that keep resources for TAY separate, this campaign will succeed in helping TAY reconnect with the community.
 
 There are similar veined initiatives in terms of leveraging video and online learning, but nothing is as multi-faceted or comprehensive as Know Before You Go, and nothing else targets foster youth in L.A. County to help them reconnect. There is no other YouTube channel for foster youth, by foster youth. There is no other app built specifically for foster youth. 
 
 The Storyboard Project has a YouTube channel that shares testimonial-style videos of youth sharing their stories, but it is not framed around the skills and information youth need to succeed in the world. Unlike Know Before You Go, it is not tied to a website with comprehensive information or to an app.
 
 Think of Us is a national organization that is developing an online platform to support foster youth, but it is not targeted at TAY in Los Angeles, and is also just getting off the ground.","Plans for the next year include collaboration with the Department of Children and Family Services, L.A County Probation, iFoster, 211, and Children’s Law Center to evolve the B4UGO smartphone app into a county-wide collaboration. These partners see that Know Before You Go is becoming the “go-to” resource for foster youth in L.A. County. Their partnership will create a richer pool of resources for TAY and will ensure consistency of messaging across these key organizations, greater distribution support, and the opportunity to add different interactivity to the app. These partners will receive no direct funding from this grant but do access all of the platforms for their clients and will help to expand content by contributing information about their programs.
 
 ManifestWorks, an entertainment industry job preparation program, is the production partner on the YouTube web series and will receive $30,000 to complete season two. ManifestWorks will receive $15,000 for its work, while also using foster youth and formerly incarcerated young adults to create the videos as part of their workforce training program. Endertech, a web and app designer, will receive $50,000 for completely redeveloping the smartphone app and continue designing the website. A communications consultant, yet to be identified, will receive $7,500 for creating and implementing a marketing plan. 
 
 Dozens of foster youth focus groups guided development of this project and continue to influence content, design and special feature decisions for all platforms. Some of the youth will be compensated for participating in the development of season two of the YouTube Channel series.","The entire project will occur during a period of approximately nine months and will cost $179,582. 
 The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation already committed $30,000 to the KB4UGO Campaign. The remaining $49,582 not covered by these two grants will be covered through fund raising efforts, which include grant applications, fund raising events, and gifts and donations. 
 
 The LA2050 Grant Challenge funding will take us a long way toward accomplishing the goal of reconnecting foster youth with our community, helping them not only to access resources, but also to regain that feeling of belonging they lost when they had to leave their birth homes.","Personnel expenses for four staff:

County, providing pertinent information to transition age youth (TAY). The toolkit has been instrumental in training hundreds of providers on resources available to TAY, and while it has been a change agent, it is expensive to print and not easily updated. The new knowb4ugo.org website replaces the print toolkit while adding value beyond the toolkit’s capability. For instance, a webpage on job readiness can link directly to an upcoming job recruitment event. Using the app and Twitter page in conjunction with the webpage ensures maximized reach and alerts users to new information instantly. Our goal is to eliminate hearing “I wish someone would have told me” by creating an effective, available, and appealing way of instantly sharing information and resources with this previously disconnected population of L.A. County.
 
 In the child welfare community, the KB4UGO toolkit and app are seen as the “go to” resource for TAY by TAY, social workers, attorneys, foster parents, and organizations. Created and designed with youth in mind, TAY participated in development. This sets the campaign apart and positioned it to become a national model. Organizations in other states, and even in other countries, have asked to leverage the campaign’s concepts, especially the B4UGO app. YouTube, Twitter, the app, and the website are all adaptable media that can evolve, grow, deepen and be useful for TAY everywhere, who are transient and can be difficult to reach. This campaign allows us to reach them where they are, respond to their needs, and speak to them in their own language.

5102189,L.A. Flag Redesign,2015124,,,"Los Angeles is a great city, and every great city deserves a great flag. Our current flag is neither good nor effective and, consequently, has all but faded into obscurity; people don’t know it, and because they don’t know it, they don’t fly it. A well-designed flag, however, will serve as an emblem of unity and pride; it will bring together millions of otherwise disconnected Angelenos by restoring a sense of civic pride and strengthening LA’s ‘brand’ identity throughout the world at large.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0CreatePlay0,"Los Angeles is currently undergoing an incredible transformation: Development is booming, neighborhoods are thriving, and the very heart of our city is growing and adapting to meet the needs of an ever-changing 21st century. We are in the midst of a stunning revival and, as such, are the frontrunner to host the Olympic games in 2024. We are on the cusp of something big and all eyes are upon us. 
 
 Yet many people – residents and outsiders alike – still consider us to be a fragmented, disconnected city with no heart. But while Los Angeles may not have one central destination, there are scores of individual neighborhoods and enclaves teeming with art, culture, history, and beauty, from Sylmar to San Pedro, Ventura Blvd. to Venice Beach. These urban gems might be separated by miles of broken road and crowded freeways, but they are all part of what makes Los Angeles a complex, unique, and truly unparalleled city. 
 
 Our goal, then, is to connect these individual, segregated pockets with a powerful, unifying flag – a simple and distinct emblem that bonds the east siders and the west siders, the rich and the poor, the old and the young; a symbol that belongs to every Angeleno, regardless of neighborhood, race, background, or socio-economic status.
 
 A new flag – one that we can all rally behind – will serve as a symbol for all of Los Angeles, promoting and representing the city itself, while uniting millions of Angelenos around the world. As we continue to lead the way through the 21st century, a new flag will help show the world that, despite our expansiveness and our often-frustrating idiosyncrasies, we are not a disjointed suburban metropolis, but rather an awesome, nuanced, and self-respecting city.
 
 We are focused on connecting Angelenos, raising awareness, and gathering broad support to convince city officials to approve our proposal. Once the initiative is passed, we plan to launch a citywide design competition in search of a new flag – a contest that will undoubtedly connect Angelenos, not only with each other, but with the city as a whole, investing them in the future of Los Angeles by empowering them to participate in the rebranding of their city.","Our greatest challenge will be convincing city leaders to make the change. Government officials are often resistant to change; they are busy people with a catalogue of extremely important issues (e.g. homelessness; joblessness; education) constantly vying for their attention. In the face of such important issues, this initiative might be seen as trivial, or frivolous. Our strategy is to obtain popular support at the grass roots level in order to convince decision makers that a well-designed flag will give LA a banner under which to rally in order to face those ‘more important’ issues. Popular support brings about change; we intend to maximize the power of the people.
 
 We also intend to focus on the future. Lots of resources are being poured into unifying and beautifying LA (e.g. the restoration of DTLA; the revival of the LA River; the Olympic bid). We will make clear that the best way to march towards this bright future is to do so as a single unified city, under a great new banner.","We can simply and easily track our progress and support through the metrics built into our website and our community Facebook page. We will be able to further evaluate our progress based on support we garner through change.org. 
 
 Our mission is to constantly engage the public, gaining support and attempting to connect with everyone everywhere. Therefore, the effectiveness of this project will be evaluated partially by our ability to target as many neighborhoods, communities, organizations, festivals, etc. as possible. The wider the broadcast, the stronger the message. 
 
 The overall success of this project hinges solely on getting the initiative passed – until that happens we can’t officially call for design submissions or adopt a new flag. Therefore, we will constantly be evaluating our work in regards to how many people we’ve reached. Our work will not be done until the city approves our proposal and every single Angeleno is united under a great new flag.","No, there are no other organizations doing similar work. 
 
 While New Zealand and Fiji are in the midst of redesigning their country flags, and other American cities, such as Milwaukee and San Francisco, are currently campaigning to redesign their city flags, no other organization in Los Angeles is championing this cause. 
 
 The truth is, the vast majority of Angelenos don’t know what the LA flag looks like – in fact, most don’t even realize that we have a city flag. But whether they realize it or not, people care about flags. Flags are important and people get passionate about them, for better or worse, as evident by the recent controversy with the confederate flag, or the boom of U.S. flag sales after 9/11, or even the unification Chicagoans feel over their ubiquitous city flag. 
 
 Our approach will be unique in that we intend to raise overall awareness about design and how effective it can be when incorporated properly into the framework of our city. Laying this foundation will enabling Angelenos to think about the future of LA as a more connected, well-designed, and cutting-edge city of tomorrow.",There are currently no other partners involved in this project.,"Right now, the project is budgeted at $100,000 based on the amount of this grant, and the majority of this money is earmarked for advertising with the sole purpose of raising awareness, gathering popular support and convincing city leaders to approve our proposal.","$18,000 will be used to produce a stunning campaign video that will serves as a pillar of our campaign – a powerful call-to-action, designed to educate, galvanize, and inspire. $40,000 will be spent on advertising via local radio (e.g. KCRW) and print publications (e.g. LA Weekly, Los Angeles Magazine, LA Times). It will also cover the cost of grassroots advertising (e.g. renting booths at CicLAvia and other local festivals; engaging artists, designers, and students throughout every district; attending conferences such as Future of Cities). $42,000 will be dedicated to boosting social media awareness through platforms such as Facebook and in-app advertising. This aspect of the campaign will focus on obtaining citywide support to pass our initiative. It will also serve to connect and engaging as many Angelenos as possible via social media, while educating them on the importance of city flags and the benefits of a new, well-designed Los Angeles flag.","The first step will be to produce the campaign video and advertising materials.
 
 Then, we will review all upcoming events and advertising opportunities in Los Angeles throughout the next 6 to 8 months and budget for those.
 
 The rest of the funds will be allocated on a month-to-month basis based on the conversion rates we get through the various advertising outlets. We’ll start small in advertising pockets, and determine which markets and platforms are most successful and scale our budget accordingly. 
 
 Should the city accept our proposal before our entire budget is spent, the remainder of the funds will go towards increasing enthusiasm and support for the new, redesigned LA flag!"
5102165,L.A. Works: Volunteers for a Greater LA,2016120,,,"Connect to your community through volunteer service with L.A. Works! We are striving to transform Los Angeles by creating a culture of volunteerism that will encourage Angelenos to connect with other volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and the issues they are most passionate about impacting. By growing our Managed Project programming, we will make volunteering even more accessible by having opportunities led by trained L.A. Works volunteers in every neighborhood of Greater Los Angeles.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"Los Angeles ranks an appalling 45th out of 51 major cities in the U.S. for volunteerism. According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) research, long commuting times and high poverty rates, as is the case in Los Angeles, can adversely affect volunteering rates. 
 
 By utilizing L.A. Works existing managed project model that mitigates the challenges of long commute times to make it easy to volunteer, and expanding our volunteer leadership programming and curriculum, L.A. Works strives to shift the culture of civic engagement in Los Angeles. 
 
 At the heart of our organization are our volunteer leaders who manage opportunities each month at our nonprofit partners’ sites – so anyone can make a difference in L.A., regardless of skill-set, interest, age or schedule. Opportunities include conserving natural environments, serving meals to the homeless, offering companionship to seniors, leading athletic sessions with special-needs youth, and reading to children (to name just a few!). Neither the nonprofit partners nor the volunteers are charged to participate. 
 
 For nonprofits, this connection provides a critical resource to stretch their budgets, share important information about their missions, and tap volunteers’ unique skill-sets that might not be available or affordable within their staff base.
 
 We hope to expand and deepen these connections by building out the managed program model. L.A. Works’ goal is to move our city up in the national rankings by blanketing LA County with quality volunteer opportunities that are happening every day of the week, at a variety of times of the day. Our vision is to make these opportunities so accessible that people won’t even need to leave their neighborhood to engage in meaningful volunteer work. 
 
 L.A. Works Managed Projects are often the “starter project” for people to connect with community service. By not requiring a long-term commitment, the Managed Projects allow volunteers to test out a variety of opportunities until they find the one that best fits their interests. Often, from there, individuals will make a longer-term, deeper connection to the nonprofit organization where they’ve served.
 
 The expansion of Managed Projects will contribute to the ongoing effort to improving Los Angeles. With the help of this award, we hope that in the near future, LA will be thought of as a model for service as much as we are known for entertainment, sports, and our weather.","Although L.A. Works is confident that the Managed Projects model is effective, the success of its expansion will be based on significantly increasing the number of nonprofit partner sites. Additionally, we will still need to overcome the same barriers that come with efforts to mobilize people in LA; namely commute times. 
 
 To overcome these obstacles, we will need to be strategic with our recruitment efforts to ensure that the Project Leaders and volunteers being recruited are matched with issues and nonprofits within their geographic comfort zone. And we will target specific groups and spaces where we know we can find dedicated and passionate changemakers to help us expand our program and to grow with us. By targeting these existing partnerships by region, we know we’ll find the volunteers we need to stick with us through the early stages of expansion.","L.A. Works will evaluate the success of the program through the lens of four important constituents: general volunteers, volunteer leaders, nonprofits, and the clients the nonprofit serves. For the volunteers, volunteer leaders, and nonprofits, L.A. Works will conduct post-project surveys (through a link in the follow-up email to participants) to collect the relevant data in order to track and measure our success in achieving the following desired outcomes. We will ask that the nonprofits provide us with quantitative data on the impact the volunteers have had on their mission and clients served. 
 
 Additionally, L.A. Works' Director of Programs will conduct qualitative and quantitative baseline, formative and summative research using online questionnaires and one-on-one interviews where necessary throughout the grant cycle.","L.A. Works is a proud affiliate of HandsOn, a national network of volunteer centers. HandsOn affiliates in California include HandsOn Bay Area and One OC. Although our programs vary, all of us seek to bring people together to strengthen communities through meaningful volunteer action. 
 
 What makes our organization’s approach unique is our heightened expertise in volunteerism. L.A. Works was established in 1991, in the same timeframe that the national HandsOn Network was formed. Our programs have had over two decades to develop, and our Managed Projects program is one of our most solid programs. Its key characteristics include the sustainability of the program model and the impact that the program has in the wide range of issue areas that it serves. By training volunteers to become project leaders, we are giving volunteers the skills to manage their own groups of volunteers. Once they are fully trained, these projects require little oversight from L.A. Works staff. In addition to the training they receive, project leaders and general volunteers are all passionate individuals who care deeply about making a lasting change in the community.
 
 Our approach is also unique because it puts the changemaking in the hands of the community. Although we provide the training, it’s our community members who bring their unique skills and experiences to the role of Project Leader. It’s people from the community that make Managed Projects the success that it is because they have first hand experience of what the issues are and the best idea of what solutions will work. L.A. Works may be connecting volunteers to the project and volunteers to each other, but it truly is the volunteers who turn the projects into meaningful experiences.","It order to make the volunteer projects most accessible, L.A. Works hopes to be able to grow our Managed Projects such that we are partnering with at least 150 different nonprofit agencies across Greater LA. Each of these organizations will then have at least a monthly (typically bi-monthly) project with approximately 20 volunteers spending approximately 3 hours at the nonprofit site. If we are to use the Independent Sector value of volunteer time in California at $26/hr, this would average to leveraging the grant funds to provide nonprofits in LA with at least $234,000 of volunteer resources each month.
 
 In addition, to raise the profile of volunteerism in LA, L.A. Works will utilize a portion of funds from this grant to commission the production of white papers that detail the extent of volunteerism in LA, its contribution to the local economy, and the level of nontraditional volunteering that is taking place.","Although this program is something that L.A. Works currently runs, we are at capacity with our existing staff size and roles. To jumpstart this program and significantly increase the number of nonprofit and volunteer leaders involved, we would use the full $100,000 grant; the funds would be used to hire a new staff member to focus on the program’s expansion as well as to conduct research to raise the profile of service in LA. Once the program is expanded, our existing Director of Programs would be able to maintain the relationships with the volunteers and nonprofit organizations moving forward.","Project Coordinator salary and benefits: $65,000
 Research and white paper distribution: $12,500
 Overhead: $10,000
 Project supplies: $5,000
 Marketing materials: $5,000
 Volunteer recognition: $2,500","Although L.A. Works mobilizes more than 35,000 volunteers in service each year, we only have a full-time staff of nine. We are able to do so much as a grassroots organization thanks to the dedication and generosity of our volunteer leaders. We have more than 90 trained volunteer leaders at our nonprofit partner sites and each quarter we have between 15-20 skilled volunteers assisting with various aspects of our organizational infrastructure – from social media to community connections. 
 
 The Managed Project program is designed to scale. We have a trained volunteer leader who is assisting with the training of additional leaders and are currently recruiting to identify a volunteer to assist with recruiting additional volunteer leaders from within our own cadre of volunteer participants. Once the volunteer leader is in place and trained on our volunteer database system, there is minimal management time needed to oversee this program on a daily basis."

 ➢ Sell Fine Art and Support a Fine art exhibition
 ➢ Employ Fine artists
 ➢ Art installations
 ➢ Engage Artists to produce for Craft Booths
 ➢ Employ Food Booths and Food Trucks
 ➢ Employ Artists for installations
 ➢ Employ Performance artists
 ➢ Employ Multi-Cultural music stage
 ➢ Employ Experimental music stage
 ➢ Employ DJs music/dance stage (Night)
 
 This event would be supported by the artists representing hundreds of cultures within LA. The event will be a success for all of our communities. An environment where artists and their friends and neighbors congregate to see the art of fellow Angelenos is a great way to learn about and celebrate the different cultures of Los Angeles. Artists often represent the vanguard of a community's curiosity and inclusion and tolerance. A painting, a sculpture, an installation, a song, a play, a dance, are seen by fellow artists as expressions from a fellow traveller. 
 
 
 As a mega-city, a world class city, an international media center, a gateway city, Los Angeles is in a unique position to demonstrate new and innovative approaches for cultivating connectivity in a world with more diaspora, more urbanization, more fragmentation and more clustering . Cultivating city-wide communication and learning by and about artists and their creations, artists from LA's various communities should help to make Angelenos more curious, interested, and knowledgeable about the cultures in the City of Angels, ultimately more tolerant of their neighbors and work colleagues.
 
 Interaction in a forum like LA ART FEST would foster understanding of the ""other"" in a creative and positive, family-friendly forum.
 
 Reasons art projects benefit the larger community:
 
 • Artists create economies that benefit the smaller community and often times the larger community. 
 • Cultural diversity rubs off on each other. Supporting cultural diversity offers better understanding of our fellow man. 
 
 • Education: As community members become exposed to information about, various cultural efforts, the more they want. Education/information is always good. 
 
 • Cooperation: Cultural efforts help bring people together to accomplish great things for the community.","Logistics will be the most difficult aspect of the LAAF. Logistical challenges below:

 Attendance - Attendance will be measured by counting the number of attendees. The diversity of attendees will be measured by analyzing surnames in a database format. 
 
 Quality of presentations - Successful presentations will be measured by the number of presentations, the diversity of presentations, and the artistic merit of the presentations. A catalog of presentations will be produced for review by event producers and Los Angeles cultural affairs administrators.
 
 Successful administration of the event will be measured by evaluating conformance with the budget, permit compliance and management of vendors and implementation of sculpture installations.

Each year, we reach 20,000 students through a college and career convention, over 150 free financial aid completion workshops, and a scholarship reception, empowering them to apply to college and seek financial aid. This year, we hope to increase aid students secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"LA Cash for College was developed in response to a Tomas Rivera Policy Institute study which found that while the majority of Latino parents wanted their children to pursue college, their knowledge about how to get into and pay for college was objectively low. The study made clear recommendations to help address these knowledge deficits, including better informing parents about the process of accessing college, launching a long-term public services announcement campaign in English/Spanish to improve parent's college knowledge, and increasing the scope, frequency, and visibility of college events such as college nights, open houses, and campus visits.
 
 Since 2001, LA Cash for College has been building a college-going culture in L.A. using a three-pronged approach of 1) informing students and families about college preparation and financing their education, 2) assisting them in applying for aid, and 3) rewarding positive behaviors like applying for aid. Each step of the way, students and their parents are encouraged to pursue their college aspirations.
 
 Inform: Beginning the campaign each year, the annual College and Career Convention is designed to help participants understand the accessibility of college, features expert-led presentations on college life and academic preparation, interactive career demonstrations, information sessions about scholarships and other financial aid, as well as an Exhibition Hall of local, state and national college and university admissions recruiters.
 
 Assist: Then, in partnership with the California Student Aid Commission, LA Cash for College hosts over 150 free annual workshops that assist students and families complete their financial aid applications from January 1st to March 2nd. Workshops are conducted with a wide network of community partners and trained volunteers from colleges, universities and businesses to provide one-on-one assistance to help students complete the FAFSA, the California Dream Act application, Pell and Cal grants. Eligible students qualify for up to $18,000 and free financial aid they never have to pay back.
 
 Reward: Finally, there is a scholarship reception in May, which features prominent guest speakers and local elected officials, to award a limited number of $1,000 incentive scholarships to participating students from the Convention or a Workshop.
 
 The campaign has assisted nearly 240,000 students prepare for college, apply for financial aid and secure $3.3 million in scholarships.","Starting with the 2017-2018 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, students will be able to apply beginning October 1 instead of January 1. In addition, the FAFSA form will allow applicants to automatically import their income tax data from two years prior. Although both policy changes will make it easier for low-income students to access college financial aid, LA Cash for College will have to restructure its programming timeline.
 
 Based on the new timeline, LA Cash for College would continue to host the Convention in October, but would begin giving the financial aid completion workshops in October instead of January. The workshops would go from a 2-month period to a 5-month period, extending staff time and program resources dedicated to coordinating them.
 
 Another challenge is adapting to the modes of communication used by students to consume information. Last year, CSAC launched a smart phone app offering financial aide resources that we would like to build on.","LA Cash for College evaluates both the Convention and the Financial Aid Completion Workshops each year in order to maintain the quality programming that has made us the region's largest college and financial aid information program. Students who attend the Convention fill out a form with demographic and economic data in order to enter a lottery for a $1,000 scholarship. This information tells us who we are serving. In addition, we send attendees an electronic survey asking them for feedback on the convention.
 
 Students who participate in the Financial Aid Completion Workshops must complete an Exit Survey, which is sent to the CSAC to be eligible for the $1,000 scholarship lottery. The surveys inform our program on the quality of the workshops and areas of the workshops that can be improved. The survey also allows students to request follow-up help if they were unable to complete either their FAFSA or California Dream Act application at the workshop.","In 2011, a student aid policy analysis by Mark Kantrowitz found that of the students that didn't fill out a FAFSA, 60.7% thought they were ineligible, 22.9% had no information on how to apply, and 18.9% thought it was too much work to apply.
 
 LA Cash for College's approach is unique because it provides resources and builds capacity locally, greatly enhancing other organizations' capacity to inform and assist Los Angeles students, exponentially increasing the amount of students who are impacted by the LA Cash for College program.
 
 In addition to reaching more students through LA Cash for College's extensive network of partners, the program incentivizes student participation by offering students an opportunity to win a $1,000 for attending the Convention or completing a FAFSA application at a free Financial Aid Completion Workshop.","UNITE-LA believes collaboration is at the heart of its work. In particular, the LA Cash for College campaign could not accomplish its wide outreach without the supports from partners. Over 150 community partners help make LA Cash for College a reality through opening up their space, volunteering time and hosting workshops. As part of the $!00,000 grant, UNITE-LA would set aside $10,000 towards 20 buses that community partners could utilize for participation in the College and Career Convention. In addition, $10,000 would be set aside for $1,000 incentive scholarships that will support youth from 10 community partner organizations. A total of 30 community partners will receive some supports through this grant averaging in value of $750 to pay for costs associated with transportation, financial aid informational resources, and materials for the Convention and Workshops.","LA Cash for College's budget is $350,000 and includes program salaries as well as program expenses, such as: the Convention, student transportation, stipends for workshop sites to help offset some costs, and scholarships. LA Cash for College receives some funding from the California Student Aid Commission, the City of Los Angeles, and private funders, such as the Kresge Foundation.

With the new website, the program is developing better ways of reaching students, including: blogs from staff members and experts about college access issues, an integrated social media strategy, text messaging to students, and intentional emailing.
 
 In addition to the website, the LA Cash for College team plans to develop the California Student Aid Commission's smart phone app by linking to the LA Cash for College Campaign. Understanding the ways in which students consume information today, the app will attract more students, give us the ability to measure which resources are most useful to them, and guide our future information and assistance strategies.

Many outdoor playgrounds aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing their children are in a good environment. The equipment will be similar to an indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging. The equipment can be portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as not to interfere with current programming. KIPP's will be offered at numerous City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities. Participation for the children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as many children in the community as possible. This type of programming will offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between parents/caretakers. It will also create a connection between parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing participation in other park programs in the future. By developing the relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its residents and better serve the public.","I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's approval process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well as, any approval needed to host such program at the desired parks. The City has policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times. If the funds are ""donated"" into the City's general account, then I will have to patiently work through the purchasing process. If the funds can be awarded and the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and quicker to obtain the items needed. I will take the initiative to propose KIPP to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed. I will also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper usage of the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a variety of activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of KIPP (classes, workshops, games, etc).","I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a need for this type of programming. After selecting the parks and implementing the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who frequent the park. I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers. I'll see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see at the KIPP. I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are dealt with in a timely manner. I'll also see how participation varies when the program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.","Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity. However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA. What's unique about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of program within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on a more widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other businesses.

This group provides resources and connections to moms living in Playa Vista. I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking purposes. Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid in the production and promotion of the KIPP. I'm also a member of Alpha Phi Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to assist with the research and production of the KIPP. I anticipate that both PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project and Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. I anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).","I think this project will cost the full $100,000. This amount will include the planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project. It will also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can before it can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the program.","The estimated budget for this project is as follows:

5102138,LA League of Imagination,2015089,,,"We will launch 20 Imagination Chapters throughout Los Angeles to form the ""LA League of Imagination."" Imagination Chapters are pop-up learning spaces that teach 21st century skills to children through Creative Play. They can launch anywhere, with anyone, and require few resources to ignite child imagination.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"We imagine a world where creativity and entrepreneurship are core social values nurtured in schools, homes and communities everywhere, where all children are taught to be creative thinkers and doers, and encouraged to make their very best ideas happen.
 
 In 2012, the short film ‘Caine’s Arcade’ charmed the world with its message of creativity, handwork, perseverance and community. Called a “great American story” by the Christian Science Monitor, the film sparked a global movement and launched the Imagination Foundation, a nonprofit organization to foster creativity and entrepreneurship in children. Our hallmark event is the Global Cardboard Challenge, which has already impacted nearly 350,000 children from 70 countries. This event is a month long campagin to celebrate child creativity and the simple things adults can do to foster it. See www.cardboardchallenge.com.
 
 Following from the inspiration of ""Caine’s Arcade"" and the success of the Global Cardboard Challenge, in 2014 we launched the Imagination Chapters program worldwide. Imagination Chapters are community-organized learning spaces that foster creativity and other 21st century skills through Creative Play. Chapters are volunteer-led and can start anywhere, including schools, homes, libraries and community spaces. Our educational model at the heart of the Chapters program recently won a global challenge sponsored by LEGO and Ashoka to “re-imagine learning.” What began as a 30-site pilot program in 2014 is now growing to serve new Chapters around the world, including 20 in Los Angeles to form the ""LA League of Imagination.""
 
 Imagination Chapters are popup learning spaces for Creative Play. They are community-organized and volunteer-led. They are designed to launch in a variety of locations, and can accommodate whatever resources are available (especially and including recyclables). Many Chapters launch in classrooms and operate as part of the regular school day. Others launch in homes, libraries, and community centers, and alongside of after school programs or other nonprofits. Professional educators and also other adults — from all walks of life — can start and lead an Imagination Chapter. The focal point of a Chapter is a Creative Play session. Creative Play is a process whereby children build whatever they can imagine using available tools and resources, and then share their creations in person and online. Sessions can be simple or complex depending on participant age and materials.","Our biggest challenge is adult perception, that fostering child creativity is a difficult, time-consuming task, requiring training and resources, and best suited to educators. But in truth, sometimes the best thing that an adult can do is simply give some room and get out of the way, a bit, of child imagination.
 
 Another challenge is to proliferate Chapter growth within school environments, where though Chapters have potential to impact high numbers of children and transform school culture, they confront barriers like rigid structures and high-stakes testing.
 
 We overcome both challenges the same way, by making the Chapters model a lean and simple program. It requires few resources, training or infrastructure, in part because Creative Play (at the heart of the Chapter model) taps into a child's natural creative talents.","Through Creative Play, children grow in ""creative self-efficacy,"" which is comprised of numerous next generation skills, especially creativity and innovation, as well as social-emotional skills like collaboration, resilience and empathy. Children also learn skills that represent fundamental STEM literacy and engineering-thinking. Measurement is assessed using various surveys, and a randomized sample of child portfolios (through Consensual Assessment Technique). We will also compile data on child development from short monthly survey’s administered to Chapter Leaders.
 
 We will examine academic performance data (such as attendance and discipline data) to explore and demonstrate impact on traditional school-related outcomes. Surveys to examine parent/care-giver observations will be administered twice per year to document the transfer of key skills to home environments.","Programs that are similar to Imagination Chapters are maker spaces, creativity labs, DIY clubs and other organizations that encourage children to play with materials and build the things they imagine. Imagination Chapters are distinguished from these programs primarily because of their ""low floor"" and ""high ceiling.""
 
 This means that Chapters can engage children of all ages using very simple and familiar materials (such as cardboard and recyclables), but through Creative Play and with the introduction of new tools, Chapters can easily and quickly escalate to more advanced skills and content. Escalation works for many reasons, including the “just build it” mentality which is fundamental to the Chapter ethos, encouraging a fun and fearless approach to building whatever a child can dream up. 
 
 The “low floor” of a Chapter is important because it avoids the cost-prohibitions of similar programs (Chapters don't require expensive equipment). It also engages children who are historically underrepresented in these sorts of programs (girls, for example). By tapping into the natural creative talents that all children possess, and beginning with materials and topics that are of interest to kids, Chapters can introduce children to increasingly advanced experiences over time.
 
 Another important distinguishing factor of Imagination Chapters is the large and sociable network of Chapter Leaders. The ""LA League"" of Chapters will participate in a global network of Chapter Leaders from around the world (places like Bosnia, Pakistan, China and S. Africa). Chapter Leaders will share experiences and knowledge together, as well as reach out for help. This high degree of global connectivity rapidly accelerates learning for Chapter Leaders, and provides children a worldwide venue to share their experiences as well.","Collaborators on this project include the YMCA of Greater Los Angeles, LA Conservation Corps, LAUSD, Santa Monica School District, select charter schools and public libraries. Approximately $1,000 per each Chapter site would be allocated for the purpose of tools and materials for children to use during Chapter meetings. With a total of 20 anticipated Chapters, that amount is $20,000.","This project will cost $150,923.

In large part, the sustainability of the program is due to the simplicity of its implementation; it trains leaders from all walks of life, and it can be implemented within formal and informal educational environments and with basic materials, therefore avoiding cost challenges of similar programs, like maker spaces, or other STEM/engineering programs.
 
 In addition to its simple implementation, the Chapters program is scalable and sustainable for two other reasons: 1) massive economies of scale and, 2) a strong network of engaged Chapter Leaders. Regarding economies of scale, because much of Chapter Leader training and support is conducted virtually in group formats, relative costs of management decrease with program growth. And regarding the network of Chapter Leaders, because they are part of such a strong and highly social international cohort, much of the support leaders receive is provided in peer-to-peer contexts, which is less costly to manage than direct trainings.
 
 The LA League of Imagination will be a highly visible entity, both locally and worldwide. Its activities will be well publicized, which will in turn create new interest and continued growth beyond the LA2050 grant."

5102214,La Paletera de los Angeles - Fruit Bars Cold Drinks Healthy Delicious Snacks.,2016150,,,La Paletera is up scaling the current “paleta” vendor model by selling healthy frozen fruit bars produced with sustainable business practices. The fruit bars and other healthy snacks will be sold from a colorfully designed solar powered cart. The frozen ice pop stick will be etched with environmental friendly messages in various languages. The objective of La Paletera is to become a micro-enterprise venture that will create sustainable jobs to the entry level workforce for women.,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"MDLT is poised to launch La Paletera de Los Angeles in the summer of 2016, a social micro-enterprise spinning off the rich food diversity found all over neighborhoods in Los Angeles. La Paletera aims to reclaim a Mexican tradition of healthy and nutritious food offerings in the form of frozen fruit bars and natural fruit flavored waters. The model provides a creative entrepreneurial platform for women to develop healthy “paleta” and “aguas frescas” recipes by drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los Angeles. The idea is to encourage women to innovate by intersecting the traditional with the new and create recipes that contain high nutritional values that pack a solid dose of vitamins and minerals in one serving.
 
 Due to the high level of obesity in children in the Los Angeles County (23%) the Angelinos are becoming more focused on healthy living and lifestyles. La Paletera reflects a delicious healthy snack in an affordable alternative. La Paletera is a clear example that healthy and delicious can be available at a reasonable price. 
 
 We are not try to become the next designer but to take back our culture and the traditional way that paletas used to be made. This means no short-cuts using food coloring, sugar and artificial flavors. Only the freshest fruits, vegetables and water.","We have known since the beginning that vending is not allowed in many places and our plan is to work in those jurisdictions where cart vending is legal. We have developed contacts and relationships with numerous jurisdictions including the City of Culver City and California State Parks where we have the opportunity to become a vendor. Both venues will be considered for our launch.
 Another major challenge is the safety and security for the “paleteras”. During our field research, the current “paleta” vendors shared frightening incidents of being “shaken down” by gang members or other intimidating people for their daily earnings. Currently this is a cash business and the money is readily available since many vendors just put the cash in their pockets.
 We will be installing a secured mechanism where cash will be deposited within the cart and plan to use devices such as the square to have the ability to take credit cards. Safety policies and procedures will be of the Paletera training.","MDLT will utilize qualitative and quantitative measures to evaluate La Paletera enterprise and the effectiveness of the small business Paletera as it develops in time. Data will be used to duplicate La Paletera business as the project grows. Daily sales by Paleteras will be documented and tracked. Feedback will be solicited via social media and on the spot conversation of buyer preferences and requests. Feedback will also be solicited from Paleteras regarding public comments, and impressions.
 Paleteras will serve as positive role model for their families and neighboring friends and serve as links to anyone who is interested in learning about starting a small enterprise. This information will be tracked through pre and post surveys and assessments. 
 
 An important measure of success will be how this learning experience encourages paleteras to engage with other people in the community, their fellow paleteras, and other businesses within the community.","At the time, there is no healthy option as street vendors. La Paletera is comprised of a recruitment and training program; upgraded bicycle propelled vending carts (“Paleta-Mobiles”) with support equipment and transportation vehicles; a frozen goods making facility to supply La Paletera vendors; and micro-lending opportunities for low-income participants. We define success as the emergence of “Paleta-Mobiles” with vendors offering high quality fruit bars, refreshments, and other healthy offerings at beach boardwalks, selected regional parks in the region and other appropriate outdoor entertainment spaces. The vending carts and products are intended to be presented for their value in promoting healthy food choices, with environmentally responsible food handling and packaging practices. Environmental tips will be etched on the Popsicle sticks and anti-litter messaging will be included in the environmental-friendly packaging.
 
 The vision behind La Paletera fuses major demographic, economic, environmental, and health trends in a manner that reaches beyond the elite appeal of the healthy foods movement. This vision further reinforces community needs and values at all economic levels and ethnic groups through its product selection, ecological ethics and new product mobility.
 Mujeres de La Tierra is a Los Angeles based non-profit environmental organization that has positioned itself as a catalyst in new approaches addressing quality of life beginning with women and their families.
 
 Our field work over the years has clearly indicated that we cannot separate the conversation of healing “La Madre Tierra” with the economic realities of everyday survival they both go hand-in hand.","We have learned that our work is enhanced and strengthened when we engage and involve other non-profits, community organizations, neighborhood groups, community stakeholders and leaders. This effort will be no different. We have been planning La Paletera for over 2 years and have worked and will continue to partner with:

5102314,LA Pop Up Parks,2015209,,,We built the first park in 30 days with less than $20K and a lot of volunteer help. We propose to re-create this project in 5-7 unused or open city owned spaces all over LA. We have lessons learned in place from the first successful pop up park and partners ready to support the creation of several more right away. We can take dead space in LA and bring it back to life to help people create stronger communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,We can build these parks anywhere there is unused or open lots in the city or county,Play,"Our parks are free to use by anyone. Paid for by grants, sponsors and partners and built in 30-45 days on a lot that is totally unused or unwanted. In our park in Venice, there are places to work on your own or in teams. Many young parents come by with small children so they can be engaged in their community without sacrificing parental quality time. Events can book out the space for non-commercial purposes and local organizations use the space for community meetings and gatherings (both civil and religious). We are unbranded, totally inclusive and literally a gift to the local community. We also build a robust website, provide free wifi, set up a staffing and oversight plan and even bring in local food and drink vendors so that park guests have a chance to get something light to eat or drink.","We've identified hundreds of open lots across LA, we need the city to allow us to transform these lots and financial partners to underwrite the costs. We also need slight zoning changes on some of the land but that is also avoidable through selective consideration of potential lots. Otherwise, no barriers exist and we already built this in Venice so a proof of concept exists and I encourage all judges to visit the Venice Pop up Park to be convinced of our effectiveness at making neighborhoods better.","We evaluate our work based on three things. 1) can we get people to use the park once it's built 2) can we attract the right kinds of events that will be productive and respectful of neighbors 3) Can we gain overwhelming acceptance and support from the immediately surrounding community prior to construction so we can build a park that fits what the surrounding community needs. In Venice it was quite place to work, create, sit down (there are no places to sit on AK Blvd) and bring family and friends without a more raucous element in proximity. In other communities the requests may differ.","Yes. Pop up parks are not new. They are done by community organizations and brands all the time. However, we can't find any organizations doing them in LA right now. We did this because we could and we needed to for our community. We are applying for this grant because others have begged us to do this again and again and we think the cost metrics finally support that goal.",The 100K grant will be used to set up a program to build 5-7 pop up parks all over LA. We build these parks well enough so that can be permanent but we call them pop up parks because sometimes the land chosen may have another purpose in the next few years and then we can literally pick up the park and bring it to a new location where it can do good. The whole process we create was such that almost everything is re-used. For each project we will recruit a design firm that reflects the local community and is able to pull the best ideas out of the local residents. The City and County of LA will have to partner with us as well since they most likely own the land we will build on. For the Venice Park we found private property to do this on so we didn't have to deal with government red tape on the pilot program.,"We built the first park for $20K. We would like to build 5-7 more. The grant funds will compliment a fundraising effort to ask local businesses to chip in for the extra cost, which is minimal and actually totally avoidable if that effort is successful. We didn't need grant funds to build the first. We raised money from 4 local businesses but that was quite difficult and having a block grant like this means we can actually move forward and guarantee at least 5 parks without additional funding.","These metrics are for one park: We feel if we build 5 at once we can get a significant discount and many items for free or donated (such as wifi)
 
 $5K Design and Construction Oversight (licensed contractor reduced fee for 2 months)
 $11K Materials (wood, AstroTurf, paint, sandpaper, hardware, tools)
 $500 Website
 $2K Opening Event
 $1K City and County fees for permitting
 $1K Free wifi and power for 1 year",With more parks we can make deals with telco's to provide free wifi. TWC passpoint seems like the most likely since they are city wide already and can just provide us log in access to the network. we have relationships with Lowes and Home Depot and with higher volume of park they are interested in donating materials. The only thing that slows our scaling down would be the interest in local/city/county government in allowing citizens to use their own resources to beautify and enhance their neighborhoods. We also would have to work very hard to recruit and hold onto human capital in the form of coordination and construction volunteers.
5102275,LA Riverworks: A Vision to Engage LA Communities in River Revitalization,2015186,,partner: 237105149,"Plans to revitalize the LA River promise to deliver over 18,000 jobs, billions in private development, and tremendous environmental benefits. But a fundamental question remains: who will access these benefits?
 
 LA Riverworks wants to engage local residents to help existing neighborhoods thrive alongside a revitalized LA River.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Northeast LA,0Create0Live,"In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city, connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health and economic opportunities that the River promises.
 
 By engaging low-income residents, families, and entrepreneurs in existing River-adjacent communities to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that support local needs as well as regional goals, SEACA and Public Counsel will ensure that the communities that live along the River today can continue to thrive alongside a revitalized River in 2050. 
 
 Specifically, our project will help make LA the best place to connect by:
 
 • Engaging a broad range of stakeholders—such as local residents, youth, seniors, and small business owners in multiple languages—around LA River revitalization proposals;
 • Connecting local government policies to the needs and priorities of River-adjacent communities;
 • Promoting transparency and meaningful community engagement in public planning and investment decisions;
 • Linking local residents and other stakeholders to the political process;
 • Connecting with a network of housing and economic development experts to evaluate and cultivate strategies to address the needs of local neighborhoods;
 • Leveraging the River restoration and related developments to expand access to opportunity for local residents and other stakeholders;
 • Promoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and
 • Addressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of residents and small businesses.
 
 A barricaded concrete River bisecting underserved neighborhoods has been an unfortunate image of disconnect and spatial inequity in the geography of our city. With this unprecedented investment, all that can change. But connection is key. Connecting local residents to opportunities starts with a connection to each other and to the investment process.","Key decisions about the LA River are being made now. Federal funding may be allocated as early as next year; the city is considering the creation of a new financing district; the state recently announced a $25 million contribution to purchase a large undeveloped parcel; and Frank Gehry is now involved in a proposal to supplement existing revitalization plans. If communities don’t get engaged now, they likely will lose the opportunity to have input in the process. With our proven engagement strategies and understanding of land use and equitable development policies, we are confident that we can overcome this challenge.
 
 Local investments are complex and involve many public sector decision makers. We may encounter jurisdictional overlap, as a number of agencies—local, state, and federal—have varying degrees of oversight and interest in the LA River. Our existing relationships with officials and our capacity for complex legal analysis will help us navigate these considerations.","Outreach logs and sign-in sheets will track attendance and outreach to community members. We will also engage in an evaluation process with community members utilizing self-reported data collected at key intervals. This process will include individual surveys, group evaluations, and tracking progress towards meeting campaign goals.
 
  Outcomes will include:
 • 150-300 residents, small business owners, and other stakeholders engaged
 • 20-30 youth trained in advocacy and civic engagement
 • Development of education and social media tools highlighting various issues related to the LA River restoration 
 • Development of a community-informed policy platform 
 • Community members will report greater knowledge of LA River investment strategies and impacts
 • Community members will report greater knowledge of tools to advocate for policies that support accountable River investment
 • Residents will report greater connection to others across various River-adjacent communities","While many public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders from different sectors have shared their input related to the LA River plans, few have engaged with or focused on the needs of existing River-adjacent communities. Lower-income residents of River-adjacent communities especially have struggled to actively impact the planning process due to a lack of capacity and expertise. 
 
 SEACA has over a decade of experience engaging low-income youth in Chinatown, Solano Canyon, and Lincoln Heights around issues of economic justice, and we have begun expanding our work to include residents from Atwater Village and Elysian Valley. Public Counsel has longstanding and widely respected legal and policy expertise in issues of community development, land use, and urban planning. 
 
 Together, we have the ability to meaningfully engage local residents on issues of equitable development across multiple languages and at a level that no other organization engaged in LA River work has been able to do.","SEACA and Public Counsel have agreed to collaborate on this project and have worked together to connect and mobilize diverse communities and create a more sustainable LA for the last five years. Through our partnership, communities have been able to come together to identify solutions to key needs such as jobs and affordable housing. SEACA trains hundreds of youth to become leaders in their communities in order to educate and mobilize seniors, working adults, and youth in five different languages. SEACA’s members include individuals residing in several River-adjacent neighborhoods. Public Counsel provides the land use expertise needed to turn community priorities and goals into policy proposals that can be eventually adopted into law. 
 
 In 2013, SEACA and Public Counsel successfully worked together to engage residents and develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown Los Angeles. The campaign empowered and educated youth leaders to advocate for more affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our joint efforts in mobilizing the community and providing policy and legal support, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The LA Times twice called the plan “A Model for LA,” and it garnered the support of environmentalists, for-profit developers, labor unions, affordable housing advocates, transportation experts, AND the local community. 
 
 If awarded an LA2050 grant, each partner will receive $50,000. In addition, Public Counsel regularly works with other legal and policy experts, and we expect to engage these partners as our platform is developed.","We estimate that total cost of the project will be $114,464, including $52,250 in expenses from SEACA and $62,214 in expenses from Public Counsel. Costs exceeding $100,000 will be covered by general operating expenses or additional grant funding raised for the project.","SEACA will allocate funding as follows:

Unless local residents are equipped with the tools to shape investments and large scale development projects, resulting benefits and opportunities may not reach current residents. 
 
 We are proposing to engage residents, city officials, and other stakeholders in LA River communities to ensure that the return on our investment is shared by the low-income residents and families that called this area home long before it caught the eye of politicians and real estate developers. Through community engagement, legal research, and advocacy, we aim to maximize the positive impacts of a revitalized River, such as local job opportunities, affordable housing and expanded park space. And we aim to minimize negative impacts like the involuntary displacement of local residents and community-serving small businesses. 
 
 Specifically, we will achieve the following:
 
 1. Conduct a community assessment. 
 SEACA and Public Counsel will analyze data and speak with local community members, community-based organizations, and economic development experts/researchers to gain a deeper understanding of River-adjacent communities, map community assets, and assess the risk of gentrification and displacement.
 
 2. Launch a community-informed policy and organizing strategy.
 We will use information gleaned from the community assessment to develop policy and organizing strategies that address LA River-area residents’ needs and priorities. We will collaborate with stakeholder groups to educate and mobilize residents on the River investment and its impacts on the community through the development of education workshops, infographics, a comic book, and multi-media tools. In partnership with residents and other stakeholders, we will identify and develop legal and policy tools to help ensure the River build out is transparent and benefits ALL Angelenos, including local communities. We will then work with city officials to include these policies in River investment plans.
 
 3. Monitor development to ensure community priorities are implemented. 
 Many residents aren't aware of the magnitude of the potential investment or the potential opportunity the River brings if the investment is shaped with local communities in mind. As River development begins, we will monitor activities and share information with residents to help develop tools for meaningfully shaping River community benefits."
5102144,LA Veterans in Need: IAVA’s Rapid Response Referral Program,2015093,,,"This grant will support IAVA’s Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP), providing LA’s more than 320,000 veterans and their families with support as they transition to civilian life—which can be challenging in LA, where homelessness and unemployment rates among veterans are higher than average and where it can take over a year for a VA claim to be processed. IAVA will hold numerous community outreach activities to provide vets with access to RRRP and its holistic, integrated partner services.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0Create0Live,"Post-9/11 veterans living in LA face daunting challenges during their transition to civilian life. Many struggle to find employment, reintegrate into their community, or navigate complex bureaucracies to obtain health care. A $100,000 grant through this program will enable IAVA to meet these challenges by expanding the work of RRRP in the greater LA area. Our Veteran Transition Managers (VTMs), who have master’s degrees in social work, will help connect veterans to needed resources in Los Angeles. Our VTMs will increase VA healthcare utilization by educating clients on the services of the West LA. VA and advocating for them to get appointments, and will do the same with other vet-specific and community-based resources in greater LA, including housing and mental health resources. We will build and demonstrate resiliency through our community building work in California, creating social engagement events for veterans.
 
 Through this program, IAVA will ensure that veterans in LA receive the services they need to enable them to become productive members of their communities. The specific outcomes that will be realized during the grant period are:
 
 • RRRP will serve at least 180 veterans and veteran family members from the Greater Los Angeles area. This would represent a 20 percent increase in the number of individuals served over the past year, indicating that RRRP is gaining traction and deepening its impact in southern California.
 • RRRP will provide these clients with at least 400 referrals to critical resources and support systems—addressing a variety of needs such as mental health care, financial and legal assistance, and help with finding civilian jobs.
 • Trained RRRP Ambassadors (veteran members of IAVA) will conduct 25 or more peer-to-peer outreach activities at LA colleges and universities, service partner locations, and community events to encourage veterans to access RRRP and its many benefits.
 • IAVA will host one convening of veterans’ service providers in southern California, in order to broaden the network of providers to which RRRP refers clients, and also to foster increased cooperation among nonprofits, government agencies, and other key stakeholders for the veterans community. Our ultimate goal is to strengthen the safety net for veterans throughout Greater L.A.
 • IAVA will develop formal relationships with at least six providers in Greater L.A.","A primary barrier for this program is limited staff to promote the above services. To address this challenge, IAVA has introduced a new program through which our most dedicated members serve as “RRRP Ambassadors”. These Ambassadors—mostly veterans, but also some family members and civilians—volunteer to promote RRRP in their local communities on a regular basis. They receive a one-day training that focuses on outreach and mobilization practices, best practices in community mapping, RRRP’s service model, and techniques for engaging veterans on a peer-to-peer level. Thus far, IAVA has more than ten active Ambassadors in the LA area, and we are currently working to schedule additional training sessions for additional interested volunteers. Harnessing energy from other potential stakeholders, such as the bureaucratic VA system (e.g., the troubled VA West LA Medical Center), is a potential challenge, but we plan to use our VTMs and Ambassadors to work with these partners.","IAVA monitors each client’s case through Salesforce, the database that confidentially tracks our interactions with veterans and core program outcomes. Salesforce enables IAVA to process real-time information on: the number of RRRP clients served; the number and type of referrals provided to clients; the number of benefits confirmed as received; and the length of time it takes to resolve each client’s case.
 
 IAVA also receives direct feedback from RRRP clients. Once their cases have closed, clients complete surveys in which they report their level of satisfaction with their case managers and whether RRRP helped reduce their stress levels. RRRP clients consistently rate the level of service they receive from RRRP VTMs highly. Written feedback further illuminates clients’ experiences with RRRP. “Thank you,” one wrote recently. “You may have just saved my life man.” This is just one example of the warm words of appreciation that RRRP clients have shared.","The need for a program like RRRP is great, and other notable organizations—such as The Soldiers Project, 211, the Battle Buddy Bridge Program and the United Way—are responding to it. To date, however, none are simultaneously providing holistic and ongoing professional support, facilitating seamless access to quality resources, connecting veterans and family members to an expansive peer community, and amplifying impact through data collection and dissemination. Additionally, while this project is focused on veterans in the greater L.A. area, IAVA works nationwide, enabling us to provide continuous care to a potentially transient population.
 
 Specific examples of what sets RRRP apart include:
 
 • RRRP offers more than a hotline: Veteran Transition Managers look at clients’ needs holistically and provide ongoing support for as long as it takes. All VTM’s are masters-level social workers, whose education and experience has focused on veterans. Many are veterans or veteran family members.
 • Each RRRP client has a dedicated point of contact to manage resource navigation, while also having access to IAVA’s expansive peer community. This broad support is more versatile and readily available than would be possible for any single peer counselor.
 • RRRP connects veterans with a range of resources—from local services to national programs, both governmental and nongovernmental. We listen to clients about what works and what doesn’t, and we make referrals only to best-in-class resources.
 • RRRP has a low barrier to entry, helping people with all discharge statuses and income levels, as well as family members. No one has to come to an office. Help is just a phone call or email away.
 • RRRP brings to bear IAVA’s national brand and a decade of media savvy. Thanks in part to our regular media presence our brand is both recognized and trusted; this is critical for a program that requires veterans to proactively ask for help.
 • Because RRRP does not provide direct services, it does not compete with providers. We do possess the tools, digital capabilities, and reach to facilitate connections among providers and more seamlessly shepherd clients through the maze.
 • RRRP tracks program data in real-time, including the number and location of clients served, number and type of referrals and benefits received, average case times, and more. We survey clients about their experience with RRRP and every referral received. This data helps refine program and outreach strategies.","Strong relationships with service providers and a solid understanding of their programs enable VTMs to make better quality referrals and to serve as stronger advocates on clients’ behalf when needed. These providers are also the best sources of referrals to RRRP—a client is more likely to contact RRRP at the recommendation of another service provider that he or she trusts. Top partners in the Greater L.A. area include PATH (People Assisting the Homeless), Volunteers of America, the Soldiers Project, Inner City Law, and Valiant VA Claims Services in Orange County. 
 
 Thanks to a grant from a private foundation, IAVA is currently piloting a program in LA through which we provide small ($2,000 to $3,000) sub-grants to a select number of referral partners. We anticipate completing an evaluation of this pilot program by June 2016, with plans to expand the program if it proves successful. We have therefore included $5,000 in the budget for this grant for sub-grants.
 
 To advance referral relationships, IAVA is making a concerted effort to develop formal memoranda of understanding with service providers in Greater Los Angeles. IAVA recently hosted a convening in Orange County for representatives from 17 best-in-class service providers from across the employment, education, housing, and mental health sectors. These will be excellent referral partners for RRRP; we plan to host a similar event in southern California in the coming year.","As detailed below, the one year budget for this program is $343,980. IAVA receives support for this program from a number of foundations, including the Resnick Foundation, Phil and Monica Rosenthal Foundation, Annenberg Foundation and the May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust. In addition, RRRP’s national activities (including those in California) are funded by the Educational Foundation of America, The van Ameringen Foundation, and Harley-Davidson Foundation. IAVA is committed to sustaining and expanding RRRP, and our development team is working tirelessly alongside senior leadership to diversify and expand revenue sources for the program in LA and on a national basis.","Personnel:

 Launched in 2014, with only in-kind support from our various partners, the Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program brought forth and celebrated the top teen poets in Los Angeles, and provided various platforms for their voice and leadership. Program materials were promoted across the LA Unified School District, and students were encouraged to submit five poems and a CV. These materials were created to not only identify the best poets and writers, but also young leaders. A group of esteemed judges, including CA Poet Laureate, and numerous other writers from across Los Angeles, selected 12 finalists, as well as the first ever LA Youth Poet Laureate. Along with receiving a proclamation from the City of Los Angeles at a live poetry event held at the Downtown Public Library (where all the finalists performed), the winner received a book deal from Penmanship Books. 
 This year we hope to expand the program by offering curricula resources that promote the values of our program through poetry. To this end your support will help us expand the program and work of the Youth Poet Ambassasdors to:
 
 § Hold (4) Town Hall Meetings during the year, open to the public, that engage issues of voter participation, job opportunities, and college access.
 § Engage Ambassadors for (4-6) voter drives during the year, and 4 additional volunteer engagements.
 § Plan and produce (4) Word/Works trips where young writers access professional spaces where writers are valued, like PR/marketing firms, recording studios, and city government.
 § Provide free creative writing workshops and curricula that promotes civic engagement, youth leadership and voter participation.
 § Create a series of [4] events leading up to the final event where the LA Youth Poet Laureate will be chosen and a Proclamation issued.
 § Create a public library tour for the youth poets involved.
 In summary, this program aims to expand the role of poetry for young people to include writing that inspires a sense of civic and community participation, as well as speak to the issues that affect them most.","With some of the lowest voter rates in the country, we anticipate that it will take time to shift the culture around voting. 
 
 The multi-faceted ways that we will address these issues, with young poets driving the conversation, adds an immediacy and relevance that is not founded in the voter/volunteerism framework.
 
 This program in NYC was responsible, in 5 years, for helping to raise the voting rate for young people by 18%.","Because this program is based in presenting/producing events and Town Halls aimed at shifting the culture, as well as Word/Works trips, workshops and college access activities - we evaluate our work by not only reaching our benchmarks, but also by serving as many youth as possible with these opportunities.
 
 Also, as we shift the culture and bring attention to these issues, we are allowed great access to spaces of power and governance. Evaluating our success enlists a multi-faceted approach to document all of this work.","Because this work centers the creative voices of our youth around real and tangible issues, there are not many competitive organizations doing this work. We have aligned ourselves with all of the literary arts orgs across LA County in order to identify top writers, as well as share these opportunities to as many students as possible.","We have a number of literary arts organizations that will be enlisted in this work as we receive support, that include Beyond Baroque, Say Word, Write Girl, and Get Lit. These organizations all have thriving youth communities and also are key partners as we choose the Youth Poet Ambassadors and LA Youth Poet Laureate. Each organization will receive up to $10,000 for their participation and partnership.","This project will cost approx. $120,000.

5102174,LA’s Promise Technology Academy,2015112,,,Our organization seeks to establish a LA’s Promise Technology Academy at each of our school sites and expose 90 students from low-income backgrounds to STEM-related activities and careers.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Create,"For more than a decade, the United States has trailed the international community in Math, Reading, and Science, producing a growing surplus of workers with limited skills and further hampering our nation’s ability to compete on a global stage. According to the National Math + Science Initiative more than 46.8 million new jobs will be created by 2018, of which one million STEM graduates will be needed to meet demand. Additionally, STEM-based careers are expected to outpace traditional job growth and increase by 17 percent over the next decade. However, a 2010 report released by the United States Census Bureau illustrates the widening achievement gap for minorities, with only 19 percent of African Americans and 14 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 having earned a Bachelor’s degree. Our organization will address this disparity and introduce young men and women to STEM though the creation of the LA’s Promise Technology Academy at John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School. We will expose a combined 90 students (40 per school) to STEM-related after school activities. All LA’s Promise Technology Academy participants will attend coding and app development classes, lectures from guest speakers, and/or field trips organized in partnership with Televisa, Univision, Fox Studios, Direct TV, Google, and others. Participants will chronicle their experience through a dedicated blog, video journals, and on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In addition, participating students will be provided with Math and Science tutoring to ensure they excel in the classroom. Use of a digital badge platform such as Mozilla’s Open Badges will track the progress of students and unlock achievements as skills are mastered within each respective curriculum. Activities will be scheduled after school throughout the upcoming 2016-2017 academic school year.","The primary obstacle facing our proposed LA’s Promise Technology Academy is the need to develop a comprehensive curriculum that caters to both incoming and returning students. This will be addressed by establishing an introductory curriculum that exposes students to basic coding and app development. Subsequent years will advance the curriculum by incorporating a greater variety of STEM related activities in subject areas such as Video Game Design, Computer Animation, and Robotics. In addition, a committee comprised of parents, teachers, and students will be established to review program elements and propose necessary changes.","Students from John Muir Middle School, Manual Arts Senior High School, and West Adams Preparatory High School will participate in the LA’s Promise Technology Academy as tracked through attendance logs. LA’s Promise will conduct a qualitative survey to gauge participating students interest in STEM at the start of the program and upon culmination. Baseline data will also be collected during the pilot year to demonstrate potential linkages between after school STEM programming and student academic performance in Math and Science subject areas as well as increases to daily attendance, high school graduation rate, and college enrollment. Intended measurable outcomes include:
 
 1. Expose more than 90 students to STEM-related careers.
 2. More than 75% of participating students will increase their interest in STEM and the pursuit of a related career as measured through surveys.
 3.

People connect over their shared desire for pubic green space and a richer and more rewarding urban environment. LFR provides environmental and social benefits, demonstrating how communities, government agencies, and non-profits can work together to enhance green space and create skill sets for positive environmental change within Los Angeles County.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0CreatePlayLive,"Landscaping for Resilience (LFR), winner of the LA County Board of Supervisor's 2015 Green Leadership Award, is TPF’s proven model for connecting LA residents through environmental action. 
 
 In LFR, TPF partners with volunteer groups, neighborhood councils, and others seeking to convert the landscaping of public spaces in their community to native, drought-tolerant plants. The community groups coordinate volunteers, identify a public site to transform, work with their Neighborhood Council to secure support, and assume long-term maintenance of the site. 
 
 TPF designs the site plan and brings together the community for information sessions about the new landscape and its benefits. TPF directs the volunteers in site preparation and leads them in the installation of the new landscape. The impact is immediately evident: sterile, resource-intensive and/or stressed-looking landscapes are transformed by cooperative action into sustainable ones that celebrate the authentic, natural beauty of the region while serving as neighborhood focal points. Subsequent maintenance workshops teach water-saving irrigation practices, mulching, and weed abatement. All that’s required of the community is enthusiasm, shovels, physical labor (exercise!), and a desire to increase one’s knowledge and enhance one’s community. 
 
 LFR will engage 2,000 residents as volunteers to create and maintain eight public gardens. Volunteers will include adults, high school students, and families who set a very public example of what organized volunteers can accomplish. Regular volunteer maintenance days will ensure that neighbors have continuing opportunities for positive interaction and connection through social media. Much of the project coordination will occur through social media connecting residents with a project- and neighborhood-based network.
 
 LFR will connect neighbors across generations by bringing them together to discuss and create public works. During project conceptualization, design, construction, and throughout maintenance, LFR creates a series of authentic opportunities for public gatherings. The new gardens, generated and maintained by public demand, will serve as focal points for adults to interact with their neighbors, forging cross-generational connections as they share skills and experiences. 
 
 If these projects are located near transit stations, the gardens will increase ridership (as envisioned in the First Last Mile Strategic Plan and Metro Green Place plan).","To complete eight projects within one year is a challenge, especially given the seasonal nature of native plant horticulture. Gardens installed in the fall or early winter benefit from natural cycles to get them established. During other seasons, gardeners must provide enough irrigation to encourage the new root growth naturally triggered by winter rains. Careful timing is essential for LFR to succeed. While TPF has already been contacted by two neighborhood groups who want take part, we need to let others know about the opportunity. Using social media and blogs, we will get the word out quickly so we can lay the ground work for fall installation. During spring we will select partners. Summer will be for education, planning, site preparation, volunteer coordination, and securing government support. Fall will be planting season across the County, with eight native plant gardens going in within a period of twelve weeks. Concentrated effort will forge concentrated connections.","TPF will evaluate the success of LFR on the number of volunteers engaged in educational and work activities, the number of hours volunteers contribute, the level of support from Neighborhood Councils, the number of gardens created through LA2050 and planned for the future, the number of (newly created) #LFR tweets and Facebook posts, and the amount of traditional media coverage. If timing allows and all the sites can be dedicated on the same weekend, we will implement a communications plan that crosses media platforms. 
 
 Water saving is another evaluation method. Given that California native plants use one-third the water (and less energy for transporting and treating that water), it makes sense to landscape native. Landscaping matters because urban areas consume ~20% of California’s water, and ~50% of that water is for outdoor use. We will track water use at the native plants gardens.","Community gardening projects are a growing presence in Los Angeles. While the bulk of community-based gardening focuses on food production, the drought has encouraged people to consider water conservation as a compatible landscaping goal. Several organizations promote landscaping with the primary goal of water conservation or increasing the number of trees in urban settings. As a secondary interest, they incorporate some native plants into their plans.
 
 What is unique about TPF’s project is both TPF’s depth of expertize in native plant horticulture and our goal of disseminating skills for replication. TPF exists to continue the work of Theodore Payne, a pioneering proponent of California native plants and a nurseryman who introduced more than 400 types of natives into cultivation. TPF continues the practice started in 1906 of growing and promoting California native plants for conservation and beauty and for more than 50 years, TPF has been training people how to grow natives in Los Angeles. We have the experience, materials, and skills to create successful public gardens. 
 
 In keeping with the gardening principle that sharing creates more for all, LFR is designed to encourage community volunteerism and public engagement, and impart the sustainable skills needed for partner organizations to continue creating public and private native plant landscapes after the LA2050 project is over. LFR does not position TPF at the center of the project, but as the coach. TPF works with neighborhood groups to achieve their goals and to ensure that the projects will have long-term success but it will be their success. TPF firmly believes that Los Angeles needs more native plants so we need more native plant gardeners. Through LFR, Angelinos will work together to transform the landscape of Los Angeles for our sustainable future.","While each site is different, past LFR projects can serve as a guide to partners. Partnering with Green Space Los Feliz, United States Postal Service, Silver Lake Gardening Club, Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Park, Silver Lake Neighborhood Council, and Los Angeles Police Department, LFR has transformed the landscaping at the Los Feliz Post Office, Silver Lake Meadow, and Topanga LAPD Station. At each site volunteers attended presentations about native plants, installed the new landscape, and now regularly maintain it. Success has bred requests from other groups, such as Mid-town NoHo and Valley Glen Neighborhood Councils, for native landscaping in other public spaces, and native gardens are now more prevalent in the surrounding communities. Through LA2050, TPF will work with neighborhood groups to develop eight public gardens in Los Angeles County.
 
 Each community partner organization will receive approximately $5,900 in direct service and materials including irrigation supplies, plants, and labor to clear the site and install the irrigation. TPF will supply an additional $5,800 of educational programming, site plan creation, coordination, and advise on project coordination.","The total for developing and installing eight new native plant gardens comes to $108,100. Community groups will be encouraged to apply to their Neighborhood Councils for small grants to cover extra expenses. We anticipate that each group will secure $1,000 in support from their Neighborhood Council.
 
 TPF will also contribute in-kind staff support on how to implement the projects, make connections with neighborhood groups, and training in native plant horticulture. TPF will supply plants at the member discount price for this project.","Roughly half of the budget will provide dedicated staffing. The other half will cover materials and labor.
 
 $46,800 for a full-time LFR manager to recruit, train, and coach the community groups and well as contract for labor and buy irrigation materials (if needed). This person’s benefits are calculated at 25%.
 
 Each site will have the following estimated expenses totaling $5,900 (specific requirements will vary by site):
  $2,500 for irrigation and training materials
  $2,900 for labor for removal of existing plants and irrigation installation covers a crew of four people for six 8-hour days at $15/hour
  $500 for 50 plants at $9 each
  $50 for 90 miles travel to visit sites multiple times
 
 $94,000 in direct costs for eight projects
 $14,100 in indirect costs at 15% (administration, computer, etc.)
 
 $108,100 in total costs","One of the real beauties of Landscaping for Resilience is that it can become self-replicating. For example, Green Space Los Feliz was one of TPF's partners in creating a native plant landscape at the Los Feliz post office. Once that group gained skills in horticulture and working together, they went on to work with a local fire station to develop and maintain a garden at their site. 
 
 The goals of the program are to raise awareness among Angelinos of the control they have over their environment, what options they have for exerting that control, how to organize for change, and how to develop sustainable and retainable skills"

5102124,Launching GrowGoods Social Enterprise Business,2015078,,,"GrowGood, Inc., a non-profit organization, has worked since 2011 in partnership with the Salvation Army's Bell Homeless Shelter to transform the 1.5-acre parcel of fallow land adjacent to the Shelter into a small farm. With $100,000, GrowGood will launch its UCLA award-winning social enterprise business plan to build a greenhouse on-site to grow and sell produce year-round to LA’s finest restaurants. The social enterprise business will employ Shelter residents, many of whom are veterans.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The Salvation Army's Bell Shelter in Bell, CA; LA County",Learn,"In 2015, the Los Angeles City Council declared a state of emergency on homelessness. In addition to housing needs, persons who are homeless also often battle with mental illness, substance abuse, physical disability, and/or domestic violence. Furthermore, many homeless people have nutrition-related health problems and need improved access to food and nutrition. It is our opinion that LA can only be as healthy as those least fortunate, and to make LA healthy, we must focus first on this growing population.
 
 GrowGood’s 1.5-acre farm adjacent to the Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter fills this critical gap. Founded in 2011, GrowGood’s mission is to provide a variety of fresh produce to the Shelter’s kitchen; to create a green space for emotional healing; and to provide meaningful job training opportunities for Shelter’s residents. 
 
 Currently, GrowGood’s farm consists of a 50 fruit tree orchard, 14 raised vegetable garden beds, a California native garden, as well as traditional in-ground row crops. GrowGood’s farm continues to provide organic produce to the Shelter’s kitchen - 2,000 lbs of produce this year alone. Moreover, GrowGood also provides garden classes for Shelter residents. In furtherance of its mission, GrowGood will use $100,000 to continue developing its farm as well as to launch its UCLA award-winning social enterprise business to employ Shelter residents and provide meaningful job training. 
 
 To launch the business, GrowGood will install on-site a commercial, climate-controlled 30 x 58 ft greenhouse. The greenhouse will require a foundation, electricity, and plumbing to increase the production scale and to enable year-round cultivation. GrowGood will also need to hire an additional full-time employee as well as lease a truck to deliver product to customers. Residents will be involved in every stage of business. 
 
 In 2014, GrowGood presented this concept to a panel of business leaders at the Social Enterprise Academy at UCLA. GrowGood was awarded 1st place and received a $12,000 prize. Since then, GrowGood has conducted further market research, gained agreement from a talented individual to run the business, and has received approval from the Army to place the greenhouse on-site. By producing a high-quality local product and providing meaningful job training opportunities to the Shelter’s residents, many of whom are veterans, GrowGood is building a replicable model that will make LA the healthiest place to live.","Based on our experience over the past four years, we anticipate a major challenge will be getting consistent resident participation in the social enterprise. Our business plan for putting the $100,000 grant monies to work relies on sourcing Shelter residents as employees. For GrowGood’s social enterprise, the basic premise is that the best way to teach how to be employed is to employ. Residents learn to come to work on time, complete tasks and work with others among other things. This also goes hand in hand with the therapeutic aspect of the program. With that said, we recognize each resident brings a unique set of obligations and issues that may sometimes interfere with their commitment to GrowGood. 
 
 In order to overcome this challenge we will develop and institutionalize the following into our operating model: 1) case worker training and accountability; 2) training and ongoing education; 3) employee reward system; and 4) access to jobs upon completion.","GrowGood will evaluate the program through resident surveys, feedback from key stakeholders (i.e. Shelter staff, especially case managers), and documenting whether resident employees are successfully leveraging their experience with GrowGood to gain full-time employment after their time in the Shelter. Moreover, documenting volunteer hours - additional hours a resident spends at the farm beyond what is required - can also be helpful in determining “success.”","GrowGood is unique because we operate a 1.5-acre farm only 8 miles from downtown LA that produces nutritious, healthy food for Los Angeles’s neediest, and has a enthusiast population of underserved residents only 100 yards away. GrowGood’s social enterprise will empower the homeless by giving residents a chance to grow something of their own and learn valuable skills that they can leverage for future careers. 
 
 Farmscape is an organization whose mission it is “to connect city dwellers with fresh, organic product through a network of urban farms, while creating living wage jobs for the new generation of farmers.” Farmscape is complementary to our work and provides a career pathway for residents who participate in GrowGood’s social enterprise. Other career pathways for Shelter residents might include greenhouse management, customer service and retail, food production, and water efficiency auditing.","GrowGood is closely aligned with the The Salvation Army’s Bell Shelter. Currently, GrowGood occupies the site rent-free and the Salvation Army pays for GrowGood’s utilities. GrowGood and the Army are presently negotiating a long-term lease agreement to formalize the relationship. With that said, the Army has approved GrowGood's plan to construct a greenhouse on-site in order to launch the social enterprise. 
 
 The Salvation Army will not receive any amount from this grant award, although participating Shelter residents will be paid for their work.","A detailed budget for putting the $100,000 to work is outlined below. Coincidentally, this is the same amount as our capital campaign that was recently kicked-off. In addition to the LA 2020 grant monies, GrowGood retains a professional grant writer who is managing targeted outreach efforts to supplement our existing operational budget and to aid in our expansion in 2016.","12 Month Revenue and Expense Projection:

5102208,Leaders + Readers: Bringing Much Needed Books to Children in LAUSD & Beyond,2016148,,,M+B’s LEADERS+READERS program is designed to encourage student volunteers in the Los Angeles community to organize book drives benefiting another Los Angeles based “sister” school. The goal of every Leaders + Readers book drive is to flood underserved Los Angeles schools with the books needed to support learning and academic excellence AND allow students to gain experience with leadership and community service. L+R is leveraging our community’s resources to fill the budget gap that LAUSD faces.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,"Children's Hospital of Orange County, Ronald McDonald House Pasadena, Hillsides Foster Care, Summer Meals Program of Pasadena, Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, Assistance League of Santa Monica, Santa Monica Public Library, The Book Truck, and many more!",ALL,"We at Milk + Bookies believe the sustainability of a literate community depends on the accessibility of books - and underprivileged boys and girls in Los Angeles do not have the books they need to thrive. Yet if children of relative means were taught to recycle surplus books in their homes, all schools in Los Angeles - and by extension, their students - would have the titles so desperately needed to inspire and engage. Enter, Milk + Bookies Leaders + Readers.
 
 Leaders + Readers is a service-learning, book drive program that joins two divergent Los Angeles student communities and results in thousands of books placed into classroom libraries at recipient schools – those most in need of grade and literacy-level appropriate reading material – making L.A. the best place to learn.
 
 Each book drive includes four steps, with Leaders + Readers staff working with student volunteers at L.A. area elementary schools to:
 
 STEP 1: Coordinate the book drives that are run by the student volunteers at donor schools. Leaders + Readers inspires creative marketing and teamwork, culminating in weeklong, all-school book drives.
 
 STEP 2: Sort donated books for quality and reading level, then pack them for delivery. As part of this process, student volunteers write and respond to letters from students at recipient school who anxiously await delivery.
 
 STEP 3: Bring books to the recipient schools. This is an extraordinarily meaningful part of the process for all participants, as students from the schools donating books (generally from upper grades) meet with their buddies at the recipient schools (usually first grade students) to share a snack and a story.
 
 STEP 4: Reflect – post-delivery – on the giving experience with students who organized the drives. For recipient schools, thousands of books are distributed to classroom libraries, the school library, and in some cases, at pop-up “Book Fairs” that allow kids in need to take home books of their own.
 
 This “book flood” presents a proven, win-win strategy. It improves literacy by creating sizable in-class libraries and providing low-income students with easily accessible collections. At the same time, student volunteers apply their collective energy and enthusiasm towards helping less fortunate kids expand their thinking, engage their imaginations and succeed. Whether students are giving or receiving, Leaders + Readers changes their lives, all the while dramatically upgrading the quality of education in L.A.","Numbers present our greatest obstacle. The average student/teacher ratio in LAUSD is 30:1. In some areas, the ratio is double that. What this means is that teachers are often too overtasked to participate in programs, like the book drives offered by Leaders + Readers. LAUSD’s dwindling budget makes this difficulty even greater, with teachers being asked to provide crucial materials for their students out of their own pockets. In response to these classroom realities, we have streamlined our program so that teachers have all of the assistance they need for their students to participate in the Leaders + Readers curriculum. We handle all of the logistics and gather all of the necessary materials to help bring our valuable program to students without overwhelming teachers or taxing school budgets.","Milk+Bookies recognizes the importance of evaluation in gauging the sustainability of our Leaders+Readers program. To that end, we shall continue to measure the impact of our work – and the lasting effect that our book drives have on student education – by focusing on particular metrics. 
 
 For schools participating in our service-learning programs, forms will be completed by teachers, surveys conducted, and student volunteers interviewed to determine (1) when in the school year book drives have been most successful, (2) the number of books collected (per classroom and in total), and (3) the process by which schools have become involved with Leaders + Readers. 
 
 We will solicit experiential feedback from teachers, students and administrators. Recipient schools will complete questionnaires about the process, and the reactions of children receiving books will be similarly recorded. The information gleaned will be used to encourage other schools to participate going forward.","In early 2015, Milk + Bookies absorbed the book drive program previously operated by BookEnds and formed Leaders + Readers. Our program now represents the only one of its kind in Los Angeles, the metropolitan area having the highest illiteracy rate in the United States. Upon absorbing BookEnds, Milk + Bookies organized Leaders + Readers to improve the financial stability of the book drive program and to realize a more significant long-term impact.
 
 What makes the Leaders + Readers program unique is its commitment to inspire a generation of boys and girls to become engaged citizens by connecting economically diverse communities and encouraging these children to take a stand to solve the literacy problem plaguing our schools. The stark reality is that LAUSD has more than 225,000 elementary students under Title 1. It is the objective of Milk + Bookies, through Leaders + Readers, to avail these youngsters – who would otherwise be at an extreme educational disadvantage – of a brighter future. In the process, children on the other end of the spectrum – those of relative means – are instilled with the core value of purpose and introduced to the power of giving and the joy of impacting positive change for the greater good.","Grant awards will not be shared with third-party partners or collaborators. While Leaders + Readers is supported by Annie’s Homegrown, which provides snack packs for the children at our book deliveries, Annie’s receives no financial compensation. To be clear, Leaders + Readers is administered by Milk + Bookies, a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation that consists of a small, vital and committed staff of three full-time employees. Supporting this team are a group of two-to-three student interns, a five-member Board of Directors, and a crew of volunteers provided by EarthAngels.","The Leaders + Readers program budget for 2015-2016 is $125,000. This amount covers ALL of the operational costs associated with running the Leaders + Readers programs. To cover the $25,000 shortfall, we plan to leverage our relationships with various corporate and philanthropic partners to secure small grants. Milk + Bookies also organizes fundraisers, one of which took place in early August and garnered $5,000 to support the Leaders + Readers program.","To place this response in context, understand that Leaders + Readers strives to convert every $1 of program expense into $8 worth of books. We sampled the value of more than 200 donated books, comparing their value to the current listings of used books (those of similar title and quality) for sale on Amazon.com. On average, each book collected by Leaders + Readers has a value of $8.33. With a goal to raise over 100,000 books during the 2015-2016 school year, the Leaders + Readers program seeks to amass over $800,000 worth of books on a $125,000 budget. That is a 640% return on investment.
 
 Contemplating an award of $100,000, our budget will be as follows:
 
 Expenses:
  
 Salary and Payroll: $65,000
 
 Rent and Storage:  $16,500
 
 Program Supplies: $10,000
 
 Transportation:  $4,000
 
 Administrative:  $4,500
 
 TOTAL  $100,000","Milk+Bookies has over ten years of experience in inspiring “future philanthropists” and spreading the love of reading. We have seen the success of our program expand all over the country, with hosted events occurring in over 500 cities and books distributed to more than 540 underprivileged children’s groups nationwide. Being a Los Angeles-based organization, we have seen up close the extent of L.A.’s literacy problem and are uniquely positioned to focus our efforts locally to optimally manage the Leaders + Readers program.
 
 In terms of scaling the program, that process is already underway at Milk+Bookies. Book drives are taking place; we are aware of the materials required; we have forged relationships that will carry us forward into future school years; and we have the information and know-how necessary to implement this project in a much larger way. Fact is, in the second half of the 2014-2015 school year, Leaders + Readers raised over 58,000 books and impacted 10,000 students. With the grant money, we will be able to double our already impressive efforts and reach our goal of raising 100,000 books and positively influencing 20,000 students in the coming school year.
 
 Children are entitled to learn to their greatest potential, but this cannot be achieved without reading competency. Such competency is impossible without access to books, which – by definition – are fundamental to the development of reading. However, the stark reality is that students from underserved communities are most affected by a scarcity of books; in Los Angeles, these are predominantly children from low-income, minority backgrounds. Consider the following: in the LAUSD, the average book to student ratio is 2:1 or 3:1; the national average is 22:1. Incredibly, 7,000,000 books are needed just to bring Los Angeles schools up to the national average. Bare and outdated libraries with little to no governmental support critically handicap our students and are leading to lower test scores, lower rates of graduation, and poor literacy overall.
 
 Once Leaders+Readers is appropriately scaled, the LAUSD statistics are expected to reflect the following historical data:
  
 • 95% of teachers report an increase in student reading after receiving donated books;
 
 • Students with access to a variety of reading material have higher than average test scores; and
 
 • Narrowing the “achievement gap” leads to lower truancy rates and increases in confidence and academic achievement."

5102231,Learning Through Dual Language Immersion,2016164,,,"As Los Angeles has become increasingly more diverse, the Patrick Henry Foundation was established to obtain funds to increase dual immersion education throughout Los Angeles beginning at the elementary school level.
 
 Patrick Henry Foundation was established by parents of Patrick Henry Elementary, one of Long Beach's most established and well-recognized Spanish/English dual immersion education programs in order to raise funds to provide increased educational opportunities to students in LA.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Patrick Henry Elementary School, Long Beach, CA",Learn,"Substantial research and scholarly articles have touted the benefits of bilingual and multilingual education as a means of increasing connectivity among groups, overcoming stereotypes, creating stronger social bonds and increasing both the intelligence and emotional state of students as they become adults. 
 
 Education Secretary Arne Duncan has regularly voiced his support and the need for additional resources to be devoted to dual language instruction as a means for creating more well-rounded native English speakers and increasing the graduation and success rates of English-language learners.
 
 The 90-10 model, which is based off Canada's model of teaching native English speakers French and vice versa, has shown that those immersed in a two-way language educational model from elementary school often outperform their peers who are only learning in one language, including in language arts and math.
 
 The California Department of Education lists 201 current schools that offer some form of dual immersion, 58 of which are located in Los Angeles County, which represents almost 30% of all dual immersion programs in California. This year, the Association of Two-Way & Dual Language Education (ATDLE), a national organization providing resources and implementation for dual immersion programs throughout the United States, awarded Patrick Henry Elementary with its Certificate of Excellence Award for dual language education. Only one school is given the award per year out of more than 1,000 dual immersion schools overseen by ATDLE.
 
 The award and longstanding success of Patrick Henry Elementary demonstrates why the Patrick Henry Foundation is positioned to make Los Angeles the best to learn. Last year, we funded iPads and 3D printers for two pilot projects at Patrick Henry Elementary and neighboring Keller Middle School. The iPads are being used to incorporate digital learning methods into the dual language model with great success. Likewise, the 3D printer pilot project has enabled increased creativity and art through experiential learning.
 
 Additional resources will allow the Patrick Henry Foundation to convert the successes of the pilot project into fully funded ongoing educational opportunities throughout Los Angeles. 
 
 The Patrick Henry Foundation also created a program entitled Beyond the Bell that offers a variety of enrichment courses both before and after school, including chess, music and engineering. Extra funding would increase this programs reach.","One of the barriers that we have faced to date, and will likely continue to face, is the administrative delays that are often associated with large public school districts. For example, iPads purchased through Long Beach Unified or another school district in Los Angeles are property of the school, are maintained by them and insured by them. However, there are significant delays from the date of purchase to the date of delivery that often prevent organizations from being able to quickly adapt to new technologies and needs.
 
 One way we have overcome this barrier is by making direct purchases through the foundation and donating them to the specific school site, which enables us to monitor the resources, track them, insure them and exercise greater control. In doing so, we can cut through delays when needed and innovate far quicker than we would be able to do otherwise.","Our board regularly meets to evaluate the progress of the foundation. We have internal policies and procedures in place to track the data with respect to how our donations have benefited the school and what programs are working more than others.
 
 Fortunately, we have been able to target highly dedicated teachers and staff members who volunteer their time because they want the additional educational tools and resources the foundation can provide outside the normal channels from a publicly funded request. As a result, the staff and teachers, who are liaisons to the board, monitor and report back on the programs implemented by the foundation, which we then double check.
 
 The foundation also conducts annual surveys of staff, faculty, students and parents of the schools we service in order to obtain feedback. Our 2014 survey results, in conjunction with the California Office to Reform Education (CORE) survey, demonstrates Patrick Henry is one of the highest rated programs.","There are other Los Angeles based non-profit organizations focused on providing extracurricular and enrichment opportunities to students beginning in elementary school. There are also organizations formed out of parent endowed programs from specific elementary schools, middles schools and high schools that raise funds to enhance educational opportunities.
 
 However, the Patrick Henry Foundation is unique in that its focus is on expanding education and social bonds through dual language learning and arts. We have modeled ourselves on the best practices of other foundations and organizations that have a similar focus on single language learning and combined those practices with organizations that promote cultural diversity and language skills.
 
 In doing so, we have created a niche focus in the dual immersion and language arts sector of elementary schools and our goal is grow our programs and export our model to other neighboring schools to increase bilingual and multilingual education and arts.","The Patrick Henry Foundation is a standalone organization. While we have received directed funds from various organizations, such as the WM Keck Foundation, for science-related projects, we do not have direct partners or collaborators who would receive a portion of any funds granted. 
 
 That said, several other neighboring schools have contacted the foundation and expressed an interest in having similar organizations established at their respective school sites. Additional funds would enable the foundation to export our programs to other elementary schools in need.
 
 Should the grant be awarded, the entirety of the funds would be accounted for in creating and implementing dual language education programs and pilot projects at our current location, which are in great need, with the goal of expanding our reach to other neighboring institutions if applicable.","In 2014, the foundation raised just over $58,000, with 84% being donated directly back to various project funding requests of the school, teachers, staff, parents and students (all with a focus on dual language learning).
 
 We are currently on target to double the amount of funds raised this year through direct donations from parents and stakeholders, partnerships with local businesses and various fundraising events that raise awareness about dual language learning. 
 
 Grant funding is an additional resource that will enable us to cover the unfunded requests of our faculty, teachers and students, which are voluminous. For example, converting the iPad pilot project into a fully funded project at just Patrick Henry Elementary would cost more than $60,000 for equipment, training and implementation. Those costs would reduce for subsequent years until equipment needed to be replaced, which we estimate to be every 2-3 years.
 
 While the grant would cover a substantial amount of requests, there are always needs for additional funds in public schools to increase educational opportunities for students.","Our project goals are constantly developing based on requests of teachers, faculty, students and parents, with the approval and oversight of the foundation.
 
 A $100,000 grant would be used to expand current pilot programs and purchase additional equipment and tools for dual language learning as follows:
 
 1) $62,715.91 would allow us to purchase 5 iPads, cases, and insurance, with taxes and shipping, for each of the 19 classrooms in need (dual language and arts skills);
 2) $6,500 for purchase of applications, software and licensing for dual language programs (dual language skills);
 3) $2,500 for training on implementation of new equipment in classroom (dual language skills);
 4) $25,165 for 7 Robo 3D printers and 7 HP Stream 13 inch laptops with printing filament and taxes included (dual language engineering and arts skills);
 5) $3,119.09 for increased Beyond the Bell learning programs (dual language, arts, engineering, music and cultural courses)
 
 Cost overruns covered by foundation.","A successful grant application and implementation of the proposed projects would allow the foundation to leverage our current stakeholders for additional targeted contributions. Success tends to beget success and if our current donors, local businesses and parent community are able to see the results on a grand scale, we can use those successes to increase our likelihood of obtaining ongoing funds from other sources."

 A recent study, by the National Center for Learning and Citizenship, supports the view that “high quality service-learning has a statistically significant and positive relationship with students’ acquisition of 21st century skills.” Local, national & global community outreach efforts positively impact our community, teach civic responsibility and motivate students to LEARN. Through service-learning, students LEARN that they can make a difference and be active citizens. Through active LEARNING they discover that they have a voice and how to use it. 
 
 Our service-learning model will integrate the community through authentic lessons in all subject areas. Many subjects will be tied to a garden-based curriculum delivered through the process of growing and harvesting produce for our local Giving Bank’s weekly food distribution and local restaurants supplying our school lunch program. Outdoor education will be expanded to cover environmental topics and relate them to our immediate community through the development of a large scale recycling program and a neighborhood improvement fund. Media literacy will be incorporated, in the forms of student broadcasting and public service announcements, to teach student the importance of analyzing and critiquing the local and global topics in which they will be immersed. 
 
 Our service-learning model will immediately impact the over 550 school and religious education students we serve. This includes students from preschool through high school citywide, creating an integrated network of support. Sharing our strategies will enable our program to reach far beyond our immediate campus to the many schools we partner with. Additionally, we will make our new curriculum design available to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds through a community summer program with scholarships.","Logistics of time and space remain an ongoing challenge in education. Common Core standards, benchmarks and curriculum time requirements often leave teachers overextended. This challenge is one of the main obstacles that we hope to overcome by developing a comprehensive curriculum model to provide an engaging framework to teach these educational requirements. With the right design, we believe service-learning can be liberally used as an institutional strategy to meet learning goals and Common Core standards. Overcoming these obstacles will involve developing a Guiding Coalition, a team of three teachers representing each grade cluster, to design, implement and create a relevant and replicable service-learning curriculum that will enhance and augment learning standards.","The successful implementation of a service-learning model program will require systems for reporting, collecting and analyzing data. The Principal and Guiding Coalition will document and analyze the growth of this program through the following methods: 
 
 1. Individual student portfolios. The student portfolios will consist of written evaluations and work samples from all subject areas displaying how service-learning enhances lessons. These portfolios will be assessed by the Guiding Coalition quarterly. 
 2. Faculty assessment & collaboration. Quarterly classroom observations and written evaluations will be completed for each individual teacher by the Guiding Coalition. This will also serve as an opportunity for teachers to build a shared knowledge of service-learning goals & strategies. 
 3. Overall program. A system will be developed by the Guiding Coalition for collecting data and organizing the service-learning curriculum into a comprehensive manual to be shared with other schools.","There are many schools and nonprofits working to implement a more vibrant future for our school system through innovative education. In a comprehensive study by the Center for Education Reform (CER) it was discovered that, for the most part, the school system operates on a model that worked a half-century ago but fails to account for a wholly different social structure and education environment in our nation today. What makes our approach unique is our adoption of a comprehensive service-learning model in a truly collaborative effort with a variety of schools and community partners.","Mutually-beneficial partnerships make up the core of an impactful service-learning model and we know that we are strengthened through collaboration and community impact. Notably, our collaboration and leadership role with our economically disadvantaged partner schools (Dolores Mission, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Assumption and St. Alphonsus) throughout East Los Angeles, will be enhanced through documented implementation methods around this service-learning model. For the past decade, Holy Family staff, students, parents and parishioners have committed time and resources to bring these schools new educational, drama, theater and art programs, text books, computers, playground equipment and school supplies. Our service-learning curriculum advancements and shared resources will be on ongoing opportunity to advance in solidarity with these schools. 
 
 Additional direct community partnerships will include: growing produce for the Holy Family Giving Bank weekly food distribution; supplying herbs and vegetables to local restaurants that supply our school hot lunch program; shared resources and joint faculty and student service-learning lessons in collaboration with our partner schools; as well as countless partnerships as part of our non-profit of the month service-learning partnerships with some examples including the Center for Restorative Justice Works (an organization providing assistance to children of the incarcerated), Hillsides for Abused Children and Project Haiti.","The program will have one-time, start-up costs of $100,000 to implement and develop a replicable model. Following the start-up year the program will be sustained by the school budget.","Faculty stipends to design and implement the program $25,000
 Faculty development $15,000
 Expanded resources/curriculum materials for the learning garden, outdoor classroom & multimedia component $40,000
 Replication manual materials $5,000
 Shared resources with partner schools $15,000","As a pilot school for many projects in the archdiocese of Los Angeles, Holy Family implements programs that exist for the benefit of our greater community. The true measurement of success will be for the benefits of our service-learning program to reach beyond our own students and truly exemplify ways that integrated service enhances learning and impacts the world around us. Particularly in our commitment to partner with and guide economically disadvantaged schools, our model’s success will be measured by a successful and replicable guide for implementing creative service-learning into all aspects of an enhanced curriculum."
5102060,Learning to Save Lives: Training Future Lifeguards and Water Rescuers,2016039,,,"Geared for youth ages 9-17, the Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates during the summer at two open water locations within the City. Taught by certified lifeguards, our Program is competitive and rigorous, providing instruction in physical conditioning, competition skills, and the use of professional lifesaving equipment. Our Program is designed to educate and impassion youth to appreciate and respect the marine environment and introduce youth to a career choice in water safety.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Hansen Dam, Lake View Terrace, CA; Cabrillo Beach, San Pedro, CA",Live,"I would like to create KIPP, a Kids Indoor Play Park for all young children (baby, infant, toddler) to participate in and develop social and physical motor skills, both individually and with each other. Many outdoor playgrounds aren't designed for the younger age groups, but KIPP's will be created just for them, a place where parents and caretakers can feel secure in knowing their children are in a good environment. The equipment will be similar to an indoor children's gym, with soft mats, tumbling shapes, and age-appropriate apparatuses that are both colorful and engaging. The equipment can be portable, allowing for easy set-up and clean-up at a multi-use facility so as not to interfere with current programming. KIPP's will be offered at numerous City of LA parks inside the recreation facilities. Participation for the children will be either free or low cost so as to encourage and include as many children in the community as possible. This type of programming will offer networking and social interfacing among the children and between parents/caretakers. It will also create a connection between parents/caretakers and park staff, which may then lead to ongoing participation in other park programs in the future. By developing the relationship between the park and community, the City can learn about its residents and better serve the public.","I anticipate encountering the challenge of working through the City's approval process for obtaining/purchasing the items needed for KIPP, as well as, any approval needed to host such program at the desired parks. The City has policies for vendors that make using City funds difficult, at times. If the funds are ""donated"" into the City's general account, then I will have to patiently work through the purchasing process. If the funds can be awarded and the items paid for directly from the source, then it will be easier and quicker to obtain the items needed. I will take the initiative to propose KIPP to the park supervisors, and then to the park commission, as needed. I will also be willing do research in order to to train park staff on proper usage of the equipment to ensure safety and on programming ideas to design a variety of activities that will benefit the children and get the most use of KIPP (classes, workshops, games, etc).","I will choose a pilot park, or parks, to survey to see which one(s) have a need for this type of programming. After selecting the parks and implementing the program I plan to conduct biweekly/monthly evaluations on the program with feedback from park staff, program participants, and non-participants who frequent the park. I'll also observe the activity to review firsthand how the KIPP is utilized and received by both children and parents/caretakers. I'll see what's liked by the children and what other ideas they would like to see at the KIPP. I will make note of any safety hazards and make sure they are dealt with in a timely manner. I'll also see how participation varies when the program is offered at no expense verses a nominal fee.","Yes, there are other organizations that provide this type of activity. However, they are private, for-profit entities (like Gymboree) that aren't readily accessible to the communities throughout the City of LA. What's unique about my proposed approach is my ability to initiate this type of program within the City's Department of Recreation and Parks and offer it on a more widespread scale for free, or a much lower fee than the other businesses. I am currently a Facility Director employed with the City of Los Angeles who recently had a baby, so I have both the connection within the City, as well as, a direct need and interest in such program on a personal level...which will keep me engaged in this endeavor.","I am currently involved with the Playa Vista Moms Group (PVMG) in which I am co-chair of events. This group provides resources and connections to moms living in Playa Vista. I am also involved with Women In Leisure Services (WILS), a professional organization that connects women working in the recreation field to each other for resources, guidance, and networking purposes. Both clubs are non-profit organizations that I can utilize to aid in the production and promotion of the KIPP. I'm also a member of Alpha Phi Fraternity in which I can connect to chapters at various universities in Los Angeles to seek out college women studying related majors that may want to assist with the research and production of the KIPP. I anticipate that both PVMG and WILS will receive about $2,000 each for their part in the project and Alpha Phi receiving about $3000 for their contribution to the project. I anticipate need the bulk of the grant money to purchase equipment and any other start up costs for the project (like staff fees).","I think this project will cost the full $100,000. This amount will include the planning, implementation, managing, and evaluation of the project. It will also include City costs to support such a program as long as it can before it can be left up to each park to find funding to self-sustain the program.","The estimated budget for this project is as follows: 
 
 $2000 = Playa Vista Moms Group
 $2000 = Women In Leisure Services
 $3000 = Alpha Phi Fraternity
 $43,000 = Staff Fees
 $40,000 = Equipment Fees
 $10,000 = Miscellaneous Fees (research, potential partners, cleaning fees, permit fees, unforeseen costs)","I plan to review all forms of evaluation and personally involve my friends, family and myself with the project. In working with the City of LA's Department of Recreation and Parks I hope to gain their support and implement the project at as many parks as possible. By adopting my idea, the City of LA can then budget for this program in the future. Kids Indoor Play Parks will fill the void left by the City of LA when they had to terminate their licensed preschool programs. Additionally, KIPP will fulfill the need for programming for babies, infants, and toddlers that the City of LA does not currently provide."
5102014,Let Ambulante connect new audiences to your nonprofit thru public documentary screenings all year,2015007,,,"Ambulante's annual community tour has been so successful there is a demand from our nonprofit partners for our projection and curatorial expertise. With this grant two of our most experienced staff members can be compensated during off-season to: field partnership requests and organize support at the scale we can successfully deliver, including;operation and use of our outdoor projection system, leveraging our industry contacts to secure films and negotiate lower screening fees, cross promotion.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"The past two editions of our community driven, month long documentary tour has proven our experiment of intervening public spaces with documentary storytelling is a signficant and unique way to capture the interest of a general public who were not actively seeking, or expecting to be interested in the vast number of social justice, music culture and creative issues and genres documentaries offer. At all of our outdoor events passersby stumbled upon us and sat down and became involved in the subject at hand by asking a question, giving us their email. This kind of informal access point is crucial for nonprofits to significantly expand awareness outside their already dedicated base. By including people who are left out of the conversation the conversations are elevated and civic participation in the subject is exponentially increased. Our events connect people to share one communal experience, people from very different classes, age and orientations. Since we work with over 40 partners our scalability is where our full potential can be unleashed.","The biggest challenge I've faced when persuading funders and sponsors on paper - people who have not been out to experience the impact, is that Ambulante is not a film festival, and therefore should not be limited to funding because of this erroneous category description. Ambulante is a community enrichment program that is key for economic growth and educational opportunities, and creates lifetime intangible impact on people it touches. So while funding is our number one challenge to keep Ambulante thriving, I'm proud to say when it comes to the caliber and extraordinary access to PROGRAMMING, we stand alone. From the ability to program innovative work that debuts in fancy festivals like Cannes and Sundance, to selectinglocal short films made by youth right here in LA,which we screen through our submissions call, our curatorial voice and programming expertise is by far our biggest strength which I therefore feel imperative to share with our network of nonprofits who lack programming.","Our evaluations will come directly from our community partners. We solicit feedback from audiences and filmmakers and have developed a specific form for our partners asking them to candidly rate our communication and production skills. It is a comprehensive page long inquiry on ""What worked well, what did not work and how we may improve for next collaboration"". Feedback from audiences, filmmakers and partners is gathered and talked about on a scheduled day long staff retreat wrap day so that we can also share overheard comments not documented. The benefit of Ambulante's amorphous quality is that the feedback informs our perpetual iteration. Each time we do another screening we have the opportunity of learning from hundreds of distinct locations and when we go back to the same communities we have the feedback that is specific to that neighborhood. Our goal would be to have an overall positive evaluation of the contribution we bring and how we fulfill our deliverables.","There is no other organization that I know of that offers this level of specialized documentary program in public spaces on wheels so that it can travel directly to under served neighborhoods using as deep of a level of local community collaboration. We are unique in every sense. We do not use the typical festivals' imperialistic, or inserted approach of choosing a random film and expecting an obvious demographic to be interested let alone come to an an anchor venue and pay for admission. While it may look like a pop up festival in that we pop up in different communities every single night during the tour, that night is preceded by at least five community meetings with local partners to gauge interest, do collective outreach, and add other creative elements to the experience.","We have a list of nonprofit partners who we have worked with on more than two events now, who we would like to continue to work with year round to sustain their own activities and fundraising. This grant will allow us to offset their costs that they put into the work of promoting our joint screenings. They include From Lot to Spot, East LA Community Corporation, SRO Housing Corportation, Casa Libre, and Legacy LA. It depends on the scale of each event but yes we are prepared to absorb a certain amount of costs corresponding to their labor in fulfilling our collaborative efforts of raising awareness for each event and being onsite at the screenings to promote our partnerships.","This grant is earmarked for our production and activities off-season and we have budgeted accordingly to ensure at least 10 successful hands on events reaching at least 1500 people, plus 10 co-presentations which won't require as much of our hands on labor but a significant investment of time in social media and contacts.","POSITION / EXPENSE AMOUNT COST TOTAL ACTUAL

5102048,Lets Build Bridges Between Communities And Our Dream LA By Celebrating LA County Innovation Broadly,2015028,,,"In the past two years, the LAEDC has created a hotbed of innovation that showcases the best novel technologies and advanced ideas in the LA County. Our aim is to inspire Angelinos and create a more cohesive community through curating innovation events across the region.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,ALL,"Los Angeles County Innovation week has grown exponentially in the two years since its inception, and it will continue to grow under the stewardship of the Center for Innovation at the LAEDC. LAIW focuses on creating an ecosystem of innovation where the brightest and most unique ideas can flourish. We accomplish this through connecting businesses, resources, organizations, and entrepreneurs across LA County to amplify innovation. LAIW also creates a greater sense of community among the innovators in Los Angeles, and builds bridges between groups and communities who might not otherwise collaborate or interact. 
 
 In the 15th century the Medici family brought together people from all disciplines, including sculpture, science, poetry, philosophy, painting, and architecture. This produced one of the most innovative eras in world history, the Renaissance. Los Angeles is currently in the midst of its own renaissance and Innovation Week allows innovators from the city to explore fields that they would not normally be exposed to and apply this knowledge to the innovation that is taking place at their own companies and organizations. LAIW celebrates innovation broadly. This year’s 150 events highlight innovation in myriad categories including: food, art, fashion, sports, entertainment, information technology, philanthropy, biotechnology, transportation, aerospace, environment, health, mindfulness and civic and social innovation. The breadth of innovation showcased serves to provide access to all communities and fosters a sense of inclusion and connectivity across the region. 
 
 Innovation is generally thought of as beneficial for profit maximizing, but the effects can also be realized through an increase in the sustainable impact that a company has on the city. Many of the companies highlighted at this year’s events have strongly integrated social responsibility into their business model. This further allows for the effects of innovation week to be felt through all communities in Los Angeles. Innovation in socially responsible practices creates a possibility for higher profits, as well as a positive effect on the diverse communities in Los Angeles.","One of the major barriers that we face is that Los Angeles County is 88 cities, but the sectors that are particularly innovative are in very specific parts of the city (i.e. gaming in Santa Monica, etc.). We need to broaden our scope and find innovation happening outside of the obvious connections. With sufficient resources, we will be able to overcome this barrier. 
 
 One of our other main constraints is time. There is so much happening in LA all the time. This year, we expanded the event to three weeks and we were able to showcase many different sectors, even within this time restraint. Creativity loves constraint! 
 
 Another constraint this year was that, given our limited resources, we relied mostly on word of mouth and social media for our marketing campaign. There is a strong necessity for an even more targeted marketing campaign. With sufficient resources we would be able to implement a more comprehensive and strategic marketing campaign.","As we move through LAIW2015, we are actively surveying all of our event hosts and participants. 
 
 For event hosts we are interested in understanding their successes, attendance and impact. We are also inquiring as to what we can do better to promote and support their individual events.
 
 For constituents, we are interested in their overall experience, what they feel they learned and if they will come back next year. We are also asking what we can do better.
 
 On the marketing front, we have established key performance indicators and are gathering metrics around reach, visibility and social influence.","There are many organizations in Los Angeles County working to showcase various aspects of the innovation ecosystem. No one is working anywhere near our scope or scale. From the outset, we haven't viewed any other organization as a competitor, but rather everyone as potential allies. We subscribe to the African proverb: If you want to go far, go together. We are most proud of the fact that LAIW2015 has over 150 event partners including CicLAvia, CarsLA, DigitalLA, Innovate Pasadena, the city of Long Beach, General Assembly, Cross Campus, WeWork, and the Idea Hub.",These resources will be utilized entirely by the Center for Innovation to build LAIW2016 into a global recognized festival.,"To reach the scale of SXSW or Art Basel Miami, we will ultimately need to raise 1 million dollars. The additional costs will be covered through corporate and philanthropic sponsorship.","COST

5102170,Lets Create Innovation Space for LA Biotech,2015109,,,"Our goal, and our vision for the Los Angeles of 2050 is a vibrant network of affordable, accessible biotech incubators across the LA metro region, where life science innovators from any background can access the facilities and equipment they need to move their ideas forward. 
 
 At LabLaunch-Monrovia, we will provide high-quality laboratory space, state-of-the-art shared equipment, and a supportive innovation community, giving biotech startups a place to take root in Los Angeles.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,Monrovia; Monrovia USD; LA County; City of LA,Learn,"Los Angeles is home to several world-class research universities, and thousands of talented young scientists. However, there is little entry-level business incubation space for biotech startups, and the few incubator facilities that exist for more mature, growth-stage companies are consistently at or near full capacity. As a result, many scientists and inventors from Los Angeles are moving to other areas that are perceived as more supportive, such as San Francisco and San Diego, to start their biotech businesses.
 
 Life science technologies are predicted to be among the leading growth industries of the 21st Century. Innovations in healthcare are leading the way to future generations of drugs and healthcare products that will treat illnesses earlier and more effectively, prolonging and increasing the quality of human health. New advances in bioenergy and biosynthesis promise to allow our society to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by producing energy, pharmaceuticals, and other products without relying on chemical feedstocks. Biotechnology represents the best technological hope we have to effectively feed the 7 billion-plus people on Earth, and the larger generations to come. Los Angeles is also home to leaders in the new commercial space age – if they are to be successful in creating long-term human occupation of outer space, they will need many new life science technologies to be developed to keep humans fed, healthy, and safe for long periods away from the Earth.
 
 Creating an open, affordable space in Los Angeles for life science startups, along with business support and access to investors and advisors, is essential to reverse the current trend of young companies moving to San Francisco or San Diego to found their businesses. Our facility at LabLaunch-Monrovia will allow research discoveries from Los Angeles’ universities to stay in LA, grow into successful businesses, employ staff from the LA area, and lay down a strong foundation for the economy of the 21st Century. 
 
 By 2050, some of the early startups that were supported by our incubator will have grown into large, successful businesses, employing thousands of people across Los Angeles. The founders of these successful companies will become the next generation of investors, as they use the profits from their success to invest capital into new innovations. Through this new community, we will be able to anchor a self-perpetuating cycle of success and innovation in biotechnology for LA.","A common roadblock to all business incubators is how the incubator can be self-sustaining, while offering high-level services to its residents. Businesses that have been successful in this space have overcome two key barriers: acquiring support from local government and developing strong links to an active investment community. 
 
 We plan to address both of these issues directly: building on our collaboration with the City of Monrovia, we will work with local cities and the County of Los Angeles to identify potential sites for incubator facilities and resolve any issues with zoning and construction that are necessary to this endeavor. We will work to identify areas of mutual interest with cities that prioritize high-tech business development. With our local partners, we will build a community of investors to support startups at LabLaunch-Monrovia. We will also investigate opportunities to partner with venture capital to accelerate the growth of our startup residents.","Our mission is focused on creating an environment that will foster the creation of high-growth startup businesses. Our metrics of success will therefore be focused on the number and success of our startup tenants, and the number of jobs they create in Los Angeles.
 Specifically, we aim to collect and measure the following metrics to evaluate our success:
 
 -Number of startups launched
 -Number of LA area jobs created by a) our facility b) our tenant startups
 -Total private investment in a) our facility b) our tenant startups
 -Total public funding (i.e. state/federal research grants) in a) our facility b) our tenant startups
 -Public valuation of companies that have graduated from our incubator","An early-stage biotech incubator would be a unique asset in Los Angeles. Similar entities already exist in the San Francisco Bay Area (QB3, Berkeley BioLabs, CounterCulture Labs, BioCurious) and San Diego (Bio,Tech and Beyond, J-Labs).
 
 In the LA area, we have one active incubator in Pasadena (Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative) that caters to growth-stage startups (i.e. companies that already have significant funding). Additionally, Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative is near capacity, so they have limited space to serve new startups. We are also working with LA Biohackers, a citizen science group. LA Biohackers maintains a small coworking lab in DTLA, but does not have the facilities necessary to commercialize their innovations. A facility such as we are proposing would be necessary for their members to take the next step in turning a discovery into a product that investors would be willing to help develop.
 
 A biotech incubator that focuses on early-stage companies, with coworking space and shared equipment, fills a gap that exists between the work of academic and citizen scientists in LA, and the availability of space and funding to commercialize their ideas.","The following groups/businesses are confirmed as partners in this project and have committed to provide no cost advice and support for our efforts as follows:
 
 City of Monrovia - We recently agreed to a partnership with the City of Monrovia, whereby LabLaunch-Monrovia will create an internship program to allow advanced high school students the opportunity to experience life in a real biotech business environment and develop practical skills early on in their careers. Additionally, we will be organizing “Monrovia Biotech Day” to promote biotech advancement to the broader community of the San Gabriel Valley and encourage more innovators to turn their ideas into new products and technologies.
 
 MADIAtech - MADIA Tech Launch is a career, company, and industry incubator, established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation and providing educational services to the region's technical, scientific, and industrial workforce. This region includes Monrovia, Arcadia, Duarte, Irwindale, Azusa, and surrounding areas. They offer educational programs including, but not limited to, entrepreneurship, business finance and operations, and technology development and commercialization.
 
 Southern California Biomedical Council (SoCalBio) – This trade association for life sciences in Southern California will provide the startups launched through our incubator with access to investors and professional services. Their regular investor events will provide a venue for our resident companies to pitch their businesses, raise capital, and network with other industry professionals. The development of an incubator with coworking and open meeting space will provide groups such as SoCalBio with a dedicated place to hold meetings and events for the biotech industry and its investors.
 
 Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative – This life science incubator in Pasadena currently supports 18 companies. Their constituency and goals are sufficiently different from ours that the two organizations benefit, rather than compete with one another. The PBC will offer experienced advice about running a life science incubator and access to an existing base of investors and supporters of the life sciences industry from the San Gabriel Valley. Our project will be mutually beneficial by expanding available space for startups, providing a link between the LA Basin and San Gabriel Valley biotech communities, and enhancing the connections between innovators and investors across the LA region.","In order to acquire the necessary shared equipment and complete physical development of the LabLaunch-Monrovia incubator, we will need to raise $200,000. Our total costs for operation of our facility for 5 years (not including revenues generated from the facility) is $1.5M.
 
 With support from LA2050, we will have sufficient capital to move forward on completion of our facilities at LabLaunch-Monrovia. The specific goals for the first year of our program are:
 
 1) Complete the acquisition of a range of high-quality shared equipment that will support a wide variety of startups in developing their technologies at low cost.
 2) Recruit resident startups to our coworking labs and office space and begin assisting companies by organizing workshops and other educational events.
 3) Identify more sites for incubator facilities in strategic locations across the Los Angeles area and partner with developers and investors to begin the process of planning renovation and construction.
 4) Bring together a network of investors that will commit to supporting the incubator and its resident startups going forward. Work with partners to establish an investment fund or angel group that will be available to provide intimate business growth support and investment (i.e. an accelerator program) to the biotech startups in our incubator.
 
 With $100,000 in startup funding from the LA2050 competition, we believe that these aims are very achievable for our project. A key focus for our team will be to build on this award by reaching out to the broader philanthropic community, the general public, and state/federal grant agencies for funding. With a professional staff and the publicity from the LA2050 competition, we believe that we can raise the amount of funding that will be necessary to drive this project to full completion.","Acquisition of Shared Equipment $45,000
 Buildout of teaching/training Lab $25,000
 Staff $15,000
 Furniture and Facility Renovations  $5,000
 Advertising & Outreach  $5,000
 Legal Costs  $5,000","Our vision for 2050 is a vibrant network of affordable, accessible biotech incubators across the LA region, where life science innovators from any background can access the facilities and equipment they need to move their ideas forward. 
 
 LabLaunch-Monrovia represents the prototypical example of the support we plan to build for the biotech innovators of Los Angeles. Following completion of LabLaunch-Monrovia, we plan to create another 4-5 similar facilities, serving areas across LA County to ensure that all life science entrepreneurs have an affordable and accessible place to start their business. In partnership with the cities and County of Los Angeles, as well as our private sector partners, we will identify suitable locations and create facilities tailored to the needs and existing assets of the local areas.
 
 Once businesses have found a place to start up and develop their technologies through a Lab Launch incubator, they will soon need both larger facilities to accommodate their continued growth, as well as funding to commercialize and scale their products. With our partners in the public and private sectors, we intend to create a network of innovation spaces that will serve growing biotech companies until they are successful enough to become stand-alone operations. Examples include scalable facilities where growing companies can rent individual research and development suites, as well as facilities to accommodate commercial business acceleration programs that can help move startups to the marketplace more efficiently. Additionally, we will partner with investors and venture capital to create dedicated biotech investment fund opportunities that will provide financial support to promising startups that use our facilities. 
 
 We believe that the path to a prosperous and thriving economy for the 21st Century is through supporting innovative new businesses that will create the technologies of tomorrow. By enabling these groundbreaking companies to start up, grow and thrive here, they will in turn create thousands of quality jobs across the region, supporting a thriving middle class for the Los Angeles area of 2050."

5102052,Leveraging The Children’s Movement to Make LA the Best Place to Learn,2018019,,,"Children Now will help make LA County the best place to learn by recruiting, connecting and building the advocacy capacity of a diverse range of LA groups, including parent, faith, business and community organizations. With tools and training from Children Now, these groups will collectively push for local and state policies designed to ensure that all of the estimated 793,811 kids ages 0-5 living in LA County have access to quality early childhood programs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Play,"The gap in services and supports for children birth-5 years is stunning. Some families have access to many high-quality services, while others have absolutely nothing. For example, a parent making minimum wage in California would need to spend 71% of her income on full-day infant care. By the time kids start kindergarten, there are already wide learning gaps that are extraordinarily difficult to close. With only 55% of Los Angeles third-grade students reading at grade level, bolder steps are needed to support our youngest learners. 
 The problem is urgent, and the Movement is a game changer. Public policy change is actually the most efficient and fastest way to scale innovative high-impact programs and secure the resources needed to improve early childhood outcomes for kids. Children Now created The Children’s Movement to connect a diverse range of organizations and provide the collective advocacy power needed to make kids and early learning the top investment and policy priority.
 Over the next year, LA County will become the best place to learn with the help of significant increases in proven early childhood programs, especially for low-income children, foster care kids and English language learners. This will be accomplished through these activities:
 - Identify and recruit 100 additional LA County groups to join the Children’s Movement; 
 - Spread awareness and create urgency about the need for more investments that increase quality early learning supports;
 - Provide tailored tools, such as fact sheets, talking points and sign-on letters that allow groups to successfully engage in local and state advocacy; 
 - Provide intensive, hands on advocacy training to all Movement members within targeted districts.
 As a result, at least 4 school districts in LA County addition to LAUSD will initiate or increase investments in proven early childhood programs, and the 2016-17 state budget will include increased investments in quality early childhood programs like quality child care, comprehensive home visitation and increased preschool support (with over a quarter of the state’s population, these state investments have a substantial impact on our County).
 Longer-term, Movement members will create a sustained, powerful force for local and state policy change that will help bridge the equity gap in the fragmented birth-5 system. This includes efforts aimed at creating equal access to programs working to close the opportunity gap for all kids, starting at birth.","Historically, school districts have not invested heavily, if at all, in early childhood programs. While Children Now’s advocacy ensured money in the new state education finance law could be used for early childhood, it still remains a struggle at the local level. The Movement strategy response is ensuring that diverse groups have the tools to push for local early childhood investments.
 
 Another major challenge is the fragmentation of the birth-5 field, complicating the essential “unified” ask. We address this risk through 1) our trusted relationships with First 5s, business, labor, provider, parent equity and other groups that need to be coordinated in a unified ask, and 2) our proven ability to position complex policy issues as “Pro-Kid.” All this was evidenced in our successful 2015 effort to unite the field in an unprecedented state policy ask advocating for early childhood investments.","Children Now will track metrics around 3 key areas as follows:
 
 Equity: At least 4 LA County school districts, in addition to LAUSD, will initiate policies or increase investments in proven early childhood models, with a focus on English language learners and kids in poverty and foster care. District budgets will be reviewed to verify these early investments and policies.
 
 Community engagement: The number of Movement members in LA County will be increased by at least 100. Membership growth and diversity will be tracked through online databases. 
 
 Scale and Leverage: Participation of LA County Movement members in local and state level advocacy campaigns that lead to increased support for quality birth-5 programs will increase by at least 35% (policies Movement members will influence include quality child care and preschool, home visiting and others). Groups that sign onto campaigns and attend trainings to influence school district and state Pro-Kid policies will be tracked.","There are thousands of organizations in Los Angeles County that care about kids, but none do what Children Now does. In local and state advocacy, the cacophony of voices can overwhelm or confuse policymakers. Connecting and coordinating partners is the core of the Children’s Movement – we bring diverse groups together under the simple “Pro-Kid” umbrella, allowing each group to share credit for policy wins. Our 285+ cohort of current Los Angeles County members demonstrate the Movement’s breadth and diversity, and also indicates how powerful the Movement can be at scale. (See full Movement member list: http://ow.ly/Rm47z). 
 
 We are able to coordinate this vast, diverse Movement because Children Now is California’s only umbrella kid’s organization (akin to the Chamber of Commerce being an umbrella business organization). We excel at research, policy, communications, network-building and advocacy, taking a “whole child” approach and covering the full range of issues critical to child development, including early childhood, education reform, health and child welfare. We bring together opinion leaders, policymakers and community groups to find common ground and drive innovative “win-win” local and state policies that help all children thrive. 
 
 Children Now studied successful interest groups like the AARP and Chamber of Commerce to develop a proof of concept that includes: 1) a clear vision for advancing public policy for kids, 2) deep policy expertise in a broad range of topics related to children, 3) simple, unifying messaging and 4) a strong grassroots membership to create pressure needed to move kids’ issues. 
 
 The Movement soft-launched in 2011 and was successfully tested in major campaigns, including passing California’s historic school finance law in 2013 (prioritizing resources for 3.5 million kids living in poverty, 1.3 million English language learners, and 43,000 foster youth) and in 2015 unifying 350+ organizations to successfully advocate for over $300 million in investments to improve quality and access to child care and preschool for over 16,000 children statewide. There have also been local policy wins, including some school districts investing in quality early learning supports. Additionally, communities that have integrated The Children’s Movement into their advocacy work have reported they are more effective and better connected to allies in the capital and across the state.","Stakeholder involvement, support and coordination is at the core of the Children Now model. We currently partner with over 1500 groups across the state, including hundreds in Los Angeles County. This collaboration includes engaging groups that are rarely invited to be part of the conversation – such as individual businesses and faith-based congregations. 
 
 Our LA County outreach team will provide easy-to-use tools to local organizations to effectively engage and lift up a range of diverse voices – including those of parents and caregivers - to advocate for quality early childhood programs. The Movement will leverage these collective voices to scale proven efforts – created by local partners in the public, non-profit and private sectors that support early child development and literacy at the state and local levels. 
 
 While we won’t be directly sub-granting to partners, our project team has a wealth of community organizing and advocacy experience that will serve as in-kind support to hundreds of groups. Our Los Angeles office includes Sharyn Church, former deputy director of LA’s Inner-City Arts, and Fatima Morales, former policy liaison to community-based groups. The team also includes Jim Keddy, former state director of PICO California (the faith based community organizing network), Kendra Rogers, former Executive Director of First 5 Fresno, and Eduardo Aguilar, former district administrator and community organizer. Our on the ground staff will train local groups for local and state advocacy and build their confidence to participate in policy campaigns. This coordinated collection of diverse groups will effectively engage in state and local advocacy activities to support quality early childhood programs and help make LA the best place to learn.","We estimate this project will cost $250,000 and have secured $150,000 to support our work to expand early childhood programs in Los Angeles.","Personnel and benefits- $79,985

 No issue has more community and bipartisan support than kids’ wellbeing. But in our interest-group-driven politics, children lose out to more strategic, coordinated and consolidated efforts. The Children’s Movement addresses this by taking kids’ groups out of their silos and leveraging their collective power. The Movement is making kids the #1 policy priority by empowering hundreds of parent, business and community groups to speak with one voice.
 
 During the first year, Children Now will highlight early childhood and secure tangible wins in at least 4 school districts (and LAUSD) and the state budget by scaling The Children’s Movement model in Los Angeles County. This will be done by:
 
 - Employing the organization’s research, policy, and advocacy expertise;
 - Leveraging trusted relationships with local and state policymakers to reach the right decision makers;
 - Using our unique position as the only whole-child/umbrella children’s organization to bring hundreds of stakeholders on board;
 - Developing simple, effective Pro-Kid messaging; 
 - Communicates with Movement members daily via digital media, and engages local groups one on one to participate in local and state policy campaigns; and
 - Mobilizing the network at the right times. 
 
 The coordinated, diverse Pro-Kid advocacy base strengthened as a result of this grant will enable communities to keep working on future critical issues affecting the County’s kids. By unifying hundreds of Pro-Kid groups and serving as hub to mobilize their actions, the Movement gives children’s issues an advocacy base strong enough to compete with powerful special interests. Moving forward, kids’ issues will truly be the top priority of state and local policymakers (not just lip service), and there will be an army of engaged, coordinated organizations ready when critical policy issues arise. After the funding period, Children Now will continue to expand the Movement model throughout LA County and California."

5102177,LIFT-LA Member2Member Project,2018068,,,"LIFT-LA’s model is predicated on the belief that poverty is complicated, getting help should not be-- more connected families are more likely to manage crises and move out of poverty. We will augment our current model by sharpening our focus to work with parents with young children to truly break the cycle of poverty. We will build the formal and informal supports necessary to get resources directly into their hands.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Tenant partner of the Magnolia Community Initiative,Create,"In building a dual generation approach to poverty alleviation, LIFT-LA will build on its model to connect parents with children to the resources needed to address short term financial crisis. We recognize that stability is about more than income. At LIFT, they are connected with a volunteer advocate who provides sustained support helping community members navigate a host of resources from public benefits enrollment to eviction prevention. Building trusting relationships and partnering to achieve goals, like better employment and education, are foundational elements that impact children’s long-term outcomes. Patty came to us homeless, living in her car with her son. In one month, they found a home that they love plus health care, job training, and transportation assistance for her son to get to school. Since 2013, LIFT-LA has created positive outcomes almost 3,000 families like Patty’s- in 2014 we put over a half million dollars back into the pockets of the members we serve and has established itself as a model for more effective and human-centered service. 
 
 In Our Kids, Putnam asserts that strong community bonds and social networks results in increased health, happiness, economic success, and child welfare. We all count on others to get ahead often utilizing the 3 f’s—family, friends, and Facebook. Like financial capital, social capital (including that afforded by social media) is distributed unevenly with higher income families having a more robust network than poorer families. Member2Member delivers goods and services from those who are well-connected and wanting to be of help to those who are socially isolated with a myriad of barriers to access support. We know that a $3,000 increase in parents’ income during a child’s early years is associated with a 17 percent increase in the child’s future earnings. A 2006 trial in Vietnam gave one-off handouts to 550 households; two years later, local poverty rates had fallen by 20 percentage points. We also know that intervening early to support the development of a high-quality relationship between parent and child mitigates the negative impact of toxic stress, a risk factor for lifelong health and social problems. Imagine the returns if we invested in this type of resource exchange. How might we fundamentally alter the trajectory of children’s lives? Our hope is that we can create a brighter and richer childhood for the next generation and, in doing so, make LA a healthier place to live.","Our focus on parents presents us the opportunity to optimize limited time and resources to make the greatest impact. However, we will need to reshape our model to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. New considerations will include: How should we differently design our physical space (childcare space, lactation rooms)? Which partners best support parents? What outcomes will we need to track parental AND child-level progress? We have embarked in a process that will allow us to define, hypothesize, design, and test key levers that will be the most impactful. A specific activation includes cash/resource transfers, our Member2Member program. In order to make this successful, we need to build the ideal platform for the transaction and develop rules for selecting and engaging members. We have developed a minimally viable product- a low tech outreach to well-resourced stakeholders and their networks- to apply our design process detailed above.","LIFT measures Member progress in two ways:
 
 1. We track financial progress (employment, housing) in our online case management system, Link.
 
 2. Second, we utilize Constituent Voice (CV), a system that utilizes micro-surveys to capture participant feedback about service quality and personal and social foundations after each Member meeting. Similar to the way that for-profit organizations use consumer feedback to improve product quality and service, CV enables LIFT to solicit feedback on its services from our members' rating.
 
 LIFT was one of the first non-profits in the country to implement CV. Our data shows that individuals that score high on the personal and social factors are twice as likely to sustain progress on their financial goals. We have also learned that social connectedness may be the most predictive indicator of economic success. Using this information, we implement program refinements that, through CV, our members are telling us make a difference in their lives.","After a site visit, a Program Officer from the Ahmanson Foundation stated “I have been with the foundation for 26 years and I thought I saw everything LA has to offer, but today you showed me that I haven’t.” LIFT-LA capitalizes on the strength of existing community resources by creating reciprocal partnerships with strong social service organizations. We are well-positioned to partner with a wide variety of organizations that may do one, but not all of the aspects of what we are able to do. Reputable organizations providing strong services are excited to partner with LIFT-LA knowing that their model does not replicate nor duplicate, but rather adds to the capacity to perform great work in a world of limited funding and lean staff. That said, Imagine LA’s model also works with volunteers to help families out of poverty. We have found that with technology, and a different subset of volunteers, we have been able to reach much greater volume (less than 100/year vs. over 900/year) with much less cost. We also seeking to learn from other organizations that have developed direct resource exchange such as Benevolent, Chrysalis, and the Family Independence Initiative, but again, feel that there are aspects of our model—scale, the import on relationship, the type of resource being exchanged—that differentiate our work and will add to a growing base of knowledge around disruptive solutions to poverty alleviation. In addition, while constituent voice well-established among nonprofits in the developing world, LIFT is leading the way for this work in the U.S. as one of the first American social service providers to incorporate CV into its evaluation framework.","LIFT works with a variety of partners – housing programs, youth organizations, health clinics – to ensure clients are able to access resources. LIFT receives thousands of referrals from its partners, who lean on LIFT to provide complementary support to their case managers who cannot provide personalized services due to strict eligibility and scarce resources. LIFT builds the capacity of its partners, changing the landscape of the social service system and encouraging more organizations to work together to fight poverty. Accordingly, we are a select member of LA:Rise administered by REDF and the City of LA’s Department of Economic and Workforce Development to provide support services to families enrolled in social enterprises like Chrysalis, Homeboy Industries, and others. As we shift to a two-generation frame, we will continue to grow our partners strategically, focusing on organizations that deliver child-centered outcomes.The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MCI) unites 75+ organizations to create scalable community improvement. As many of the organizations in the MCI are focused on supporting children, LIFT fills the gap in helping parents to support their family unit. LIFT-LA is truly the partner that MCI has been waiting for- the connective tissue mobilizing the network, and ensruing that community members understand, access, and utilize the resources available. UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities will be working with LIFT-LA to codify its goal planning process to develop road maps for families to bring about increased outcomes in health, education, economic stability, and parental bonding. As part of the Member2Member program, we have developed relationships with SoLA rentals to prioritize apartments for LIFT-LA families to be matched with a $2,000 fund for each family to use to reach stability. We are also working with an investor to develop a JFLA LIFT fund to provide funds for members who earn enough to pay the rent but not the security deposit in a move into a safe and affordable home. LIFT-LA benefits from nationwide participation in organizations working to tackle the cycle of poverty, including:
 • The Aspen Ascend Network working to address two-generation poverty
 • The Fund for Shared Insight using the voice of participants as an evaluative measure
 • America Forward: social entrepreneurs and policymakers influencing national change

 3. Pilot: We will conduct rapid iteration pilots. We will also make key organizational investments in human capital and infrastructure to support roll-out in summer 2016.","LIFT is focused on changing the systems that stifle social mobility for millions of vulnerable families. 
 At the heart of this work is perception change – in order to create a social service system that successfully supports families’ progress, those who are designing the system must fundamentally understand what the poor need, and that it is no different than the supports the middle and upper classes need to thrive. LIFT is currently developing an influence strategy to share its results and stories with key influencers, leveraging our position to shift perceptions and drive meaningful change for families in the social service system. 
 
 As we learn from our work with families, we hope to refine our message and approach to more specifically drive shifts that will create a more enabling environment for parents and their children to achieve mobility. Examples of this could be partnering with a technology company to bring aspects of our model to scale for millions of low-income Angelinos. The support from LA2050 will help us build the foundation upon which we can create a broader platform to amplify our insights and impact for low-income families. 
 
 LIFT engages its cohort of advocates (mainly college students) in direct service every year. Simultaneously, the LIFT experience also pushes our advocates to grapple with the US’s most challenging issues related to poverty, race, inequality, and policy. Many of our advocates are transformed by the LIFT experience and continue to dedicate themselves to fighting poverty, whether through their chosen career, serving on nonprofit boards, or advocating in their communities. 
 
 We recognize that by delivering excellent outcomes, we can become an influential demonstration model that speaks to what works. From this platform we can persuade leaders across the philanthropic, for-profit, nonprofit, and government sectors to adapt best practices that can interrupt the cycle of poverty at scale and create a brighter future for the next generation of children."
5102025,Linked Learning: College Work & Life Ready Through BBBSLAs Workplace Mentoring Program,2018007,,,"In a world that is becoming increasingly automated & online, one of the most radical & innovative things you can do is to return to the basics to unleash the potential in real human to human interaction. Most people can identify an adult from their childhood who served as their guide and ""showed us the ropes"" - a mentor. BBBSLA wants to connect our city's vulnerable youth to qualified mentors through our programs, which have been proven to measurably improve learning and academic outcomes.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"In 2014, BBBSLA achieved a 96% high school graduation rate and 94% of graduates are college bound in a cohort that is 100% youth of color from some of LA's most under-resourced regions. We know that nothing can serve as a substitute for the transformative impact of one-to-one mentoring in the life of a young Angeleno whose potential can be activated by a caring mentor.
 
 Ensuring the continued success of our youth depends increasingly on the availability of ""linked learning"" opportunities, which is education that encourages academic success while introducing work-based learning to help youth envision a school-to-career pipeline. BBBSLA's Workplace Mentoring Program links high school juniors and seniors to mentors in some of LA's most influential corporations. Students are transported from their high school's to their Workplace Program Sites to participate in a two hour session that begins with a facilitated session led by our BBBSLA team focused on college and career readiness, as well as life skills learning, and concludes with one-to-one time with their mentors. The program is more than a ""career exploration day"" as it spans an entire school year. 
 
 BBBSLA's Workplace Mentoring Program transforms our city into a ""learning lab"" for youth curated by professionals who want to help our young Angelenos see their own potential as well as the potential in our city. In this way, learning happens while helping Angelenos connect more deeply to each other and to where we work and live.","BBBSLA is committed to ensuring that all youth have the opportunity to reach their full potential in life through mentoring, yet as our culture continues to move toward more digital and online administered learning and content, it can sometimes be difficult to make a case for the value of one-to-one, in-person mentoring. Despite this challenge, the results speak for themselves: for the past 4 years, BBBSLA has achieved a 95% high school graduation rate. This year, knowing that 94% of our graduates are college bound has revitalized our resolve and belief that mentoring is a proven strategy for achieving positive learning outcomes. 
 
 However, we know we can't do this alone. Partnerships are key in connecting our youth to the linked learning and mentoring opportunities that result in such dramatically positive and inspiring outcomes. BBBSLA will utilize the LA2050 Challenge to expand the ability for more youth to participate in our Workplace Programs with firms in key, high growth sectors","As the only national youth mentoring program with evidence-based outcomes, Big Brothers Big Sisters measures the impact for the majority of the Little Brothers and Little Sisters we serve through our Youth Outcomes Survey (YOS). Careful analysis of the survey results allows the agency to be accountable for each youth we serve and nurture their success. During the length of a match, our case management team utilizes the Strength of Relationship (SOR) survey to evaluate the development of the relationship between the Big and Little.
 
 Additionally, BBBSLA is currently tracking high school graduation rates and college admissions rates, which are broken down to detailed demographic information, including by each Service Planning Area (SPA) in Los Angeles County. This data allows us to see where we are having the most impact. In 2014, the largest share of our college bound students came from South Los Angeles and South Bay regions (SPA 6 & 8).","While there are numerous mentoring organizations, BBBSLA has served Los Angeles County since 1955 through our unique, professionally-supported mentoring programs and we continue to serve 1,500 youth and families annually - that's 1,500 young Angeleno's being connected to 1,500 caring, adult volunteers who are serving as their mentors. For 60 years, BBBSLA has continued to evolve our programs through innovative, forward-thinking strategies, such as our Workplace Mentoring Program, while maintaining our adherence to our time-honored one-to-one, in-person mentoring model, which has proven to be effective in not only helping youth achieve positive learning outcomes, but also support their psychosocial development in ways that measurably increase their self-confidence, educational aspirations, and their ability to achieve their goals of higher education or obtaining gainful employment. 
 
 We are currently working with CBS, Sony Pictures Entertainment, NFL Network, Union Bank, and Price Waterhouse Coopers, whose employees have experienced the impact this program has in the lives of youth and on their workplace as a way to tangibly see the power of partnerships, mentoring, and corporate social responsibility.","Our goal is to establish two new Workplace Mentoring Program sites, which cost $25,000 per site to open and operate for an academic year to serve up to 30 youth and 30 adult volunteers per site. The partners will not directly receive funds, rather that funds will be used to operate our Workplace Mentoring Programs at their facilities.","Our goal is to open two new Workplace Mentoring Sites, which will cost $25,000 per site that together will serve up to 60 new Workplace Mentoring matches. The remaining $50,000 will be used to provide the following services:
 1. College advising workshops & college campus visits for the Workplace Mentoring Program for up to 150 students.
 2. Case management support for the duration of their participation in the program, which is most often two years until they graduate high school and through college matriculation.
 3. Partnership cultivation to reach out to schools in LA's under-resourced regions to identify youth to participate in the program.
 
 Additional costs will be covered through corporate and foundation grants.","$25,000 (1 of 2) New Workplace Mentoring Program Sites*

 $15,000 (3) College Advising Workshops for up to 200 youth
 $5,000 College campus visits for up to 200 youth (Logistics, supervision, transportation)
 
 *Includes on-site staff support; facilitation of on-site sessions; transportation of youth to and from work site, and supplies.","For 60 years, BBBSLA has been growing our reach in Los Angeles and our goal is to increase the number of Workplace Mentoring Program sites throughout Los Angeles in key, high-growth sectors over the next decade. While we currently have 5 Workplace Mentoring Program sites, a LA2015 grant will help us grow to 7 and in following years, we hope to continue adding to the number of program sites so that eventually, we will have every major LA-based company and industry represented. The goal of our LA2050 submission is to kickstart our growth so we can continue to scale the impact of our program to help make this unique, proven effective linked learning program to more of LA's youth."
5102204,Linking Middle High School & College Students through Humanity Centered Media,2015135,,,"The goal is to follow the progress of our teens throughout high school, into college, and into their careers, providing middle and high school students with college role models, and providing college students with internship opportunities and professional skill development. 
 
 Our proposal is to launch a 9-month Common Core aligned media education curriculum with local schools, giving their students an opportunity to work with our university media students to produce PSAs, short films, commercial",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A
5102023,LitRemix,2015015,,,"The world looks toward Los Angeles as the mecca of creativity and imagination, making it the perfect anchor city to pilot LitRemix. We are proposing a partnership to engage both HS and college students in a program that generates art inspired by specific classic books taught in school. Common-core compliant, LitRemix is based on 10 years of work through Artists for Literacy. It directly addresses the challenge teachers have to make the experience of reading books relevant to their students.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,,Learn,"LitRemix will energize the experience of studying literature in Los Angeles, with a unique tool that helps students delve more deeply into books they are required to read, through a genuine process where reading and writing are intertwined significantly and are expressed uniquely through visual art and songs. These resulting artifacts will be used to connect peers through the LitRemix network, where they may find new motivation to further explore the importance of reading and literature in today’s world. 
 
 • INCLUSIVITY: Thanks to the diversity and universality of art, all Angelinos can find a connection to books through LitRemix. The platform is designed to DEMOCRATIZE the user experience as much as possible - enabling a wide cross-section of students to engage, interact and learn - no matter how limited their access is to technology. LitRemix will be accessed through phones, tablets and desktops. Users will listen to songs, view art and watch videos - all inspired by the books that are active in the network. This will be the first interactive database of art inspired by literature, to be enjoyed not only by students, but also by the millions of literature buffs who LOVE this conversation about books and the art they inspire.
 
 • EVENTS: Our vision for LA as the pilot city includes producing a series of LitRemix Events, to be held in neighborhood libraries all across the city, bringing much needed traffic to these under-appreciated community spaces. These concerts, film debuts and art shows will celebrate specific books, the art they inspire, and the young artists responsible for the creation of this new art. These unique events will set an example for other cities that eventually choose to integrate LitRemix into their education system. Los Angeles will lead the way.
 
 • DIVERSITY: With its interactive, collaborative and modular nature, LitRemix holds the promise to become an essential tool for parents and educators in LA. It welcomes all users, regardless of their place of residence, nationality, religion, ideology, culture, education, gender and age. LitRemix is for those who struggle with reading and for those who are thriving readers looking for even more inspiration after they’ve read a book. Our site is completely bi-lingual – in English and Spanish. It reflects the diversity of LA, and we hope the art it generates from Angelinos will be as powerful as the books that inspire its existence.","LitRemix – the app - will initially only be coded for IOS phones and tablets. The DESKTOP version will be the most widely accessible portal. Therefore, we are going to ensure that students, parents, teachers and professors first engage with LitRemix.com before they decide engage with their mobile devices. We are going to create a strategy to ensure a seamless experience that works for different contexts – regardless of the device.
 
 For the pilot program, we will feature existing art inspired by Homer’s Odyssey. We chose this book because it taught in both HS and College. Our challenge will be not in the EXPLORATION of existing art we have curated – but in the SHARING of the students-created music, visual art and videos. Teachers must first vet the initial works of art, before they are uploaded to our galleries. We realize the importance of this step, to ensure good quality artifacts that later are matched with lesson plans. Again, we are going to work on a clear strategy for this.","In the last 10 years, teachers have reported back to Artists for Literacy informally, when they have used our Songs Inspired by Literature CDs in their classrooms. From this experience, we have watched how teachers (and parents) have seen an increase in interest, engagement and comprehension of the specific books our songs connect with. This history has formed the foundation of how we can begin to measure our impact in ELA, ESL, and other learning environments.
 
 For the Los Angeles Pilot, would like to use 4 High Schools and 2 Local colleges. We will evaluate the impact of the LitRemix Platform by studying: 
 • student engagement numbers (metric from app itself) 
 • student testimonials
 • teacher testimonials
 • quality of art created
 • frequency of sharing
 • online conversations
 • lesson plan downloads
 • attendance at LitRemix events
 • interest in seeing other books added to the network
 • community reaction – including media interest, literary community, parents","There are no direct competitors to LitRemix. There are several organizations who have embraced art and literature together. They do not specifically make the connection between books and the art they inspire, nor do they facilitate the creation and sharing of art about specific books taught in school For example:
 
 • The BIG READ, funded by the NEA is a strong example of how cities like LA are committed to taking the excitement and power of great books into a larger community forum. This program celebrates one book a year and hosts events to engage a diversity of supporters and participants. 
 
 • Organizations like 826 Valencia, Beyond Baroque Literary Arts, GetLit, PEN USA, and WriteGirl all celebrate the fusion of reading and writing here in LA and even across the country.
 
 • There are apps available that connect people together through the act of reading (LightSail, Subtext, LiquidTex). These do not leverage the strengths of students who express and learn differently – through sound, art and movement – instead of verbal or written book reports.
 
 What’s so striking about the power of art inspired by literature is how rich the resources truly are – but how DISPARATE they are. No one entity has yet to AGGREGATE the best movies, visual art and music inspired by specific books. Ironically, services like Amazon sell all these types of media but never offer a bundle to help inspire and educate people. That is not their core business – to cross reference – as logical as it might seem.
 
 LitRemix is extremely unique. What if all the art that one book inspires was aggregated for immediate access through a single source? It would be one of the richest resources on earth, where anyone could mine for stories, told through all modes of artistic expression - written, aural, visual, mixed-media.
 
 We're building LitRemix to ensure that a platform exists to introduce and celebrate literature through the art it inspires. It will sit at the nexus of rich media, mobile, and social growth, and will drive instant engagement and collaboration. While being a cultural phenomena in its own right, LitRemix will also help both striving and struggling readers engage meaningfully with literature - by meeting them on their 21st century map of the world. LitRemix will expand the traditionally isolating experience of reading into a realm of discovery, sharing, and creating.","We are actively engaging students, teachers and parents to help inform every step of our development and pilot process. Specifically, we have a student from Santa Monica College (a graduate of Santa Monica High) who has been given some equity ownership in LitRemix. He is also the technology lead on the app development. Our lead designer is a student who lives in Spain (also an equity partner) and brings the bilingual element to our project. She has a degree in both design and education. 
 
 We are also in early conversations with teachers from Mozilla’s Hive network. They are just about to start a chapter in Los Angeles. Alexander Fishman is one of our advisors and has been tapped to lead the Hive. Hives are comprised of organizations (libraries, museums, schools and non-profit startups) and individuals (educators, designers, community catalysts and makers). Together, they create opportunities for youth to learn within and beyond the confines of traditional classroom experiences, design innovative practices and tools that build the field for greater impact, and contribute to their own professional development within an active community of practice. 
 
 Because of our 10 + years with Artists for Literacy, we also have collaborators in the library system. We will be reaching out to branch libraries all across the city, to ensure that they have the chance to participate with the first launch of the LitRemix – Odyssey version. We’ll be holding events at their locations, to increase traffic to their campuses and spread the word about our learning platform.
 
 Our use of the 100k will not be going directly to these collaborators. We will be discussing the use of the 100k in the next section.","Looking at this one year grant period – which is what this proposal covers - LitRemix will use every cent of the 100k to launch a pilot project. We will need more money to bring on additional staff and expand our program to serve more members. Since we are already in the development stage without any funding – just sweat and labor of love hours – we plan to end this cycle of martyrdom and create a healthy working paradigm for all involved. 
 
 We have targeted several potential partners in the venture world who we would like to approach for long-term investment into LitRemix. We believe that a grant from “LA2050” will not only help us complete our platform and launch our pilot program – it will also enable us make valuable 1st degree connections to Ed tech investors. With this networking in place, we are very confident that we will find the money and support we need to grow for years to come.
 
 LitRemix has a business model that includes a healthy revenue stream, by offering premium memberships to the network. Our 5-year budget projects profitability by the 2nd year of operation. Our hope is that we will be able to test out this model with experts in the field of business, education and technology – before we commit to any large expenditure. Again, the LA2050 win would up the game for us. The network behind this competition most certainly has members who will become valuable stakeholders in our project.","We’ll use 65k to complete the beta version of our LitRemix Digital Platform. That translates to one underpaid, kind-hearted engineer and several beta testers. We’ll use 35K to secure 2 staff members to plan, execute, and monitor pilot programs for 4 LAUSD High Schools and 2 college-age, LA-based English 101 participants. Platform completion in Winter/Spring 2016 will run simultaneously with our outreach program to secure participating teachers and schools (we are looking at the Incubator School, Green Dot, and schools in Inglewood and West LA). We plan to launch the pilot program Fall 2016. We'll also be securing new financial support during this one-year period, so that we can expand into other schools in Spring 2017.","Specific to our strategy and tactical plans for expansion, LitRemix will grow and scale based on how we plot out our expansion city-by-city. As stated earlier, our pilot schools – both HS and College will be our focus for the first 4-month pilot. With the feedback from these groups, we will take on more territories within LA and more sister-cities. We’ll expand out to Baldwin Hills, Culver City, Silver Lake, and the Valley. We also have teachers in San Francisco, Kansas, Arkansas, Florida and Chicago standing by. 
 
 Students in Venice High School reading “The Odyssey” might be given the chance to collaborate on a music video with students who live in Detroit. Also, a teacher in Florida sharing a teaching tip on how to include of particular work of art about The Odyssey into a lesson-flow, might be considering art created by a student from Westchester. This not only scales the variety of art – but expands the network’s ability to show differing perspectives – diversity of thought. Because our site is bi-lingual for Spanish speakers, we also hope to be expanding into Spanish-speaking populations within Los Angeles and sister cities. 
 
 The expansion of LitRemix is critical to its impact on each learner who participates in the network. The more books we integrate – with more calls for submissions for the art they inspire – the more powerful the LitRemix experience will be. Equally important are the increasing members of teachers who can contribute to the pedagogical direction of the platform. Teaching tips and lesson plans will be crowd-sourced, with partnerships with organizations like Graphite.org – a Common Sense Media community. We believe that as LitRemix scales and expands, student buzz and engagement around reading books will take on a new, enthusiastic vibe.
 
 While we scale our product over time, we will also focus on keeping it accessible to all students. Access to browse the platform will always be free. To fully participate, create a profile, exchange creative files – these activities will require log-in, which comes with premium access. This keeps the network safe, and enables us to curate the art as it comes in. Premium access to the network will be granted at the individual, group and district-wide levels, with associated fees subject to each context.
 
 The LitRemix vision is a fantastic mash-up of music, videos, and visual art from all over the world –celebrating some of the greatest works of both classic and modern literature."
5102068,Live Well Pico Union,2015039,,,Clinica Romero is a community health clinic dedicated to improve the health and lives of patients and community at large that proposes a holistic approach to healthier lifestyles.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Clinica Romero Pico Union Clinic Site,0CreatePlay0,"Clinica Romero's Healthy Pico Union project would aim to provide comprehensive services including medical, mental health, health education, nutrition, and exercise classes to underserved individuals living in the Pico Union neighborhood of Los Angeles as a means of combating chronic health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. 
 
 Currently, individuals who access services at our clinic have the ability to see a medical provider and enroll themselves in a healthy living counseling group that focuses on the connection between physical and emotional health. Participants in the group learn how emotional issues and pain can negatively impact physical health, such as depression decreasing energy levels, motivation and disrupting sleep. We also look at how often individuals engage in unhealthy physical practices trying to treat emotional pain, such as overeating or eating unhealthy foods that provide short-term comfort. Another example might be subconsciously gaining and maintaining obesity as a way of hiding from relationships due to past trauma. The group will learn and practice healthy eating, exercise, and the accountability and motivation we can get from healthy relationships.
 
 Unfortunately for our group participants, the Pico Union area lacks safe, green space where individuals and their families can regularly work out in order to stay healthy. An additional barrier that prevents local families from regularly exercising is exposure to violence due to gang activity at local parks during evening hours (when families are most likely to have the time to engage in these activities). 
 
 Through bringing exercise equipment to our Pico Union clinic site located at 123 S. Alvarado St., we will provide a space where families can safely engage in healthy practices that will improve their overall health. We plan to purchase outdoor exercise equipment that will withstand various weather conditions. Families will be able to access equipment during our regular hours that include extended evening hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.","Challenges with this project would be to have people consistently use the equipment and develop a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their families. Overcoming this will take a designated community health advocate to ensure patients and communities participate in the healthy living program. The community health advocate will identify community and patients, be their motivator during designated times, and follow up on progress and interest levels.","Clinica Romero will 
 
 -Install a minimum of 5 outdoor exercise stations 
 -Provide nutrition classes to the local community
 -Engage in counseling to find the root causes of chronic obesity and diabetes
 -Publicize availability of workshops and exercise space 
 -Maintain social media presence.",No.,"Each of these partners would assist in referring community members to our healthy living program:

Our approach is through collaboration to connect, engage & interact with LA service providers. Some goals… high school students will graduate on time, be college and/or career prepared and receive social and emotional support for higher self-esteem.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,"USC Neighborhood, LA County Probation Camps,",ALL,"LA, Inc. is reputed in the foster care industry for utilizing technology through innovative ways to increase civic engagement while serving other populations alongside. We build alliances with multiple digital and physical platforms to voice opinions, share ideas, leverage services & resources, influence elected officials, and contract with local government. 
 
 Over the 20 years of service we have connected to various organizations that allows us to recruit high volumes of volunteers, receive monetary contracts and make strong partnerships, that include USC, LA Unified School District, Department Children and Family Services, County of Los Angeles Probation Department, Worksource Centers, Verizon & So Cal Gas, just to name a few. We are proud to have a sponsored CA Assembly Bill #1148 unanimously passed mandating that foster youth aging out of the system have their vital life documents. i.e. social security cards, birth certificates and a photo I.D. By LA being the largest foster care population in the country, this will be an iterative process that will be responsive and transparent in providing these services to other populations, as we are meeting the demands for our foster youth. 
 
 LA, Inc. has designed intellectual property technology platform that electronically maintains vital life documents, amongst other features such as various data collection and information management processes. The purpose is to allow disenfranchised populations access to their documents to show proof of their identity which allows service consistency and to connect to multiple services, such as, transportation, housing, medical, education, employment, voting, attend events, but not limited to. This increases civic engagement, social connectedness which meets our services goals of educational attainment, employment preparedness and self-efficacy. By allowing foster youth to connect to services, we re-connect them as self-sufficient and contributing LA citizens.","Bureaucracy!!! We have been overcoming bureaucracy by continuing to build our relationships with public agencies that have guardianship & juridical rights over our youth population. We are making our relationships stronger and stronger as we go through different service contracts and they understand our vision and come to realize our approach is extremely effective. We work together by adding support to public agencies such LAUSD & DFCS. Our tactic is not to criticize or go against them; but to bring solutions, blood, sweat and tears to the table – ADVOCACY! For example LA DFCS system has a huge under taking in being able to manage and keep approx. 40,000 people of all races, ages and backgrounds alive at one time. People always say “the system is broken,” well the system is tough. This transcends to diverse disenfranchised populations that have to go through the same systems. It is just a matter of connecting our efforts, continually telling our story and building capacity!!!","LA, Inc. has participated in several different evaluation processes due to the array of funding streams. We can adapt to what will work best with LA2050. Our main comprehensive evaluation process was implemented and is conducted with our partnership with USC. It consist of: 1.) Logic Model Development to identify the goals, activities, services, and desired results; and 2.) Goals Based Evaluation Plan to focus on short term goals to track progress towards meeting long term goals during the project year (formative). The required methods of data collection and assessment will be incorporated with LA2050 target metrics and operating procedures that will be carried out on a daily, weekly, and/or monthly basis to support effective project management and decision making. Thus, the project's comprehensive evaluation plan will consist of appropriate and specific quantitative/qualitative measures that can be modified as needed.","As far as competition, there are no other organizations actually gathering and maintaining documents for foster youth to be able to access their own personal identifiable information. A feasibility report was conducted by USC for LA, Inc. that indicated there are limited resources that deal with vital life documents. Primarily, a demand and market for obtaining and securing this information does exist. However, over the years various for profit companies have charged individuals to obtain vital life documents however, they do not maintain vital life documents for people. 
 
 We are proud to say over the last 4 years of introducing our technology platform, to the HUGE bureaucracy of agencies, we have numerous awards, letters of support & certificates of recognitions. Even our national advocate for foster youth, Congresswoman Bass has endorsed the need for our program.","The current partners we have are actually contributing to the services of meeting the goals of the program. The collaboration with the LAUSD program for tutoring services, the cost to my partner is included in the contract. LA, Inc. is a direct service provider, meaning that the $100,000.00 goes to the youth we serve for their monthly metro cards, food, electronic communication, monthly life skills workshops, special events, computers, cell phones and case management for assessments and referrals to additional services that they need or aspire. We are known as the mother of our foster youth. Since the inception of our organization, 1996 we still have former foster youth that come to us for different services. We have been the one single continuous connection they have had since being in the foster care system. The budget below will show the additional expenses that keep our foster youth and former foster youth engaged, out of trouble and motivated.","Using a collaborative approach we have several streams of funding to meet the matching requirements. Our strong partnership with USC allows us to leverage countless resources, services and monetary support from different departments. We will also introduce this opportunity to previous LA, Inc. unrestricted funders such as Weingart Foundation, California Community Foundation, Boeing Foundation, CarMax Foundation, Southern CA Gas, and Verizon Foundation. The issue with our prior unrestricted funders is that they base how much they fund us from our last year’s budget amounts. After we re-organized from a brick and mortar service provider to a virtual provider our budget decreased tremendously. We do not receive enough money to implement our technology platform. All other funding’s are for educational and employment services. We are currently submitting a proposal to Annenberg Foundation and will include the LA2050 opportunity. Also, we are finalizing another contract with LAUSD. We can negotiate with them on how to leverage LA2050 requirements with the population we are servicing.","Please note that this is a percentage of the cost to build capacity to reach 1,000 foster youth. Of course depending on the streams of funding percentages this will vary. We will pay wages directly for foster youth to help us on the LA2050 Campaign.

5102180,Local Roots Mobile Farmers Markets,2015117,,,"We will use a mobile trailer to encase a solar powered controlled environment farm to create a “Mobile Market” capable of growing and distributing high-quality local produce to residents of low-income neighborhoods Los Angeles. This Mobile Market will be the first in a fleet focused on educating the public about healthy eating, eradicating food deserts, combating obesity, and providing increased healthy food access in low-income neighborhoods.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"Local Roots’ Mission is to provide everyone access to fresh, healthy, and affordable locally-grown produce! We’ve spent the past two years designing and building cutting-edge vertical farms capable of growing produce 100x more efficiently than outdoor farms. In our LA-County headquarters, we grow top-quality produce 365 days per year using 90% less water than conventional farming and without ever using pesticides or herbicides.
  
 We believe access to sustainably-grown local produce should be universal, and we know that with the right technology and partnerships we can make it happen.
  
 So we want to take our farms out of the warehouse and onto the streets! We propose building our farms inside truck trailers designed to meet the unique needs of our Los Angeles communities. These Mobile Markets will make it possible to cultivate fresh produce right here in LA and deliver it directly to the low-income communities that need it the most.
  
 Each Mobile Market will be comprised of a 20’ solar-powered trailer capable of growing 500lbs of produce each week. This produce will be combined with produce donations from other local farmers and retailers to provide a consistent source of high-quality food into food deserts—areas without access to affordable, nutritious food that see higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Each day the Mobile Market will make regularly scheduled stops at low-income, food insecure communities and offer sustainably-grown local produce at affordable prices. The Mobile Market would accept all forms of payment including food assistance benefits.
  
 We envision our Mobile Markets becoming a focal point of the community, easily integrating where communities already gather such as recreational centers, schools, and/or existing markets.
  
 In addition, we see the Mobile Markets as an opportunity to provide educational resources on urban agriculture and sustainable vertical farming. Classroom visits from local schools would be welcome! And the Mobile Market would be a walk-in experience for all customers. We not only want to provide access to fresh produce, but also educate the public on how to prepare and cook delicious, healthy meals.
  
 By 2050, we believe sustainable vertical farms will be everywhere. Vacant lots will be transformed into living farms, abandoned buildings will be repurposed to create green-collar jobs in our communities, and our Mobile Market fleet will provide equal food access to all parts of the city!","We anticipate that zoning and permitting will be the most time intensive barrier to overcome – as a Mobile Market falls somewhere on the spectrum between a farm, a food truck, and a ‘visitors center.’ Our strategy to overcome this obstacle is first to partition the interior of the Mobile Market to clearly separate the ‘educational area’ (complete with videos on sustainable farming, a demonstrative crop and hydroponic system, etc.) from the ‘commercial farm’ portion. Second, we will work with the City of Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health, and California Department of Food & Agriculture to ensure we have their full support throughout the design and manufacturing process. Third, we will apply our current farm operating procedures to secure Good Agricultural Practice certifications and comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act. This will ensure our food safety is top-notch and we meet all regulatory standards for growing and distributing fresh produce.","Our primary metric for social impact will be measuring the number of pounds of produce distributed into food deserts throughout LA County. We will consider ourselves successful if we can distribute 20,000lbs of sustainable, locally-grown produce into LA food deserts during our first year of the Mobile Market program.
  
 Second, we will quantify the green collar jobs we create and the tax dollars we return to LA County. We believe each Mobile Market will create one full-time job, two part-time jobs and a host of volunteer opportunities. Our staff will engage in community garden and educational outreach projects to teach children the merits of sustainable farming techniques and encourage nutritious eating habits. We hope to track the career paths of any students we inspire to a future in farming.
  
 Finally, we will use surveys to measure changes in public sentiment around indoor farming, the advantages of eating local, and the importance of fruits and vegetables in our daily diet.","To our knowledge, there are no organizations in LA with a Mobile Market that distributes sustainably-grown local produce to low-income communities. We instead look to examples such as the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food & Agriculture in Washington DC as a self-sustaining mobile farmers market program focused on food access, education, and community engagement. As such, we know that similar models can be successful… and we won’t have any direct competition in LA.
  
 Our approach is novel in that our cutting-edge indoor farming technologies offer us a unique ability to place a farm on wheels and literally drive a farm into areas of LA that are not traditionally exposed to farms or an abundance of healthy foods. We enable consumers to connect directly with their food by seeing and experiencing sustainable agriculture first-hand. Further, the Mobile Markets eliminate all middlemen between ourselves and our consumers, enabling us to price our produce more affordably than retail stores and traditional farmers markets.
  
 We view our proposed Project as complementary to the many organizations in Los Angeles that share in our Mission and Vision.
  
 Ron Finley, the well-respected “Gangsta Gardener” of LA, has created an incredible community of urban gardeners and increased city-wide awareness about how underutilized land can be redeveloped to provide nourishment. We believe we can continue his work by further promoting the importance of urban agriculture.
  
 Farmscape helps design and build urban farm plots for LA County residents. They too do tremendous work growing and selling high quality fruits and vegetables hyper-locally, and we believe our Mobile Markets might be a great way to help them distribute their harvests.
  
 Food Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste, connecting this abundance with people in need, and inspiring others to do the same. They recover excess fruits and vegetables, donating 100% to local direct-service agencies who feed LA’s most vulnerable. We believe our Mobile Markets could help to distribute their collected produce directly into food deserts.
  
 Finally, we have incredible respect for Robert Egger and his Team at L.A. Kitchen. We believe that their mantra of decreasing food waste while increasing community health and employment aligns perfectly with our vision. We would like to aid his efforts in job creation, food collection, and distribution of quality food products in Greater Los Angeles.","We are portfolio members of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). The shared incubator space and access to resources has already helped us expand our core business by innovating new controlled environment agriculture technologies. We are excited to use the lab equipment and prototyping tools in the soon-to-open La Kretz Innovation Campus, as these new facilities will expedite our Mobile Market design and manufacturing process. Because we are already a LACI portfolio company, no part of the grant funds will be required by LACI to formalize their support.
  
 We believe the LA Food Policy Council (LAFPC) could be an incredible partner for us in this endeavor. The LAFPC has set objectives to create a thriving good food economy for everyone, strengthened agricultural and environmental stewardship throughout the region, and better health and wellbeing of residents. The Mobile Market concept hits on all three of these objectives, so we believe we can leverage our technology to realize their Vision. We anticipate acquiring their full support as we roll the program out – perhaps helping us connect with local restaurateurs and providing us with additional public relations exposure to get our message out. We do not believe any part of the grant funds will need to be provided to the LAFPC.
  
 We anticipate that clearing regulatory hurdles to accept Food Stamps and other food assistance programs may also be time intensive. It is our intention to partner with California Certified Farmers Markets and the California Department of Social Services to preemptively ensure we have the infrastructure necessary to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
  
 The other committed partners and collaborators on this Project are the same suppliers and manufacturers we use to build our current indoor farming facilities. All funds distributed to our manufacturers are outlined in the Project Budget below.","We have no doubts that we can economically grow, source and distribute affordable locally-grown produce through our Mobile Markets. We have already demonstrated the economics in our non-mobile farms and believe that the manufacturing, farming, and distribution expertise we have developed will carry over exactly.
  
 We believe that this Project will cost approximately $98,900 to implement. Please see below for a detailed Project Budget and explanation of costs. The nice part about this Project is that we have great flexibility in design and build-out of the Mobile Market. If we determine that we underestimated our design and construction costs, we have the ability to modify the farm build-out and supplement production with additional produce sourced from other local farmers, retailers, and philanthropic partners.
  
 This Mobile Market will be the first of many! So it is very important that we stay on budget and prove it can operate at breakeven.
 
 We believe that each Mobile Market will be economically self-sustaining after its initial construction and promotion. For this reason, costs of goods sold (such as input costs for growing produce and gas for driving the Mobile Market) have been omitted.","Based on our previous experience designing, building, and operating controlled-environment farms, we believe the following accurately represents the budget required to implement this project.

The purpose of this project will be to demonstrate economic feasibility, work out operational hiccups, and show that the program can be self-sustaining. Once we have a proven model for combating food deserts, we will approach the City of Los Angeles, foundations such as the Goldhirsh Foundation, and other Impact Investors for further capital investments required to grow a fleet. As the Mobile Markets develop a track record of positive, predictable cash flows and proven payback periods, we believe we can also access debt financing to further scale the Mobile Market fleet. We also anticipate future opportunities to help other entrepreneurs and/or foundations leverage our farming technologies to replicate the model more quickly than we ourselves can scale."

 Our location-centric based approach ensures the users only receive information that’s relevant to them. This is our competitive advantage. Our app will build upon previous innovations throughout our city to make LA the best place to connect!
 
 The app leverages the latest technology and advances, including:
 - Open data sourcing
 - GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
 - Mobile technology
 
 Users will have the power of their city’s data in the palm of their hand... through a simple, clean, fresh interface. Even more importantly, it will provide a comprehensible, yet digestible way to take in locally based information in a way that leads to community action and involvement.

 Our App will pull data from several key sources, plot them on an interactive map based on location, and color code them by category. The following data streams have been identified for possible consideration.
 
 + Voting Policies/Information
 -- issues on the ballot
 -- neighborhoods impacted
 -- where to vote
 + Location/Times of City Council Meetings
 + 411 Safety Alerts
 + Volunteer Opportunities
 + Cultural Events","One challenge we expect to encounter is data with vague location connection. Some of the data we wish to display on a map will not have a specific address to reference. We plan to overcome this by developing a method to indicate to a user our “spatial confidence” of a point on a map. For example, if we have high confidence the point will be shaded a darker color, if we have low confidence the point will be shaded with a lighter color. 
 
 A second challenge we expect to encounter is data that is not inherently spatial. When non-spatial data exists, we will need to make it spatial. We plan to overcome this by dedicating some of the resources to developing an algorithm to automatically map events based on the text of the story. Secondly we will create a mechanism for a person to assign a location - this is known as a mechanical turk. While we expect to encounter this challenge, much of the data used by the app will have locat","Our work will be evaluated based on four criteria:

 Ballona Wetlands
 Open House On The Wetlands welcomes people of all ages to explore one of the last remaining coastal wetlands. Our school field trip program brings thousands of students and teachers to view the wetlands up-close through microscope samples, and binoculars, witnessing birds and wildlife that utilize the wetlands.
 
 Kenneth Hahn State Rec.Area
 Elementary and middle school students participate in experiential science-based activities, including exploration of geology, soil, plant life, local wildlife habitat and a good dose of exercise. 
 
 Beaches
 Hundreds of volunteers and students help to conserve shorebird habitat on beaches in LA County. Serving 400+ students, the program explores ecology and stewardship along a coastline visited by millions of people each year. 
 
 Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook
 LAAS’ after-school internship program teams high school students with biologists and restoration ecologists to actively engage in and improve their communities. Students are introduced to the science of habitat restoration ecology through site-specific work and field trips, learning first-hand about managing natural habitat within urban areas. Students will then lead hundreds of community volunteers in restoration work, planting native coastal sage scrub at Baldwin Hills, and restoring beach habitat at Venice Beach. The restoration work is aimed at creating a healthy, clean and safe environment where people and wildlife can thrive.
 
 Schoolyard Habitat
 Building on their knowledge from the Environmental Leadership program, students will assist LAAS College Fellows, LAAS restoration ecologists and community volunteers to implement a new schoolyard habitat at Esperanza Elementary. The goal of this project is to create a healthier schoolyard environment where students can play; and turn a once degraded area into a thriving nature-filled space that attracts insects, pollinators, birds, and lizards, that children and teachers can observe, utilizing the habitat as an outdoor learning center. Habitat plans have been approved by LAUSD officials. The Esperanza Schoolyard Habitat will be the second project of its kind for LAAS and students.
 
 URBAN NATURE EXPRESSED: Collaboration with Venice Arts (described in partnership section below)","In park-poor LA, many urban youth have little connection to nature, and may therefore place little value in environmental stewardship. A recent student in LAAS' Baldwin Hills program, J. Sosa, describes what many in her community experience every day. “Concrete dominates my life. Every day I walk down concrete stairs, through concrete hallways, down concrete sidewalks, toward a mostly concrete school. Seeing a “neighborhood” is difficult.” We view engaging urban minority youth, through service learning, as a key component to achieving long-term conservation success. We further our mission by empowering the next generation of environmental stewards to pursue higher education and career goals that they may not have otherwise thought possible. We host college application workshops. Within our Baldwin Hills Greenhouse Internship program, 100% of graduating seniors have received acceptance letters from four-year institutions.","We track student attendance/hours engaged in all of our programs. We also ask students and teachers to fill out 1-2 surveys about their experience in the programs. The majority of high school students respond that they learned new things about their local green spaces, and that being in the program helped shape a new interest in environmental careers or ways to integrate environmental awareness into a non-science career interest. Students often describe the program as helpful academically, socially, and emotionally. Because our outdoor programs reach youth of all ages, elementary through high school, many of our students will have been exposed to the wide range of biodiversity found in LA, and as alumni, they continue to participate in LAAS programs after graduation. 
 We also measure our success by the number of community volunteers we engage, and acres of restored parklands and beaches that are restored (amount of trash and weeds removed and the number of native plants planted.)","We work closely with local Audubon chapters in species and habitat conservation, but LA Audubon is unique in its commitment to ongoing after-school environmental education programs. Los Angeles Audubon receives approximately $5,000 per year in funding from National/California Audubon. However, as a separate 501(c)(3) organization, LAAS must secure its own funding for local youth and community programs. We collaborate with a network of community organizations (Ballona Renaissance, Baldwin Hills Conservancy), educational institutions (UCLA, 826LA, local schools) and wildlife and conservation agencies (CA Dept. Fish & Wildlife, US Fish & Wildlife) to name a few, that share a common interest in environmental stewardship. Partnerships with key agencies continue to pave the way for expanded student access to natural public lands. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy’s Environmental Initiative has funded and facilitated pilot programs, studies and stewardship opportunities in Southwest Los Angeles County for over a decade. To date, the Los Angeles Audubon Baldwin Hills Internship Program stands out as one of the Conservancy’s most successful public/private conservation collaborations in the region. Creating a work force in the fields of natural resource management, environmental science, urban planning, and environmental education that reflects a true diversity of communities will be key to keeping these fields relevant, innovative, and effective. We are proud of our program’s inclusiveness, serving special education students, academic-achievers, and academic strugglers. All of our outdoor youth programs combine art with science and encourage creative thinking about plants, birds, insects and wildlife found in LA. Each year, we host a Conservation Art Show at an elementary school where students display their own art and act as docents, leading the public on guided tours through the exhibit and in their schoolyard native habitat. The entire student body gets involved via science posters, music, art, and dance performances all themed around nature. The Conservation Art Show includes the LAAS high school Restoration Leaders who contribute to the fun with “pollination poetry,” science “rapping,” and paper-making activities. The LA2050 grant will enable us to connect more people to nature and allow us to add an additional science-meets-art component through our Venice Arts partner.","Building upon LA Audubon’s successful environmental youth education and community programs, we will partner with Venice Arts to implement Urban Nature Expressed, a collaborative, 24-week after-school arts workshop for low-income teens. 
 
 Venice Arts is an exemplary arts organization honored by, among others, the President’s Commission on The Arts and Humanities, whose mission is to ignite youths' imagination, mentor their creativity, and expand their sense of possibility through high quality, accessible media-based arts education programs. LA Audubon views this partnership with Venice Arts as a way for young people to dive deeper into the urban environment by combining art with science and using photography to express their discoveries in a unique and powerful way. The workshop, held at the Venice Arts’ center, will be co-taught by a Venice Arts teaching artist and documentary photographer, and a LAAS biologist/science illustrator. It is projected that 150+ youth will participate in simple experiments in art and science at a Pop-up Gallery and 200+ adults will be engaged both through the young photographers story development process, and through the exhibition of their work. Using the concept of mapping as a framework for both scientific exploration and creative production, participants will explore the six-mile bike path that travels along Ballona Creek, through the wetlands to the Pacific Ocean. In addition to conducting scientific experiments that explore the natural environment, they will investigate the people who populate the path. Creative research will include photographing and interviewing people at three or four key points and identifying a small subset of people with unique and interesting stories about whom participants will create photo essays.
 The project culminates with a Pop-up Gallery in a community adjacent to the bike path. Locations under consideration include farmer’s markets and community festivals with significant numbers of people and ample foot traffic. Teens will staff the Gallery, lead mini-workshops throughout the day, and engage other young people in simple experiments exploring science and art. Information about the Ballona Creek Bike Path will be made available. This Pop-up Gallery not only celebrates youths’ achievements but, also, promotes awareness about this beautiful slice of urban nature. LA Audubon will allocate $20,000 in grant funds directly to Venice Arts to cover costs for their portion of the workshop.","The total program costs for Urban Nature Explored & Expressed will be approximately $205,000. LAAS has secured additional funding from National Fish & Wildlife Foundation, US Fish & Wildlife Service, Disney Conservation Fund, California State Parks Foundation and from private foundations and donors to cover the balance of the program costs. With support from LA2050, Los Angeles Audubon will connect more urban youth to nature and engage under-served communities in improving parks, schoolyards and beaches, protecting threatened species and preserving vital habitat. LA2050 funds will pay for buses for field trips throughout the school year to Ballona Wetlands, Kenneth Hahn, and to the Beaches, for schools that otherwise would be unable to participate. Inner-city youth (high school students and College Fellows) will receive stipends for their work. Under-served communities will benefit from this project, by participating in and creating healthier park environments and schoolyards, where students and teachers can utilize nature as a powerful teaching tool.","LAAS Budget

LAAS’ dedicated education staff has kept pace with the growing interest in our environmental programs by hiring student graduates from our program to work with under-served students as mentors and project coordinators. This year, NINE of our alumni taught workshops at our initial Outdoor Education ‘Boot Camp’ at Baldwin Hills for high school interns and restoration leaders. Additionally, we offer high school students a paid internship to study environmental science. Our program provides hands-on work and research experience, mentorship and community service opportunities, and supports students in their college application process. And, bottom line, the students have fun while participating in this demanding program. We plan to continue to expand our internship program that is investing in the hard work and dedication of our students who are in turn improving green spaces in urban LA. Our future goal is to develop and offer a Community Stewardship Program at a local community college. 
 
 Urban Nature Explored/Expressed will: 
 * foster a strong connection between under-served communities and local parks, beaches and open spaces
 * engage urban students in hands-on stewardship activities that improve LA’s green spaces for everyone
 * empower the next generation of environmental stewards to communicate through art the power of nature in LA
 * invest in unemployed/under-employed youth with paid internships in outdoor education and environmental conservation
 * increase the number of students having access to nature
 * increase the number of children enrolled in after-school programs
 * spark new environmental thinking, research and action through student-led community events 
 * collaborate with partners to develop creative ways to spread the importance of conserving nature in LA"
5102185,Los Angeles Center of Photography Brings Life Changing Photography Classes to Boys & Girls Clubs,2015120,,,"LACP will bring a year-long digital photography program to four Boys & Girls Clubs in LA County. Youngsters from 10-18 learn basic digital photography skills, followed by portrait, street photography and documentary classes, focused on their lives and communities--but also exposing them to careers. LACP will host a final exhibit for each group in Hollywood—heightening student self-esteem by following through with a long-term creative project and helping mount the show.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,Long Beach Boys & Girls Club,Learn,"LACP Founder/Executive Director Julia Dean has volunteered her time to launch a pilot program at the Variety Boys & Girls Club in Boyle Heights. There are four classes of ten weeks each: Basic Photography, Portrait, Street Shooting and Documentary Photo classes. Each serves 15 students, and ideally every student would take the sequence. But there’s some attrition. So “the basics” are built into all classes, letting new students join later classes. Besides technique, the curriculum teaches communication skills, shows the meaning of long-term commitment to a project, and enhances pride as students help mount the show at LACP’s gallery in Hollywood--where family and friends go to the opening. 
 The history of Boyle Heights, where gangs were prevalent, meant youngsters were often forced to stay indoors after school for safety. According to Boys & Girls Club staff, many have a parent who is an alcoholic, drug abuser, or simply working too hard to supervise their kids after school. Boys & Girls Club is a refuge where students are dropped off after school and picked up at 8:00 pm. For LACP, the club is a perfect venue: structured, yet students can participate based on their interests. Through networking with other B&G Clubs in LA County, Julia has targeted three other neighborhoods that are similarly disadvantaged, and contacted the Executive Directors. All are enthusiastic about hosting the program. Besides continuing in Boyle Heights, LACP would use the grant to expand to clubs in Lincoln Heights, Venice and Long Beach in 2016. The program meets the metric of making Los Angeles “a better place to create,” as well as “a better place to learn” in overlapping ways. Instructors will introduce students to many career opportunities in professional photography. LACP adult workshops cover a gamut of classes focusing on photography’s applications to many creative industry specializations--advertising/graphic design, editorial/journalistic, older entertainment forms (film, television, music) and digital ones (gaming, website design and more). Photography is involved in LA’s premier manufacturing industries—fashion, food, furniture, toys and products of all kinds. Students learn about fine art photography, and its ecosystem of schools, galleries and publications. The introduction can inspire students to explore many routes into LA’s creative economy--after high school or through higher education in LA’s community colleges, universities or art schools.","By funding LACP’s photography program at the proposed four Boys & Girls Club in 2016, the LA2050 grant will help us make a definite impact on 60 or more individual students, whose success we can evaluate. This will allow us to make adjustments as needed to the general approach, curriculum and logistical issues that may arise. We hope to strengthen our bonds with current and prospective partners within that network as well. Of course, challenges will remain in continuing the work by raising funds in subsequent years. LACP is already seeking out many sources of support, and will continue to do so. With programs established in different parts of Los Angeles County, we hope to identify potential local funders and sponsors in addition to ones we have already identified. We will be sensitive to do so without encroaching on our partners at the Boys & Girls Clubs.","Though cameras (especially phone cameras) are everywhere, serious digital photography is still a skill to be taught, mastered and perfected. So LACP’s program assumes no prior knowledge, and covers basic photo concepts and skills first. Pre- and post-tests on this “book knowledge” will be administered for each class in the sequence. Equally important, instructors will continuously evaluate the creative work done by each student—a process that will culminate at the end of 2016 as student photos from each club are selected for the final exhibitions. The program director, Julia Dean, will observe classes from time to time, to monitor the effectiveness of the instructors and the students’ progress. A final, extremely useful source of evaluation will be the staff at each Boys & Girls Club location. They will observe classes as well, and will be in frequent contact with Julia to share their insights over the course of the year.","LACP clearly isn't the only organization offering photography classes to young people in Los Angeles County. However, many middle and high schools have seen arts education offerings (in general) cut severely, and have only taken small, incremental steps toward restoring them in recent years. Community centers and some youth-oriented nonprofit arts organizations offer instruction, and some Boys & Girls clubs do as well. (We don’t want to encroach on their work, and are targeting clubs that do not yet have photography programs.) LACP itself offers digital photography courses for teens. For students who already aspire to study photography in art school, institutions like Art Center College of Design and Otis College of Art and Design have pre-college and portfolio preparation classes. But at LACP itself, as well at the colleges, programs are fee-based and students need their own transportation to attend.
 
 Several things combine to create LACP’s unique approach. First, we are reaching out to youngsters where they already are: in their own neighborhoods, at a safe, trusted after-school site where they can receive the highest-level instruction in an art form with many possible career opportunities. The in-depth, four-class sequence is unusually comprehensive. It speaks to their current lives and needs for expression by encouraging them to observe—and honor—their own families, friends and neighborhoods. Yet instructors will be drawn from LACP’s unique pool of dedicated teachers, who are also committed photographers pursuing their own careers across art and professional photography. We believe this can have a immediate and potentially life-changing impact on the young people we serve.","LACP’s partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs is integral to the mission of this outreach program. Leading up to this commitment, LACP has worked in collaboration with Spark and Hollywood Heart (organizations that work with underserved youth), KidSave (a group that addresses the special needs of foster children) and Pablove Shutterbug (a group serving children with cancer)—but these were shorter-term activities. LACP has decided to focus on these four Boys & Girls Clubs representing a variety of geographic areas in Los Angeles County, and they are enthusiastic about hosting the program. LACP will administer the funds, and the clubs will provide their venues free of charge.

 We wish to hold a Human Library on our campus, with other pop-up Libraries taking place across the city in public libraries, community centers, parks, and other public spaces. We will culminate the experience with a storytelling event held at the SIJCC, where individuals will share stories of their own experiences and/or those they’ve learned from others through this project. The storytelling event will build upon the experiences gained and lessons learned by participants throughout the various human library events around the city, and will serve as another opportunity to connect community members from across Los Angeles.","Outreach to various communities throughout the city will be key in order to make sure a broad number of backgrounds and experiences are represented as books, readers, and event organizers. With these funds we will have an opportunity to effectively advertise the event all over the city as well as to rally other organizations to take part and become stakeholders in the project. 
 
 We will also have a paid coordinator and a volunteer committee dedicated to outreach. The committee will work with various neighborhood councils and organizations within the city who represent a wide network of communities to encourage them both to take part in hosting an event and/or to rally their communities to participate.","Our ultimate goal is to connect individuals from different backgrounds who wouldn’t normally interact with one another. We’ll measure this success in a few ways: by the number of people and organizations we connect with before the Library events take place, the number of events that are held around the city, and the feedback received/word of mouth generated afterward. 
 
 Success is connecting with at least 20 organizations to partner on this event in various capacities, and organizing 6 or more Human Libraries in LA. 
 
 Success is a well-attended storytelling event at the SIJCC at the end of this project. 
 
 Success will also be measured through surveys given to participants to learn about their experiences and will be seen in the community’s response once the events have ended (i.e. : if we’re contacted to partner on a future Human Library or other project, or if we hear other communities are implementing this idea.)","The Human Library Organization in Europe pioneered a similar concept. Their Libraries are geared towards discussions of prejudice, with “books” representing LGBTQ identities, mental health issues, etc. 
 
 We’re interested in focusing on geography as a subject, using the Library as a means to contract LA’s sprawl and start conversations about the history and demographics of its most rapidly changing neighborhoods. (We’re especially sensitive to these shifts, as the Center has been located in the heart of Silver Lake for 50+ years.)
 
 Locally, there has also been an annual Human Library experiment on LMU’s campus, which is in its fourth year.
 
 The SIJCC wishes to build upon these ideas and to involve organizations from across the city. Teaming up with neighborhood councils and other organizations will help us to engage diverse folks from all over LA. We’ll help empower organizations and individuals to host events, and to participate as books/attendees/volunteers, etc., putting their own unique spin on this project as well.","We see this as a wonderful opportunity to partner with numerous organizations across the city. We would look to partner with the Los Angeles Public Library, who could host events at various library locations. We would also look to partner with neighborhood councils and organizations who do similar work bringing together people from different backgrounds and geographic regions across LA. We’d also look to other public spaces, like Grand Park, where we could host pop-up libraries.","The cost will ultimately depend on how many libraries we have, and the funds to cover each of them will be divided out and given to each of the event organizers. Below we’ve created a budget for the cost of organizing city-wide outreach, an estimated budget per Library (including training sessions for volunteers), and a budget for the culminating storytelling event. Any additional funds would go to funding more pop-up Libraries throughout the city.","Outreach:

5102194,Los Angeles Review of Books Enabling LA Creativity,2016139,,,"LARB will profile LA writers and artists every day of the year, making the country and world aware of their work, increasing their ability to sustain creative lives by building the requisite critical understanding and infrastructure, and giving LA writers and artists the exposure they need to compete.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"LA has a growing creative community in all the arts. Every week, a new publishing venture launches, a new theater space or new gallery opens, and every day many thousands of us work on a novel or screenplay or song, paint or sculpt, do new media arts, design a building, a dress, or a stage set, or begin filming. But not all of these projects find their audience, locally, nationally, or internationally, and not all can sustain careers over time. 
 
 What LARB can do is help build the audience base for LA’s creative activity, bring news and understanding and appreciation of these projects to our hundreds of thousands of readers across the country and elsewhere—10% of our readers are in CA, 60% in the rest of the country, and 30% overseas—and many are editors, critics, curators, and grantmakers around the globe. By helping create the local, national, and international audience for LA’s artists, we help them put food on their tables and enable their practice, help them pay the rent and create again. For writers and publishers to sell books, artists to sell work and performers tickets and recordings, they need to come to the attention of galleries, distributors, tastemakers, and the press. Reviews like LARB are an important part of that artistic ecology, especially here, since NY reviews have overwhelmingly focused on writers and artists from the East Coast. 
 
 LARB is one of the country’s most successful attempts to decentralize and diversify the artistic and literary conversation; we publish more diverse writers and review more diverse artists; and the more attention our LA artists receive, the more support they can receive, and the more sustainable their practice can be. In addition, since most of the people who do critical writing are themselves artists, in hiring them to write for us, we are helping to support each of them directly as well, in a small way, by paying them for their writing, writing that itself brings them to the attention of a global audience. If a sculptor carves a tree in the woods and no one sees it, her art has not fulfilled its promise; LARB’s soft power can foster and help sustain new arts establishments and creative industries, increase the visibility of women and minority artists, increase recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions, allow graduates to stay here rather than move to NY, and elevate the global influence of LA’s artistic achievements, making LA an even better place to create.","The main challenge is making sure we are finding the full range of artistic activity in the city, in every nook and cranny, and identifying the best, most diverse group of critics to present it to our readers. We have, of course, been doing a good deal of this already. But the challenge will be to identify more artists and groups and critics than we have so far, and make sure that our coverage is truly representative, with critical perspectives that are diverse enough to fully appreciate the range of artistry in the city. We are very confident that with this grant’s help, we can do just that. The grant will help by making available funds to pay critics to write for us, funding for additional editorial staff, funding to provide new, innovative platforms for communities of writers and artists to reach wider national and international audiences, and funding to continue our outreach to individuals and communities throughout the city and county.","We have already been successful in launching and helping sustain the careers of many young LA writers, artists, and critics, and have tracked that success. We collect detailed data on our website’s readership, and we can tell how many people read each of the pieces we publish, and can cross reference that to where the readers are located. We also have records of the writers who have contributed to LARB so far, where they reside, their race, ethnicity, gender, and other identifications, and we have the same data about the writers and artists they review, write essays about, and interview. This grant will help us identify a broader number of writer-critics and have them comment and introduce audiences to a broader swath of LA artists from even more diverse communities. We can track the dissemination of that information across social media networks, in other online conversations, and in the legacy media by measuring increased links, citations, mentions, and other media attention.","There are other organizations—NY Review of Books, London Review of Books, TLS, BookForum, Harpers, The Atlantic—that do work similar to ours, but they rarely attend to LA-based artists and writers, they have older and less diverse contributors and readers, and all have a determined East Coast/Atlantic focus and bias. 
 
 There are local magazines like the new CARLA that focus on LA’s fine arts scene, or PEN USA’s Rattling Wall and Red Hen Press’s LA Review that focus on literature, but they do not have as broad an audience in the city as LARB does, or as much reach beyond LA. LA Weekly, LA Magazine, and LA Times have all cut back their cultural coverage over the last decade in response to the digital disruption of print publishing and the resulting decline of advertising and subscription revenues. We see all these publications as complimentary rather than competitors, as we are all participants in the same cultural conversation, but we are the only serious LA cultural publication that has built a sizable national and international audience (a third of a million unique readers a month, more than BookForum, London Review of Books, or TLS, for instance) devoted to the full range of culture and the arts; LARB covers philosophy and film, comics and poetry, fiction and politics, painting and performance, science writing and TV. 
 
 What is unique in our approach for this project is our deep penetration of all LA’s diverse artistic and literary cultures combined with our national and global reach—the size of our national and international audience of readers specifically interested in creative work, an audience that includes curators, publishers, agents, gallery owners and many others who have the power to enable artistic careers. 
 
 What is also unique about LARB is our proven dedication to bringing new artists, writers, and commentators into the cultural conversation; we use many first-time critics and work with them closely to bring their work up to the highest professional standards, and have helped launch many journalistic careers. This project will help us do much more of that. We also hope that it will help us identify groups of critics and artists who we can help develop additional LARB Channels—affiliated websites with editorial autonomy like those we now publish (including Avidly, Marginalia, Voluble, The Offing) and those in development that represent LA’s Persian, Middle Eastern, North African, Asian, Latino, and other literary and artistic communities.","Our primary collaborators will include the many writers and critics of LA, established, emerging, and just getting started. Some of them will have written for us before, but many of them we will identify as part of this project. Many of these will be well established, some established in their own communities but not yet with access to national and international publications, and for some younger writers this might be their very first publication. The total number of these collaborators will be somewhat less than 365, since some may write for us (or conduct interviews, or make short films or podcasts) more than once. But there will be hundreds of new collaborators in any case. Each will receive payment for their work.
 
 We also will collaborate with a number of existing organizations. We cooperate with PEN USA, with whom we share some board members, and with 826LA. We cooperate with LA Public Library and other area libraries, and will be reaching out to more branches. We work with UCR, UCLA, UCI, USC, CSULA, Emerson College LA, Loyola Marymount, and St. Mary’s College, and will be reaching out to more colleges and universities as part of this project. We have partnered with many local independent bookstores and art galleries and will continue to expand that network. We will be reaching out to community arts centers and other community centers throughout the city and county as part of this project to tap into artistic communities that we haven’t partnered with yet. We have partnered with LiveTalksLA and Literary Death Match and with local book publishers. We have worked with LA Magazine and Flaunt and the LA Times. We work with book festivals and reading series. We have worked with KCRW and are now broadcasting our half-hour radio show at KPFK and other Pacifica stations. We have partnered with filmmaker Kurt Olerud to produce a feature documentary on LA literature. All of these networks we will continue to grow.
 
 We employ a number of graphic design and web design firms in LA, and we pointedly do all our printing in Los Angeles to support that infrastructure. Since everyone who works at LARB also has an artistic life, and since the grantwriters and development consultants we hire specialize in nonprofit arts work, I think that it is safe to say that except for our paper clips and rent and utility payments, 100% of our budget gets reinvested in the creative economy of LA. 100% of this grant will be.","Our current FY budget is $750,000, and with the LA2050 grant that would expand to $850,000. The other $750,000 comes from board donations (45%), other individual donors and family foundations (15%), our membership program (15%), institutional and corporate underwriting and advertising sales (10%), grants (5%), events (5%), and other income (5%). We also rely on volunteer workers (our editor-in-chief, for instance, and many of our writers and editors volunteer their labor). Other serious magazines of literary and cultural commentary have budgets many times the size of ours—Harper’s receives a $4,000,000 grant each year from the MacArthur family, The New Republic has had a $3,000,000 grant each year, and nobody knows how many millions the Newhouse family gives to keep The New Yorker afloat above and beyond their subscription and advertising income. The New York Review of Books was established with help from several New York family fortunes and has a legacy advertising base estimated at some $10 million a year. 
 
 LARB, which is and will always be free to all readers, is still at the seed money stage of its development, and every dollar we spend accomplishes three basic goals: (1) it helps promote the best our culture has to offer, (2) it helps support artists and writers, and (3) it helps broaden LARB’s reach and influence, which in turn expands our ability to attract advertising, grants, and individual members and donors. 
 
 This $100,000 grant will help us directly, in our coming year, and will help us indirectly by broadening our funding base for the future. This particular project, concentrating on LA artists and writers, is only part of what we consider our full responsibility in the service of world culture, but we could easily expand it to many times the size this grant will enable, and as our funding continues to grow (we are increasing at a rate of over 50% a year, and we will continue working hard to grow at a rate at least that magnitude), we can continue to do more in the service of LA culture, continue to help sustain and promote LA artists and writers, and continue helping make LA the best place in the world to create. The budget that follows details a total of $202,850 for this project, $100,000 from LA2050,and the rest from the sources outlined above.","The $100,000 will be used to help pay contributors, to pay the people (editors, AV staff, IT staff, social media marketing staff, support staff) who make the publishing of their work possible and help it effectively reach the largest possible audience, and to develop whatever new channels and platforms that might be required to present this work.
 
 (1) Paying contributors. We are guaranteeing a piece per day for a year by or about a Los Angeles artist or writer. 350 of these will be prose pieces. We will pay between $100 and $200 to each writer of those reviews or essays, or, in the case of interviews, to the interviewer. We will use $35,000 of the funding for this. An additional $17,500 will come from other LARB contributors.
 (2) Paying primary editors. With a combination of volunteer and paid labor, primary editing costs approximately $150 a piece; primary editors identify the work to be reviewed or artist to be interviewed, identify the critic or interviewer, and work with the contributor to ready the piece for publication. This accounts for $52,500 of the total budget.
 (3) Paying other staff. It costs us approximately $30 a piece to copyedit and fact check each piece with a combination of paid and volunteer labor, $60 a piece to post the piece, promote it on social media and to aggregation sites, and otherwise market the piece. This comes to $10,950 and $21,900.
 (4) 35 of the pieces will be short films or podcasts, at an average cost of $1000; total: $35,000.
 (5) We hope that developing these pieces will result in the creation of at least three new affiliate sites (for instance, an LA African Diaspora culture website, an LA Young Readers website) at the cost of $10,000 per website; total: $30,000

 $100,000 of these funds will come from LA2050, and $102,850 from our members, contributors, and other revenue streams.","We have become very aware, over our four years of operation, how every piece of work we publish helps leverage the next. We began LARB with nothing but a handful of volunteers and a single donor. That first year we still managed to publish 300 pieces, attract another couple dozen donors and a steadily growing number of readers. The next year we doubled the number of pieces, doubled our income, and doubled our readership again. We now publish 1500 pieces a year and have a budget of $750,000. We are still ahead of ourselves—that is, we are still relying on volunteer labor, and still not paying enough to compete with the better-funded reviews. But by completing this project, we know that the increased coverage and increased visibility it will bring us will translate, once more, into increased readership and increased income. Each year we come closer to our goal of true sustainability, which necessarily includes better compensation for writers and editors. We understand this as a process of scalability, that every grant, every donation grows our ability to reach that goal. The knowledge that we are already outperforming well-established, well-funded outlets is extremely encouraging. And we are doing so while maintaining our commitment to full diversity, and maintaining our fundamental integrity as a collective of public service-minded people dedicated to the common good. That people are stepping up to support that is even more encouraging. This grant will help us grow, help LA’s creative class survive the disruption being experienced in so many creative industries, and help LA continue to establish itself as the most significant artistic and literary capital of this century. That is to say, we see our scalability completely entwined with LA’s—if we continue to grow, so will LA publishing; if LA’s new media companies continue to grow, so will we. Since we have active interns and volunteers from many area schools, and many from here and elsewhere have been through our summer training program, we are helping to build the editorial cadre of the future, away from the entrenched hierarchies of New York. As we help support the diversity of LA’s literary landscape, we help diversify the conversation nationally, as well. We believe that helping to make LA a great place to create helps the world become a better place, and that is why, finally, we do what we do."
5102197,Los Angeles Trade-Technical College South LA Transit Empowerment Zone (SLATE-Z),2015130,,,"LATTC’s SLATE-Z is a complex strategy that intersects jobs, workforce, education, safety, affordable housing, healthy communities, & business development to tackle an urban center with one of the nation’s highest rates of poverty. Within this broad context, the focus of this proposal is to “CONNECT” South LA residents to increased mobility through (a) free or reduced-cost transit ridership (b) educational technology innovations and (c) educational advocacy/civic engagement.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Learn,"The three strategies highlighted in this project to ""CONNECT” South LA residents to increased mobility through (a) free or reduced-cost transit ridership for co-enrolled high school students ad college students (b) educational technology innovations through the SLATE-Z Virtual Learning Academy, and (c) educational advocacy/civic engagement of parents and residents. 
 
 A frequent barrier to high school students and recent graduates taking advantage of higher education opportunities is related to the cost of transportation. Although students ride at a discounted rate, this is still perceived as a barrier for some. Provide low cost of free transit passes or vouchers will increase the ability to connect high school with the college. In addition, the LATTC SLATE-Z Virtual Learning Academy will be created with these funds, which will CONNECT the region's high school and college and high schools virtually through the development of an online learning community where open and proprietary educational resources will be shared, including adaptive learning solutions for basic skills. These programs are ""smart systems"" which adapt the online learning to the specific needs of the users. Communication between and within the 11 LAUSD SLATE -Z high schools will CONNECT these schools, teachers, students and parents and foster a culture of learning that will enhance educational outcomes in South LA. Parents will be engaged and CONNECTED through virtual and in-person community events around educational policy and SLATE-Z will employ civic engagement strategies that will increase their knowledge of and participation in educational plans and policies. Engaging the community around issues such as the Common Core and LCAP planning and strategies. As a result of this connection and the involvement of governmental agencies in SLATE-Z, the government will be more responsive to the needs of South LA.","The major challenge is the effective coordination of SLATE-Z considering the sheer volume of partners across South LA. We have already started to address this by developing a shared vision among partners, identifying key goals, and utilizing workgroups over the past 18 months. We will address this challenge further, going forward, by designating a Senior Project Manager and Assistant Project Manager to provide efficient and streamlined facilitation of SLATE-Z partner activities. LATTC will provide executive-level leadership to oversee SLATE-Z as a whole, and will work with the partners to develop a governance process.","Two entities at USC have been engaged in this work and will assist in the development and measurement of outcomes to evaluate SLATE-Z community-based programs and initiatives. The Program for Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE) at USC conducts research and facilitates discussions on issues of regional inclusion and social movement building and will be engaged in the development of evaluation tools for SLATE Z initiatives. 
 Housed at the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education, the Center for Urban Education (CUE) is committed to using data, process and bench-marking tools, to help two- and four-year colleges measure equity gaps and outcomes. CUE has been engaged with SLATE and will continue to assist in developing metrics and analyzing key process and outcome data related to educational outcomes.","There is no larger collective impact strategy being implemented in Los Angeles at this time. SLATE-Z involves over 60 agencies, all working together toward the common goal of revitalization of South LA. SLATE-Z leaders identified three major goals and nine sub-goals, all designed to revitalize the community and address the identified needs and illuminate a comprehensive strategy that intersects jobs, workforce, transit mobility, education and community health & wellness. The unique nature of LATTC’s SLATE-Z is in the sheer number of invested organizations, including community organizations; early, primary and secondary education; governmental/public agencies and elected leaders; and business and industry partners. The strategy employed by SLATE-Z is one the reflects this goal - connection. The choice to make this is a ""transit"" empowerment zone was a deliberate decision and the SLATE-Z geographical area served is aligned with the major transit lines running to, from and through South LA.

5102125,Los Angeles Well-Being Project,2015079,,,"The Los Angeles Well-being Project is a collaborative campaign aimed at building the momentum and advancing a shift toward resilience, healthy, and equitable mobility for all. Expanding on the ""Happiness & Well-Being Index"" in Los Angeles from 2014, HappyCity Los Angeles will bring together local leaders in government, civil society organizations, media, businesses, and economists to develop strategies for distributed leadership for policies and practices that make Vision 80 a reality.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,,ALL,"""Let's remember that happiness is a powerful tool for improving health. Creating more happiness in our lives and the lives of the people around us can be one of the most important steps we can take to creating a healthier and stronger world"" – U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy (https://youtu.be/8AMcNQKeKpg)
 
 The Los Angeles Well-being Project’s Vision 80 is a strategy to measure and improve our current state of well-being to lead us toward health, rather than sickness – while shifting toward resilience, healthy, and equitable mobility for all. First implemented in Bhutan in 2010 with the concept that was introduced in the 1970s, Vision 80 is intended on gaining momentum in major cities across the U.S. 
 
 The concept implies that sustainable development should take a holistic approach towards notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of well-being. Furthermore, the concept has been explained by its four pillars: good governance, sustainable socio-economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation. 
 
 The process to make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live will be examined through the lens of exploring our well-being by first defining what Los Angeles needs to thrive, then to get the data that would show how Los Angeles measures up and lastly by getting the community and government leaders together to take action on what is needed to make the improvement.","As a former board member of the City of Los Angeles' Neighborhood Council system that implemented the first Health & Wellness committee, one major challenge is the “education/awareness” around the subject matter of “well-being”. The vast majority at this time defines “health & wellness” as issues related strictly to physical exercise, smoking, and diet. Yet the term well-being reflects a holistic range across ten (10) values which include: health, access to education/culture & arts, governance, community vitality, time balance, work, psychological/financial well-being, social support and environment. 
 
 We are currently at the tipping point of making this game-changing shift and winning the LA 2050 Grants Challenge will help to overcome this challenge coupled with a clever messaging campaign that would educate the public on this multifaceted subject matter in the most simple and catchy phrase.","The Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80 will be evaluated based on a single index ranging from 0 to 100 with the goal to exceed 80 based on the data collected from respondents from the Gross National Happiness Index surveys. An example of the output that this methodology can provide can be seen at the website: http://www.happycity.us/los-angeles.html
 
 In order to work in conjunction with the goals set forth by LA 2050, our “Los Angeles Wellbeing Project’s Vision 80” will aim to target meeting those goals by 2050.","In 2013, the City of Santa Monica was awarded $1 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies to launch the ""Santa Monica Wellbeing Project"" (http://wellbeing.smgov.net/about/wellbeing-project). HappyCity Los Angeles will work collaboratively with the team to adopt its methodology to expand the work beyond Santa Monica to the Greater Los Angeles. 
 
 Our approach will be unique in that the goal would be to expand the work in the future to other cities across the U.S. with Los Angeles leading the way via the outcomes from the ""Los Angeles Well-Being Project"".","A 20% allocation of the $100,000 grant award is currently estimated for our partners.

In doing so, we will likely be able lower the cost by 25-35% and rather than creating our own technology platforms to use as tools for the data collection, we will use a low cost or free platform such as those offered from Google and/or partner with organizations such as the Happiness Alliance to use their resources to reduce the overall technical infrastructure costs of the project.

5102221,Los Angeles Youth Entrepreneurship Pathway Initiative,2015145,,,"NFTE Greater LA proposes to expand our program enrollment to reach additional youth in the Los Angeles community. We also propose to build a pathway and continuum of support between our current program offerings: Exploring Careers (middle school), Startup Tech (middle school app development program), Entrepreneurship (high school), Startup Summer (alumni accelerator) and Alumni Programming that addresses the NFTE alumni ongoing needs for support in their business, career and education goals.",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,None,"Entrepreneurial thinking and behavior are crucial skills for success in the 21st Century. We live in a world that looks fundamentally different than ever before – with economies evolving faster and more fluidly than in the past. One in three employers say they are looking for entrepreneurial experience in their potential hires. To be successful in today's workforce, youth need to know how to recognize opportunity, take initiative, solve difficult problems, and remain resilient and confident in the face of challenges. NFTE Greater LA is working to equip our youth with entrepreneurial skills that will benefit them for a lifetime. Funds from the LA2050 Challenge will enable us to expand our program enrollment and build a pathway for students to progress through NFTE’s program offerings.
 
 Exploring Careers: Exploring Careers is a curriculum targeting middle school and early high school students. It provides youth with an opportunity to learn about the variety of industries in which they may wish to pursue a career. Students gain a foundation in entrepreneurship and develop a business concept in their desired industry area. Students pitch their business ideas in a science fair-type format to an audience of peers, family and the school and business communities. NFTE has a second textbook and accompanying training and program materials to support the Exploring Careers classes.
 Entrepreneurship: Teachers draw upon our 11th edition textbook, Entrepreneurship: Owning Your Future to teach entrepreneurship concepts. Along with the textbook, The NFTE program includes experiential activities that connect these concepts to “real world” situations. For example, during the Wholesale Field Trip, students are given $25 to purchase products from the LA Fashion District to resell at a school selling event. This activity helps students practice negotiation skills, calculate their breakeven point, market their products and deliver great customer service. Activities like these occur throughout the class, keeping students engaged and excited through hands on learning. Throughout the class, students research and write a business plan (both a PowerPoint as well as a narrative form business plan.) At the close of the course, students compete in a series of business plan competitions that begin in the classroom and proceed to the national level.
 
 Startup Summer enrolls 15 advanced NFTE grads annually to seed and launch.","We are seeking the most effective internal partners within Los Angeles Unified School District to assist us in expanding our programs throughout middle and high schools that offer business programs. With many competing priorities and changes in leadership, we are continuing to seek the right advocates to advance our goals of expansion within LA Unified. At the same time, we continue to grow our presence in the Greater Los Angeles region through referrals from current teachers and principals who place a high value on our program. We are also continuing to build traction with smaller districts and local charter school organizations to advance our goal of growing our reach.
 We will also undertake a strategic communications effort to address school administrators and decision-makers within our target market, elevating awareness of our program successes and enlisting additional partners in our work.","The NFTE Program Team uses Salesforce to monitor completion of our core units of learning and our key experiential activities.
 To measure our impact, we use:
 * Pre-Post Testing: Schools implement our standard pre- and post- test survey to capture short-term outcomes of entrepreneurship education related to the 'entrepreneurial mindset'. These surveys assess NFTE's impact on students' career ready skills.
 *Periodic Knowledge Assessments: NFTE students take part in a Diagnostic Assessment at the start of NFTE, and a Summative Assessment at the close. They also may take four unit assessments throughout the course to track their knowledge gains. These tools are analyzed by NFTE's Research Team and enable us to pinpoint areas in need of further focus.
 Outputs:
 1. 2,300 students served
 2. 90% of students will complete business plans in 2015-2016
 3. 90% of students will demonstrate a 15% increase in business knowledge
 4. 80% of teachers will fulfill their Teacher Objectives Contract","NFTE works alongside Junior Achievement, Project ECHO and Academy of Business Leadership. All of our organizations empower youth through financial literacy and business leadership, but the differences between NFTE and these organizations are:
 1) We specifically focus on low-income youth.
 2) We have an award-winning textbook aligned to local and national educational standards, and require that our students receive a minimum of 65 hours of instruction in entrepreneurship.
 3) The NFTE program is taught by experienced educators, who receive additional support from our cadre of volunteers.
 4) In LAUSD, Hawthorne and Downey School Districts, NFTE has been approved by the UC system as a G elective class, so students can receive UC college credits while in high school.
 4) In 2002, NFTE received the Golden Lamp Award, the highest honor in educational publishing, by the Association of Educational Publishers. In 2010, our 11th edition textbook was the winner of the AEP's Distinguished Achievement Award for best mathematics curriculum for grades 9-12.","Should we be selected, NFTE will continue to engage our school partners, community organizations and university partners in expanding our work.

5102181,MADE in Long Beach: Fostering independent entrepreneurship to accelerate the local economy,2015118,,,"Localism is developing a “trifecta” business accelerator, culinary accelerator, and tech makerspace called MADE. We create opportunity for innovative local entrepreneurs, and lower their risk threshold to help them grow. Our vision is to make these projects scalable, sustainable and repeatable for diverse communities.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,Long Beach; LA County,Learn,"MADE is a project that promotes “local self-reliance,” as defined by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. Our project aims to a) attract and keep talented people; b) use place to connect opportunity for all; and c) use place to accelerate civic engagement. MADE’s model advances independent entrepreneurs by 1) mitigating the early stage risks to starting a retail brand or opening a storefront; 2) mitigating common pitfalls and barriers by directing entrepreneurs through “pipelines” such as permitting and distribution channels; 3) attracting cross-marketing value to these businesses by utilizing technology and Metcalfe’s Law (the network effect); and 4) providing “hosted retail” so local business owners can focus their time and money on making their goods rather than renting space to sell their goods. Localism has also developed a technology and media platform to strategically provide these businesses with advantages typically reserved for major brands. The extent of this project is to develop a scalable, sustainable and repeatable model for diverse communities.
 
 Primary prototype participants are independent entrepreneurs who have a product, a business growth plan, and reflect the socioeconomic diversity of the locality of Long Beach. Secondary prototype participants are product makers who can scale through manufacture, merchants who plan to open storefronts, and artisans who can increase their value by elevating their craft and training apprentices.
 
 Currently MADE showcases products from over 100 local makers and merchants, distributes products to key destinations such as 
 Renaissance Hotel, Working Class Kitchen, and is working with the Long Beach Airport, and the CVB for further exposure of the MADE in Long Beach brand. In the first 10 months since opening at least 25 living wage jobs have been created, half of which are tech jobs. Several of these businesses are ready to expand beyond MADE and are actively looking for space to lease. Over 200 makers are on the waiting list to get their products in MADE, many of which are cottage foodmakers. MADE is seeking funding not just to expand facilities, but also to increase to capacity to foster the types of great businesses that reflect the unique character of Long Beach. In addition to our incubator services, we have hosted over 50 events, ranging from fashion and art shows to hackathons and maker expos. We also offer innovation-based STEM classes for children and adults.","There are two obstacles we have identified. 
 
 1) Complex permitting processes for small businesses
 We have started the permitting process for MARKET so that we can have a Certified Farmer’s Market at least three times a week in our store, in addition to sales of cottage food products. This will allow us to provide affordable, freshly prepared foods to the community. We have also started research and a ""permit pipeline"" for this project, in partnership with the LB Health Department and LB Fresh.org.
 
 2) Engaging diverse communities
 We have partnered with the Arts Council for Long Beach and like organizations in order to activate community spaces and engage the community. MADE’s physical venue and organizational structure provide a nurturing hub for artists and other creatives, providing the support and structure with which to build sustainability and success.","Primary participant impact of our accelerator by evaluating the following basic factors: increased financial well-being of participants based on living wage income, and increased business revenue growth. The secondary, wider participant impact is measured in numbers: increased number of products produced and sold, increased participants able to lease retail space, increased participants able to distribute to additional locations, increased creation of jobs and hiring of local residents. In addition, we understand our broader responsibility to the local community. We utilize media campaigns to move people from Apathy to Awareness, but when we track behavior we don’t always see Awareness resulting in Action. Through our platform we offer incentives and tools that motivate people to move from Awareness to Action, with a change in their behavior to support their local community. Then some are inspired to Advocacy which completes the circle. The incentives allow us to track actionable data.","Our model is unique because it is comprehensive. Our approach is based on organizations who provide similar services such as The Hood and FabLab. However, because we target retail, food, tech and supply the tools necessary to develop products, we are able to offer a one-stop hub for making, dining and shopping. This will also allow us to increase locally made goods and therefore increase money that is reinvested into the community. We will be closing the gaps that chain establishments miss -- guaranteeing a living wage for their employees and sourcing labors and goods locally. Studies show that by purchasing locally, 3 times more money stays in the community than with chain purchases.","We have already started engaging the community and are seeing results by developing projects in partnership with local BIDS, merchants, artisans, community organizations and residents. In particular, we are collaborating with the Arts Council for Long Beach, Long Beach Fresh, the Growing Experience, Slow Money SoCal, California Endowment/Building Healthy Communities, the Long Beach Health Department and the State of California Department of Public Health.","To date we have raised $36,770 through a crowdfunding campaign. Overall, we are raising $500,000 through diverse revenue sources (please see our response to scaling), but the project can be completed within a $400,000 budget. Grants and loans are anticipated to offset funds required, with potential grant and loans totaling $150 - 250k, which leaves $250 - 350k as the investment opportunity for community stakeholders and investors.","INCOME

 We are planning to build out a large industrial kitchen in the back 1/3 of the 12,500 sq ft space at MADE. It will be rented out to up and coming foodmakers for blocks of 4-8 hours at a time. A culinary accelerator is for food businesses that have plans to grow by packaging and distributing their unique products. Long Beach does not have a culinary accelerator, and currently many of our foodmakers have to leave Long Beach to develop their businesses. To be conservative in our projects we estimated 4 foodmakers renting our kitchen space at $30 an hour, but only for 18 hours a day. 
 
 Culinary goods
 The foodmakers who rent the kitchen will have the option to sell items at wholesale to MADE for retail sales. Only selected food prepared in the incubator kitchen will be packaged and sold at MADE, and some foodmakers will be using the kitchen for catering. Additionally several local and regional farms have partnered with MADE to offer fresh produce, eggs, honey from local fields, and regular grocery items such as artisan bread, pasta, spices, coffees, and 40+ local food brands. This math is based on 100 food sales a day at an average food sale price of $10. 
 
 Retail goods
 Retail goods encompass all the non-food items that are sold at MADE. There are currently products from over 100 local makers. This estimation is based on one main aspect: By increasing foot traffic with food there will be increased exposure of non-food re
 tail departments at MADE: furniture, home & garden, bath & body, artisan jewelry, books & music, hand-assembled bikes and biking accessories, lamps & candles, apparel, baby and children, greeting cards and more. As MADE matures it will resemble a local department store with a market space. These are based on 60 vendor/40 MADE consignment sales.
 
 Distribution
 Distribution is a volume play and a positioning play, with a focus on key destinations such as The Renaissance Long Beach, and fine local establishments such as Working Class Kitchen. 
 
 Because these models are based on amount of product and fees, they are scalable for the growth of clients that we receive. Moreover, we do make revenue by renting out facility space for events, for which we charge 50%."

BookArtsLA, though our “Make a Book, Read a Book” program, will engage elementary age students by teaching the art of handmade books. Teachers trained by BookArtsLA staff will visit elementary classrooms in the LA area to both create books that enhance student learning but also, at the same time, teach classroom teachers the concepts and techniques of making books. Once the program is completed at each school site, classroom teachers should be able to use these skills to enhance classroom learning for any grade level. 
 
 BookArtsLA, in collaboration with site administrators and faculty, will work with the chosen grade level to design and implement a project related to one subject area, e.g. science, social studies or language arts. 
 
 This program will target grades 3, 4 and 5 for the initial project. BookArtsLA will train two teams (of two teachers) to deliver a program to a class once a week, for 1-2 hours, for 4 consecutive weeks. Schools may have more than one class in the program. The class teacher will participate in the program along with the students creating a potential mentor for other teachers.
 
 An unfortunate by-product of the new State and Federal Standards is the teacher’s perception that the classroom teaching is constrained by conforming to the standards. BookArtsLA believes it is possible to create a learning environment that uses some unconventional methodology to meet all of the curricular needs of teachers and students by teaching a subject more deeply via the production of student made books.

5102277,Making California Friendly Plants Mainstream to Drought Proof Southern California,2015189,,,This transformative public education campaign will make California friendly plants hotter than pokemon circa 1995. How? We're going to take existing water community efforts to the next level with pioneering data science and unleash some cool new creative videos and books to convert the best change-makers: kids.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Across the Southern California region,0Create0Live,"California faces its worst drought in over a century, compounding long term trends. The state's water supply system was largely built a generation ago for a state with half the population, and in recent years California's key water supply resources in the Bay Delta and Colorado river are under stress from rising usage, climate change, and long-term geological damage.
 
 On April 1, 2015, Governor Brown stood in the Sierras in an empty field normally five feet deep in snow at this time of year and declared a historically unprecedented statewide 25% urban water conservation mandate. With outdoor landscaping representing roughly half of urban water usage, Governor Brown and the water community have identified ornamental lawns as a key opportunity in the larger effort to increase water conservation.
 
 For generations, lawns have occupied a special place in the California mind. The Post WWII era saw abundant material wealth and water supplies, which manifested in lush lawns and landscaping. D.J. Waldie memorialized this lifestyle in his book “Holy Land.”
  
 “The seven model yards were planted with mature shrubs and full lawns… Buyers waited in line, some watching their children in a supervised playground.”
  
 Former State Librarian Kevin Starr highlights the broader connection to suburban life in his book “Golden Dreams.”
  
 “…a place where middle class Americans might love, reproduce, succeed, fail, live, and die in American circumstances enlivened by day-to-day hope and immemorial pleasures, struggles, questions and rhythms of daily life.” 
  
 We’re launching this campaign to educate the next generation of Californians on how simply shifting from thirsty ornamental lawns to California friendly landscaping can increase our drought resiliency dramatically and deepen our connection to our community.
 
 Rather than struggling like Biggie Badger and his friends with over-the-top water conservation actions like bathing halfway or skipping showers, we can save the water we need simply by converting lawns we aren’t using for anything except decoration to beautiful drought friendly landscaping.
 
 Moreover, this generational shift in outdoor landscaping offers a great opportunity to get to know your neighbors and understand how we’re all dependent on the environment that was here before us.","Far too many people think the plants native to Los Angeles start and end with cactus. As Irvine Ranch’s Water Issue Survey from June 2015 illustrates, “customers are not aware of the potential of drought-tolerant landscaping to be more than a “desert” look.” We're going to confront that barrier head on by showing how beautiful California friendly plants can be and educating families on the merits of drought friendly landscaping.
 
 We're working with a big coalition across the water community and So Cal civic life to change this landscape paradigm. Bringing together leading water utilities, nonprofit partners and civic data science talent, this project is focused on supporting and building on existing water community efforts to break through those myths and achieve a “tipping point” towards market transformation. 
 
 The goal is to show the value of California friendly plants so that the ""new normal"" of outdoor landscaping is drought tolerant.","Number of households converted to California friendly landscaping. Our target with this hundred thousand dollars: 1,000,000 households with California friendly landscaping across Southern California. We're working closely with academic researchers using NAIP satellite imagery to study the diffusion of California friendly plants and will use the results of that study to help evaluate how many Californians this campaign converts to new landscaping. In addition, for a separate yet synergistic project we're working on pioneering a voluntary, bottom-up effort to put the entire lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized platform. That database will enable us to ask at a granular level the actual water savings of shifting to California friendly plants and target areas for future landscape maintenance education.","We are laser focused on California friendly plants as the next frontier of water conservation. The water community is spending millions of dollars on general conservation messaging yet there's a big opportunity in public education focused on California friendly plants. The history of water conservation market transformation (low flow toilets for example) has shown that transforming conservation behavior requires an integrated regional approach. That's exactly what this campaign will deliver.
 
 More than one-half of California’s urban water usage goes to outdoor landscaping, and in making California friendly plants mainstream, Southern California has the opportunity to cut that usage by more than half, achieving a million acre feet in sustainable conservation. SCWC’s California Friendly Plant Campaign will build on the unprecedented regional turf rebate momentum -- the largest outdoor rebate program in American history -- and many recently browned lawns to achieve a “tipping point” in making California friendly plants mainstream with the big goal of converting one million households to California friendly landscaping in six months.","The Southern California Water Committee (SCWC) has deep relationships with the water community and civic leadership across the region. We intend to continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Water District, LADWP, Moulton Niguel Water District, Upper San Gabriel Water District, Foothill Municipal Water District and countless other water utilities. In addition, we will leverage our ""civic reach"" through our board and ask the Good community to help extend this campaign from that base into community nonprofits, local schools, and across the spectrum of civic life.
 
 We recognize that this historic drought is an issue that demands that all of us -- water managers, teachers, environmentalists, video artists, and everyone else that calls this place home -- work together as Californians.
 
 Climate change challenges future water supply assumptions, yet by working smartly and collaboratively, we can prepare California for whatever the future holds. This positive, proactive public education campaign represents a golden opportunity to build on momentum in turf rebates and seize the opportunity to plant seeds for California’s sustainable water future this winter.","We have budgeted $250,000 for the campaign. We anticipated substantial in-kind resources from our utility partners (such as workshop and materials production) along with coordinating existing resources and public education efforts. In addition, we are currently fundraising through additional grant sources and water community working relationships. This campaign is flexible and can scale up or down depending on the level of resources we receive. Additional funding will be used to develop a ""micro-VC"" fund to strategically fund actions by community organizations like the YMCA to help make California friendly plants mainstream. This investment will pay long term dividends, and as a back of the envelope calculation, the value of a million acre-feet of demand reduction across the next 50 years is worth over $18 billion in today's dollars assuming a 5% hyperbolic discount rate. 
 
 Yet with ~2% market penetration from rebates, we are firmly in the early phase of making CA friendly plants mainstream and the path forward to turf market transformation is by no means guaranteed. Imagine two very possible scenarios of where we could be a year from now:
 
 1. Balkanized efforts lead to lost momentum towards market transformation
 Utilities are confused about the next step in market transformation after rebates and there's lots of balkanized ad hoc efforts – varying rebates without a regional focus, sprinklings of workshops, etc. After spending half a billion dollars and forcing people to brown out their lawns, the rain returns this winter and many Californians re-establish their lawns. CA friendly plants don't become mainstream and most folks think native plants mean cactus. 
 2. Integrated effort reaches the tipping point to turf market transformation
 The water community coordinates it's marketing and public education efforts in partnership with community nonprofits like California Native Plant Society, CA Conservation Corps and a host of other local groups. That sustained, focused community level effort aligns with regional marketing messages to make CA friendly plants mainstream and beautiful drought tolerant yards become an environmental status symbol like a Tesla or Prius. This ""new normal"" of CA friendly plants doesn't mean eliminating all turf for purposes like sports or children playing though removing the vast majority of ornamental turf saves Southern California a million acre feet in demand and safeguards our water future.
 
 Let's choose 2.","Educational CA friendly plant conversion videos: $30,000. This fund will produce a series of 5 short, <2 minute videos articulating the value of California friendly plants in a fun and engaging manner. $5000 will be dedicated for an open prize for the best short video on the subject.
 
 Book Production and Distribution Costs: $20,000. The Big Drought offers an engaging children's story and CNPS approved curriculum in order to encourage children to come home and convince their parents to convert to CA friendly plants. The book will be made freely available and distributed to libraries and elementary schools across Southern California.
 
 Hire a lead water data scientist: $50,000. Building from lessons learned in modern data-driven political campaigns, this effort will use data as the nerve center to coordinate CA friendly public education efforts regionally.","The data science work in this public education campaign integrates into a long term strategy to drought proof Southern California. A group of leading water utilities are working together to put the entire lifecycle of California's water usage data in a centralized cloud platform through a new initiative called the ""California Water Data Collaborative"" being developed in partnership with UC Davis Center for Water and Energy Efficiency and the California Urban Water Conservation Council. This project offers a long term investment in improved data infrastructure across the water community with a spectrum of operational efficiency and demand management benefits. Analytical experts can work together to achieve water efficiency to:
 • Collaborate within and across utilities, as well as with a range of other stakeholders;
 • Improve utility system performance, including leak loss detection and repair, pressure management, and prioritization of projects within capital improvement programs;
 • Benchmark water and energy use across customers, customer classes, and utilities;
 • Assess the effectiveness of demand management strategies within a utility and across utilities;
 • Improve the effectiveness of data generated from AMI systems;
 • Improve demand forecasts for water wholesalers;
 • Streamline and standardize reporting to the California Urban Water Conservation Council, state agencies, and other agencies and organizations;
 • Better understand the impacts of various conservation actions including but not limited to rebates, public education, and marketing;
 • Evaluate the effectiveness and equity of different rate structures;

We'd hold live workshops for anyone curious about 3D Printing & new technologies, & give people tangible experiences with these products. The makerspace will also allow people to use 3D Printers without buying them so they can experience the technology without making a big investment, but can buy a printer if from our showrooom.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"LA will be the best place to create because it is in the intersection of a growing movement between media (Hollywood) & technology (DTLA & Silicon Beach). LA is very unique in the sense that no other city in the world is able to mesh digital content media & technology into a something synergistic & unlike any other before. 
 
 At its core, content media is the information & experiences directed towards an end-user or audience. At its core, technology means doing something better than ever before. Both content media & technology require creation & LA has all the right qualities in creating synergistic opportunities for its residents. We can personally attest to this as founders of EEZITEC have backgrounds in high-tech & digital media content creation!
 
 We would like to create opportunities for artists, designers, & engineers by leveraging 3D printing technologies that can benefit all sides of the equation. Most recently, we completed a project with UCLA & their adaptive sports program where we were tasked to create rapid prototypes of replaceable footplates for the adaptive sports wheelchairs. We did this in the shortest deadline possible of only 3 days. Within 3 days, we measured dimensions, analyzed tolerances, & created a working prototype that was unveiled at UCLA's Angel City games. This would've been impossible through traditional manufacturing when traditional lead times require much longer times. 
 
 By enabling people of diverse backgrounds to create, we're giving them the freedom to inspire others to do the same. The technological advancements in 3D printing also continue to improve at an exponential rate. 
 
 With a makerspace, we'll provide a place for people to create, network, and learn. A place where they can bring their imaginations to life with 3D Printing. Any ideas they have for a physical product, they can create a prototype or working model through 3D Printing. By using 3D Printing, people will be able to create whatever they'd like in a tangible form, making it a perfect technology for creative endeavors.","One major challenge that we anticipate is not growing fast enough. We're currently bootstrapped & we continue to grow but we can't afford to stagnate or slow down anytime soon. Though, being aware of this has always put us on our toes & we continue to achieve goals we've set for ourselves.
 
 We're a scrappy bunch of individuals making a profound fundamental impact. Our spirits are indomitable considering we've gone through personal & professional barriers that's shaped us for the better.","We evaluate our work primarily through the number of inquiries we get & how much of that translate into 3D printer sales & consulting projects. We will put a heavy focus on customer service and make sure that we ask our customers on how we can improve to make their 3D Printing experience enjoyable. We will have surveys and polls for our customers to answer so we can get a better sense on how we could improve. Also, we will make sure that our friends and colleagues in the 3D Printing industry are also giving us input on our Makerspace, so we can ensure that we provide the best education and products.","There are a few mom & pop shops that's started in 3D printing. We know some of the local ones here in LA & they're complementary to our line of business. For example, Cokreeate focuses on 3D scanning, while LA3-D works primarily with students. EEZITEC is friends with both Cokreeate & LA3-D. There is LA Makerspace but it doesn't offer products for sale nor services for people who want to customize 3D Prints.","No, we are not working with any partners outside of Eezitec. The grant money will be utilized by the founders & team members of Eezitec in expanding our 3D printing efforts across LA so the $100k will solely go to Eezitec's Makerspace to make sure it operates at its peak potential.","We believe a Makerspace would cost $250k, which would go towards rent, products, employees, marketing, & additional overhead costs. With that being said, we're bootstrapped & gritty & we're not picky with the prize money. As a media-eCommerce tech company in LA, we can do a lot with $100,000. It is enough to help us achieve our goals 10x. We appreciate what we can get & have been firm believers in turning something small into something bigger than ourselves. 
 
 For additional costs, we would find ways to increase sales on our eCommerce platform to re-invest into the Makerspace, as well as find ways to increase other revenue streams such as customizable 3D Printing jobs & other 3D Printing related services.",The split will go as follows -- 25%: Operational Growth; 37.5%: Company Growth; 37.5%: Growth hack Marketing.,"EEZITEC is a media-eCommerce technology company in LA & we will be growing our efforts here in our home base. Being a technology company gives us a competitive advantage where digital content & products are deployed online through EEZITEC.com. As previously mentioned, we're capital efficient, have low burn rates, & we're more than 120% confident that the $100,000 grant will be utilized effectively in continually making LA the best place to create.

5102182,Manufacturing Opportunities for Modern Day Rosies,2018072,,,Rosie the Riveter illustrated how women factory workers could fill manufacturing jobs during WW II. Today women workers have few opportunities in the US transit manufacturing industry. The Modern Rosies Project aims to recruit women to factory jobs and influence manufacturers to hire women. Our travelling exhibit of modern day Rosie the Riveters raises awareness of the hardworking and capable women who are building America’s 21st century transportation and reminds people that women CAN build,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"Jobs to Move America advocates for policies that incentivize creation of quality jobs when transit agencies like LA Metro procure buses & railcars. Through the Modern Rosies Project, we will increase recruitment, training, hiring & support & promote equity & safety programs for women in the LA transit manufacturing industry.
 We will do this by advocating for strong policy language supporting women’s equal inclusion in manufacturing jobs to be adopted by transit agencies as part of the bidding documents under the JMA US Employment Plan & by manufacturers through JMA partner agreements. The Modern Rosies project is part of this advocacy.
 The Modern Rosies project will seek to: Change perception of women’s roles & abilities in the manufacturing workplace; create opportunities for women in transit manufacturing; highlight the issues facing women in manufacturing & promote women’s achievements in the industry. 
 We will:
 Address discrimination, sexual harassment, wage, & leadership gaps, & use policy and education to change the industry’s approach to hiring, training, & promoting women, & develop or strengthen programs to train & support women in manufacturing.
 Win policy language with LA Metro and other regional transit agencies that sets standards for hiring, promotion, training & retention policies & practices and work with companies on best practices.
 Bring women’s groups into our LA coalition and build a network of supporting groups.
 Establish a women only Pre-Employment Training Program & a pilot program for welding & electrical workers.
 Coordinate job training, job placement, support & retention services provided by our partners.
 Choose an employer to implement a pilot program for women in the industry.
 Work with training providers & employers to recruit more women & place them in manufacturing jobs.
 Support women workers with on-the-job mentoring, women’s peer groups, professional development, links to support services, & leadership development.
 The outcomes of the project will be:
 The WomenCanBuild exhibit is shown in at least one other location in LA, such as Cal Tech.
 At least a 10% increase in representation of women in LA’s transit manufacturing workforce over five years.
 Reduced complaints of discrimination & harassment. 
 Successful outreach program to women & girls.
 Developed pipeline for women to enter manufacturing with support systems","Women face barriers to success in manufacturing plants that build heavy equipment where there are virtually no women welders, electricians, painters or general assemblers. There is rampant sexual harassment, pay & promotion disparities & limitation of opportunities because of the perception that women are not capable of doing heavy manufacturing work, although a modern factory makes this case redundant.
 To overcome these obstacles, we will advocate for policy language in RFPs put out by LA Metro & other regional transit agencies that requires bidders to commit to anti-sexual harassment & pay equity programs; create programs to work with community & educational institutions to overcome gender discrimination & low representation of women; build a committee of Modern Rosies (women working in LA transportation manufacturing) & train them to make presentations, speak to the press, advocate with their employers, & inspire young women to see themselves as “modern Rosies.”","The work will be evaluated based on data from transit agencies, employers and our partner organizations as well as surveys of women workers and employers of women and independent research.
 Our primary criteria for evaluating the success of WomenCanBuild over time will be:
 The number of women hired for transit manufacturing jobs in the region 
 The % of women in LA transit manufacturing compared to the national rate of 13% 
 The experience of those women based on surveys.
 The experience of employers with their women employees based on surveys
 The increase in manufacturing activity in the LA region and particularly transit manufacturing.
 The number of formerly incarcerated women and women veterans who receive training and are hired in manufacturing jobs.
 The recruitment and retention rates for women in manufacturing.
 Number of transit manufacturing jobs created in the region","JMA is the only program that will increase US manufacturing jobs in the transit industry and the that advocates for bringing more women into that industry through contracting policies and public pressure.
 The JMA policy, when adopted by transit agencies for their procurements, results in recruitment, training, hiring & support for disadvantaged workers including women. LA Metro was the first transit agency in the country to adopt the policy for its procurements & we are already seeing more women hired for manufacturing jobs under Metro’s contracts as a result. This project will allow us to develop additional gender specific policy language and advocate for the adoption of that language with transit agencies.
 JMA is the only organization that is linking policy, outreach, organizing & arts & culture to fight for women’s inclusion & fair treatment in manufacturing jobs created in the massive build out of the LA transportation system. 
 We use art to promote Modern Day Rosies in our travelling exhibit “Women Can Build: Re-envisioning Rosie,” a photography exhibit including a research report revealing the overlooked contributions of the skilled and hard-working women who build our 21st Century transportation, channeling the spirit of Rosie the Riveter. 
 The Women Can Build exhibit features large photographs by Pulitzer Prize winner Deanne Fitzmaurice and stories of 15 modern day ""Rosies,"" alongside never-before-exhibited historic photographs of WWII era Rosie the Riveter manufacturing workers from the Library of Congress, connecting past and present.
 We are the only organization that we know of in LA that is educating manufacturers—industry wide-- about recruitment, training & hiring of women as well as treating them fairly once on the job. JMA’s workforce development task force that works with manufacturers includes academics, workforce agencies, unions & other experts who assist manufacturers in managing issues related to women in manufacturing.
 Our partnerships are also unique. We have partners like WINTER that bring special expertise in placing women in non-traditional jobs. Other partners include technical colleges & union apprentice programs that have expertise in providing training for women in non-traditional jobs, & workforce development agencies that refer women to training programs. 
 Only JMA provides the unique connective tissue to bring the job creation, policy incentives, & training programs to transit agencies & manufacturers","Partners in creating and providing training for women include LA Trade Technical College, Transportation Department; IBEW Local 11 electrical workers union apprenticeship program; LA County Federation of Labor, AFLCIO, and SMART Local 135, the sheet metal & railroad workers union apprenticeship program, among others.
 Partners in recruiting women for manufacturing jobs include Playa Vista Jobs & Women in Nontraditional Employment (WINTER).
 Our academic partner in LA is the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at USC.
 We partnered with the LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the launch of the Women Can Build photography exhibit at Union Station. As LA Metro issues RFPs for manufacture of buses & railcars, we will work with the agency to ensure that the strongest language regarding training, jobs & support for women is included in the RFPs & that the bidders’ ability to comply with those standards is a significant factor in selection of the winning bid.
 We also collaborate with LA area manufacturing employers including companies that have already worked under JMA policies—Kinkisharyo International (Japanese firm), BYD (Chinese firm), Bombardier (Canadian firm). As RFPs are issued, we will seek out new firms that are willing & capable to abide by JMA policies & support women in manufacturing.
 We plan to use $80,000 of the award in personnel expense to employ a full time JMA/LAANE staff person to manage the project. We will subgrant $10,000 to WINTER to work with LA area companies & recruit women and with LA Trade Tech & other schools which, along with union apprenticeship programs, will provide training to women in manufacturing skills. 
 We will allocate $10,000 for the cost of mounting an additional photography exhibit at either Cal Tech or another iconic and appropriate location in the region","We believe that $100,000 is sufficient to launch the Manufacturing Opportunities for Modern Rosies project and to operate during the project’s first year. We will use existing staff to support the new project coordinator. In particular, we will allocate 20% of the time of Jake Williams, a mechanical engineer on our staff who is developing the overall apprenticeship curricula for transportation manufacturing jobs, & 20% of the time of Nadine Levyfield, our communications specialist, to help develop collateral material, maintain & upgrade the www.womencanbuild.org website & to support periodic media events. We will also continue to raise additional funds to expand the project to other cities outside of LA County and to travel the Women Can Build photography exhibit to New York, Illinois and Washington DC.
 Jobs to Move America has other foundation, private & union support to cover general operating & program expenses as well as project staff. This would be the first grant for the Modern Rosies Project, which will be a significant expansion of the Women Can Build photography project, which was launched in May through an exhibit at LA Union Station. This grant would allow us to build a broad based advocacy and public education project to pressure for the inclusion and fair treatment of women in LA’s newly expanding transportation manufacturing industry.","JMA Women Can Build Project Coordinator salary: $60,000

 National JMA supports regional JMA coalitions in the Greater Chicago area, Sacramento & the Greater New York area. We expect to establish a presence soon in upstate New York, Minneapolis-St. Paul, & Washington State as funding becomes available. We will organize professionally curated WCB exhibits in some of these locations in partnership with the federal government & large transit agencies to seed the ground for an expansion of the larger Modern Rosies project.
 Regional transportation agencies such as LA Metro, Metrolink, Long Beach transit, California High Speed Rail and a new high speed rail line between LA and Las Vegas have projected many billions of dollars’ worth of projects for which there will be RFPs for manufacturers over the next 10-20 years. We will continue to work with these agencies to ensure that recruitment, training, hiring & support for women workers will be a priority in each of these RFPs. Overall, we believe that, with a strong program, LA can continue to attract and retain large bus, railcar and related parts factories to the LA region and create a model, modern manufacturing sector that reflects the values of inclusion and diversity that are part of the LA 2050 plan.
 While hiring and inclusion of women in major industries has been a renewed topic of conversation in major media, that discussion has primarily focused on hiring of professional women and support for women in executive positions. The fact that women are so unwelcome and excluded from LA’s heavy manufacturing workforce (where jobs tend to be better than in the growing retail, service and food processing sectors) is seldom discussed in the media or in the halls of political power. The reality is that women have to muster huge courage to apply to be welders and electricians in LA factories in the face of so much prejudice and harassment. That is why the Modern Rosies project is a crucial component of an agenda for a progressive LA future and will continue to grow in LA and around the country,"

Rates of self-reported depression during pregnancy are significantly higher among ethnic minority and low-income women. But many of these women do not seek treatment due to various barriers, including stigma, financial and insurance limitations, transportation issues, lack of childcare, and other concerns. As a result, mothers and their children are exposed to the negative impacts of untreated depression or anxiety, which include poor birth outcomes, prematurity, low birth weight, emotional dysregulation in the infant, difficulties with attachment, and developmental, cognitive, and emotional difficulties in the developing child.
 The unique challenges listed above make the perinatal period an ideal one for instituting a collaborative or integrated care model that treats both the medical and mental health needs of a woman and her family - under one roof. 
 Between 2012-2015, Maternal Mental Health NOW oversaw a pilot project aimed at improving the behavioral and physical outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women through a collaborative care project based on the IMPACT model, at USC-Eisner Family Medical Center, a federally qualified nonprofit community health center serving Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles. Today, Maternal Mental Health NOW is working to refine and spread an effective model of integrated perinatal mental health care into additional medical settings, including pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, primary care, and hospitals throughout Los Angeles, collect data on selected outcome measures, study its impact on the health and well being of pregnant and new mothers and important aspects of their relationship with their new and developing infants. The end product will be to create a guide, which will provide resources to other medical sites wishing to do the same.","Based on its experience at USC-Eisner FMC, Maternal Mental Health NOW anticipates that the biggest challenge it will face is achieving real practice change at each participating medical site. Despite weekly meetings at USC-Eisner FMC, we learned about inconsistencies and discrepencies in screening, referral and treatment procedures. In addition, we were unable to collect data that demonstrated the impact of the project on patient outcomes. To address this, we have devised a range of levels of perinatal mental health care integration, starting at Minimal Collaboration through to Close Collaboration. Moving forward, our goal is to move medical sites from one level to the next. In addition, we will hire a Quality Improvement Manager whose sole responsibility will be to build relationships with each medical site, troubleshoot procedures and protocols to help each medical site improve its level of perinatal mental health care integration, and ensure compliance with data collection.","Following recommendations of the AIMS Center at the University of Washington, we will work with each medical site to track the following processes and outcomes in order to evaluate our work:
 
 • Number and proportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks with significant clinical improvement
 • Total number of patients discharged
 • Total number of patients active
 • Proportion of active patients receiving any kind of follow-up during the past month
 • Average number of contacts since treatment started
 • Average length of time in treatment
 • Proportion of patients in treatment who have been reviewed by a psychiatric consultant who has made recommendations to the primary care-based treating medical/behavioral health providers
 • Proportion of patients in treatment for at least 10 weeks who are not improved and who have not been reviewed with the psychiatric specialist.","Several organizations across the country, including the University of Washington AIMS Center, have demonstrated the impact that a collaborative care model (integrating mental health care into behavioral health care settings) has on patient outcomes.

 • Case studies of three medical settings and their experiences with the New Family Care Team project;
 • Recommendations for HIPPA compliant, web-based registries;
 • Self-assessment tool for integrating perinatal mental health care in a medical setting;
 • Additional resources for achieving perinatal mental health care integration.
 
 Once published, the guidebook will be distributed in print and via online channels to The California Improvement Network and other partners and stakeholders. As a result of the best practice guide, medical settings throughout the state and beyond will be able to utilize Maternal Mental Health NOW’s recommendations so that the model of integrated perinatal mental health care can spread."

The program uses a peer-to-peer learning model to create a schoolwide college and career success culture. An evaluation by ACT, Inc. found that the odds of enrolling in college at 85% higher for Career & College Clubs students, than for a comparison group. 
 
 While there are many college and career readiness programs for high school students, there are very few of these programs for the middle school years, a pivotal time in the development of student behaviors, attitudes, and work habits; and there are even fewer programs that address the total child as does Career & College Clubs – providing the content, resources, and support system needed for the development of both academic and social-emotional skills (including communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creative innovation), so students at an earlier age have the knowledge, tools, motivation, aspiration, confidence, and drive to stay engaged in the learning process, enthusiastically plan for their future, and promote a college-going culture among peers schoolwide. 
 
 Since 2008, Career & College Clubs has empowered more than 50,000 middle school students, including 91% of participants from racial/ethnic minorities, 71% Hispanic, and more than 60% of their parents having no postsecondary education. The program was recently recognized by the White House as a ""Bright Spot"" in Hispanic education. 
 
 We have 30 school sites in LA County, including 22 in LAUSD. 
 
 If approved, this proposal will allow us to expand to 20 more sites. 
 We will focus the expansion on sites that have a high percentage of at-risk students, as measured by the % of students eligible for Free and Reduced Price Meals. We will recruit, train, and support these sites over the next three academic years as they engage int he materials and help their students achieve their dreams. 
 
 Our first outreach will be to LA County school sites who have expressed interest int he program, but who are unable to share in the program's costs. There are well more than 20 of such sites.","The single biggest challenge for the program is 'competing' with the myriad other initiatives, programs, directives, etc. that vie for educators' time. 
 
 In sum, working is a public school is incredibly difficult...even for the most gifted and dedicated educators. While the will is there, they often do not have the time or energy to implement Career & College Clubs. 
 
 We overcome this challenge by making the program as easy as possible to implement (2-3 hours per week for 1 teacher or counselor) and providing instant support for them when problems arise (and they always do).
 
 Also, extending the implementation period for three years allows the sites to ease-in to the program. We've found that the first year is always rocky, the second year is when they start to feel confident, and by the third year most sites have made the program their own.","We ask every student int he program to complete pre- and post- surveys designed to measure attitudinal and behavioral growth.
 
 We also have an ongoing partnership with ACT, Inc. to measure the long-term impact of the program. ACT looks at student outcomes in high school, college enrollment and, eventually, college completion. So far, they found that Career & College Clubs has exactly the kind of impact we had hoped - more students are thinking about their futures, making plans for, and actually enrolling in, postsecondary education.","There are no organizations doing the same work - career and college preparation, in middle school, using peer-to-peer learning. 
 
 Career & College Clubs does compliment many other efforts - AVID, GEARUP, Linked Learning, etc., and we find our sites often implement them jointly","We will first identify 40-50 target schools in LA County, based on their FRPM percentage. Starting with schools who have already indicated an interest in Career & College Clubs, we will then approach to let them know of the opportunity provided by LA2050. If they agree to sign on, we will begin the process of training their staff and getting the program established. 
 
 Other than fees to Career & College Clubs (which this grant would cover), the program is inexpensive for schools. Their costs are minimal.","Total cost to ALL Management Corporation for adding 20 sites is approximately $420,000. The additional costs will be born by ALL Management Corporation, using revenue derived from other education-related activities.
 
 Our goal is to have 200 sites, total, by 2019-20. ALL Management has committed the financial and human resources to achieve the goal.","Program fees for 20 schools for 2016-17: $60,000

Those efforts will continue, the grant from LA2050 will accelerate that process and, most importantly, make the program available to LA County sites who want it but are unable to afford even $1,667 per year in fees."
5102322,Models of Mobilization,2015214,,,"TreePeople will conduct a pilot-to-scale project in two communities that will determine what inhibits and motivates people to take specific environmental actions related to rainwater harvesting and tree canopy, based on socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental characteristics. With the information we learn, we will create models to mobilize similar communities throughout LA, which has the potential to reduce water importation by at least 40% and increase tree canopy to an equitable 25%.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,The pilot will hone in on Huntington Park and Pacoima. Countywide scaling to follow.,0CreatePlayLive,"To meet LA’s needs, TreePeople’s Strategic Vision goals over the next 10 years are to increase tree canopy throughout LA to an equitable 25% and to develop a water supply that is at least 50% locally sourced. Our proposed program, Models of Mobilization, will engage Angelenos in making LA more livable by creating replicable models to inspire changes at the community level related to climate resilience, air quality and water conservation. 
 
 This innovative series of hands-on pilot projects, based in multiple schools as well as two environmental justice areas, Huntington Park and Pacoima/NE San Fernando Valley, will develop models of community engagement to scale throughout LA County.
 
 Activities include the following:
 • Teach rainwater harvesting practices to at least 700 households, covering turf removal, drought-resistant landscaping, and rainwater harvesting techniques;
  
 • Test best practices with residents in Huntington Park to increase tree canopy through long-term stewardship of the urban forest through tree planting and tree care activities;
  
 • Engage residents in under-served areas of the NE San Fernando Valley to explore rainwater harvesting and landscape transformation at residences and schools;
 
 • Train and support at least 150 teachers to bring water conservation and recycling action projects to their classrooms and schoolyards; guide at least 4,000 students in projects on campus, impacting 150,000 students across LA County.
 
 To prepare for bringing this program to a wider scale, these pilot projects will use of Community Based Social Marketing practices through tree planting and tree care programs with local residents, as well as student training and teacher professional development in K-12 schools county-wide.
  
 Carrying out these projects encompasses the following steps: 
 (1) Assess environmental needs; (2) Gauge community readiness; (3) Test behavior change strategies; (4) Connect with new and current partners; (5) Educate and train communities about simple and practical ways to improve urgent and longer-term environmental issues; (6) Implement projects (turf removal, landscape transformation, rain barrel installation, tree planting and tree care) at residential, community, or school sites; (7) Follow-up with participants to analyze endurance of lifestyle changes; (8) Evaluate data based on socioeconomic and geographic characteristics; and (9) Create models for scaling up to effect larger change.","Since 2012, TreePeople has had an active exchange with multiple Australian cities, to learn from their experience with a 12-year drought. We have learned of several barriers to engaging in eco-friendly behavior, which range from lack of knowledge to busy lives and financial strains. The approach we are using involves deep listening to understand what prevents people from taking action. For example, in low-income environmental justice areas like the communities in this project, we’ve found a major barrier to be the cost involved with implementing tree canopy and rainwater harvesting activities. TreePeople is addressing this barrier by working with businesses, local government agencies and utilities to provide rebates and other financial incentives that render the costs to next-to nothing. At the same time, we are testing types of rewards (monetary, social recognition, altruism) that prove most effective at sustaining the behavior long-term for those who do take initial actions.","Ultimately, we will consider the project a success if it produces replicable models that can be implemented more broadly in similar communities in the LA region. Short-term success is based on outputs listed previously (homeowners trained, rainwater harvesting projects completed, residents and students engaged, trees planted and cared for). Measurement tools include TreeMapLA.org, a mobile tool created by TreePeople that tallies eco-benefits of trees based on their individual traits, like species and size. Water benefits will be measured by square footage of landscape transformed, and/or gallons of rain captured through rain barrels. We will use CBSM surveys to measure people-related results related to barriers and motivators. TreePeople uses an organizational database, Salesforce, to record and store all program data, such as workshops given, number and identity of attendees, project volunteers, quantity of rain barrels distributed, location, number and species of trees planted.","TreePeople has led much of the effort to capture stormwater at the parcel level since the 1990s – work that is now coming to notable fruition. A Multi-Agency Collaborative (MAC), initiated and facilitated by TreePeople is focused on integrated management to capture stormwater in a distributed, decentralized way (see Partners section). Supporting this are results of the Stormwater Capture Master Plan, completed in 2015 as a result of TreePeople’s partnership with LA Dept. of Water & Power. Both the MAC and the Master Plan highlight the need for distributed stormwater capture at homes and schools in order to build a local water supply over the next 20 years.
 
 We are taking a comprehensive approach to the issues of water supply and tree canopy, partnering with and training neighborhood councils, industry professionals, and home improvement stores to create a holistic nexus of support that will reach a maximum number of community members who will what they need to make water-friendly changes to their homes. This network will create a groundswell of “innovators”, which will lead to a large mobilization of the public to capture rainwater at home. 
 
 TreePeople’s comprehensive emphasis on both policy change and community engagement – a “top-down and bottom-up approach” is rare among environmental organizations. TreePeople’s role as a leader that coalesces people and guides them to take responsibility for their own homes, schools, and neighborhoods is unique. Nobody that we know in LA can fill those shoes at the present time. 
 
 That said, we believe strongly that sustainability is achievable only with an engaged, committed, educated, and prepared populace and we must work in partnership with other environmental and community organizations as well as government agencies in order to do so. TreePeople is the only nonprofit in LA that is touching upon all audiences – the schools, government agencies, corporate partners, the media and the general public – to drive change toward rainwater harvesting as well as a healthy tree canopy. There are other organizations, that are focused on planting and caring for trees and we often work together on a project basis - such as City Plants, Northeast Trees, and LA Conservation Corps. We also work regularly on water policy issues with Heal the Bay and Council for Watershed Health.","TreePeople’s partners are critical to its work, as they are the vehicle that moves our ideas forward. The philosophy of all of TreePeople’s programs is to engender a sense of personal responsibility to care for the environment, which is the best way to influence long-term environmental stewardship. To that end, our most important partners are those who connect us to the people of Los Angeles. These include the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance, Communities for a Better Environment, Pacoima Beautiful, and hundreds of K-12 school campuses. 
 
 TreePeople is leading a revolution in water conservation in Los Angeles, through a Multi-Agency Collaboration (MAC) with the three leading water agencies: LA Dept. of Water & Power, and LA County and LA City Public Works Departments. Other strategic relationships, including MOUs or other contracts, have been established with multiple government agencies including LA Unified School District Office of Sustainability, Metro Area Transit, US Forest Service (Angeles Forest), City of LA Dept. of Recreation & Parks, and City of Huntington Park. Industry and corporate partners include Tetra Tech, ARCSA (rainwater catchment professionals) and Macerich Malls. 
 
 Our community-based partners play an important role in the pilot, as they provide the milieu for our outreach efforts and they essentially have a ready-made constituency with clearly defined sociological indices. At the community level, TreePeople will provide trainings to homeowners, school children and water industry professionals. To do so, we are partnering with home improvement stores and retail malls, the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association (ARCSA), plumbers’ union, and the Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance. Trainings will give audiences vital understanding of new technologies and practices related to landscape transformation, cistern installation and care, and proper use of multiple forms of water.","The lean budget to carry out Models of Mobilization in the two communities is $305,000. The supportive elements, including policy and systemic policy work, along with work with the schools, increases the comprehensive and supportive budget to $1,030,000. We have funding for most of the supportive elements but are seeking funds from the LA2050 Challenge to launch the pilot project in the communities of Huntington Park and Pacoima.","TreePeople

Because we believe strongly that the only way to ensure LA becomes more sustainable is to lead people in taking personal responsibility for the environment, we have designed this project to create turnkey models based on socioeconomic, geographic, and environmental characteristics. These models will then be ready to be applied in communities with similar characteristics. 
 
 To support scaling, the MAC is also bringing the public water agencies together to determine how to achieve similar goals at the systemic level. The MAC is helping to break down walls that have existed between these agencies – and their budgets – for decades. The long-term results could include more efficiency in resource management, along with funding to support community-based and home-based projects in our region that provide multiple benefits for the public, including water security, water quality, flood protection, energy efficiency, access to green space and local jobs.
 
 Scaling efforts will combine the data and models produced by this project with our “success formula” which multiplies the following: (a) Educating and engaging people with nature-based solutions (landscape transformation, rainwater capture, etc); (b) Developing and implementing communications tools and strategies to mobilize a critical mass; (c) Creating partnerships at the community and systemic levels for better urban ecosystem management; (d) Drive policy changes that promote green infrastructure at all government levels. 
 
 Much of TreePeople’s community-based work is focused on environmental justice areas, where pollution is high, eco-assets are low, and socioeconomic challenges are immense. When people think of human rights, they often think of civil liberties, workplace protections, and the right to happiness. Trees and water aren’t what usually come to mind. But it is trees and water – and their many benefits – that have a tremendous impact on wellness and health. Bringing people together for community projects that raise the environmental assets makes neighborhoods cleaner, healthier, and more livable."

We need money to help with student tuition, musical instruments and teacher salary. The students also want to start dancing! So, we're trying to purchase shoes & clothes for them.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The Learning Center (TLC) In Reseda, CA",ALL,The students from AMB will be performing at many events around LA bringing awareness to the blind community and opening hearts. We're already packing houses in Santa Monica and most recently at summer music festivals.,"Money has always been our one major barrier. We need money to cover the costs of tuition for students who can't afford to attend AMB. We also need to provide many kids with their own instruments so they can practice at home. Music has changed these blind kids life! Once they learn a little, they want to go far and not stop. We had to close down for 2 months last spring because we couldn't afford to keep our doors open. It was devastating to the kids & their families. We have an incredible team of teachers, parents & supporters, but that isn't always enough.","We're able to see a difference immediately at AMB. We now have 6 new students who are already thriving and playing solos on guitar & piano. Maybe blind children are shy and reserved and afraid to be extroverted. Within 3 weeks of coming to AMB, they're singing their hearts out, doing new choreography and asking their parents for their own instruments. We also have students who, because of their musical talent, have gone on to play in public and even sing at National baseball games! You can see so many videos on youtube of the joy they're bringing to LA!","There is no place in the world like AMB. We teach each student One on One and attend to all their musical needs. There are blind choral groups in LA that are wonderful and the Braille institute, but nothing like what we do at the Academy. We push our students to excel beyond their disability. We challenge them to learn new music and we give them a stage on which they can show LA who they are. We've been featured on numerous news programs and Josh Groban's foundation Find Your Light awarded us a small grant last spring to re-open our doors for the summer. Josh, an LA native, saw a video of one of our 5 year old students singing and fell in love. Our approach is very personal with each student and also very professional. We see this kids as musicians, and not 'blind children.' They feel that and gain a confidence that stays with them forever.","We have recently opened a 2nd location in Whittier because we have many students in Orange County that can't make it to Reseda. We would love to use some of the money to help that location stay open. Every week we hear from new perspective students who want to come learn music at AMB. We'd also use the money to continue to bring music around LA from our students. We've sung for events at the Lions Club, at Churches & Synagogues and next month at the Moss Theater on October 18th! We also want to record a CD of all the students and use it as a way to raise awareness of the blind and share their incredible music with the world. But basically, the grant money will allow AMB to keep its doors open to its current students for 2 years!","At AMB we take it month by month and having this kind of money would mean we could breath and know we'd be open for almost 2 years! The kids would all get their own guitars!! 
 However, we apply for other grants weekly and have been having some good luck. 
 Josh Groban's FIND YOUR LIGHT Foundation gave us $10,000 last spring for us to stay open through the summer. We're always looking for more angels like that.","15,000: Office Manager (1250/month for 12 months)

 The One Life Los Angeles project will teach students to create effective messages for visual media, focusing on building the skills to author narrative elements and produce high quality images. Students will be challenged to construct innovative messages that communicate their own perspective on the issue of living in Los Angeles and contribute their own ideas on ways to best utilize social media for mass communication to promote it.
 We will have a total of 8 workshops in 8 corners of Los Angeles County. Each workshop has up to 20 students, divided into 5 groups of 4. These groups will each produce a 30 – 60 second Public Service Announcement (PSA) designed specifically for distribution online and eventually on local television. A total of 40 PSA’s will be developed by the conclusion of the workshops. 
 This innovative program is designed to empower youth to express and communicate the prevalence of living in their city and community while teaching them the skills using visual media/arts and increase their employability by providing job skills training. 
 
 The program objectives include:
 • Teach students skills in narrative authorship, visual media, and film production. 
 • Teach students about the social issues and community life.
 • Engage students by capturing their interest in visual media and utilizing their knowledge of social media channels. 
 • Inspire students to become community stewards and effective communicators on important issues. 
 • Demonstrate an example of utilizing social media in non-leisure pursuits

Our goal is to introduce health strategies to underserved individuals so that they can incorporate into their daily life wellness practices that benefit and maintain their physical, mental, emotional and life-philosophy health.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,,ALL,"Dharma Health Institute offers health and wellness services, and education for the health culture community. Health, longevity and quality of life are a passion for us; we believe good health is a shared personal and community responsibility. We treat clients who have or are at risk for diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease, obesity, chronic diseases, anxiety, depression, pain issues, and others who are pursuing a healthier lifestyle. We are a resource for partner clinicians of various disciplines that find it beneficial to add Dharma services to their clients’ health and wellness regimen. All healthcare practitioners are licensed by the State of California to provide primary healthcare for children and adults. 
 
 Dharma Health Institute offers classes in Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, Dharma Youth, Family Fitness as well as a number of Preventative and Integrative Health services. We also offer acupuncture, acupressure, nutrition, herbs, and nutraceuticals, as well as number of integrative modalities such as Hyperbaric Oxygen, Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP), Infrared Sauna, Neuroplasticity and Mental Health services. 
 
 We want to introduce our health services to those who do not have the means to create a holistic approach to their health and wellness. For example, one of our community partners shared the story of a 30 year-old Latina, mother of three with a weight problem. She has not yet been approved through her Medi-Cal HMO to see a dietician and is experiencing anxiety, depression and symptoms associated with pre-diabetes. She has two special needs children, and a host of her own adverse childhood experiences. She and her children could access services at our Dharma Institute. In another case, a 67-year-old Viet Nam Vet suffers from PTSD and depression, has high blood pressure, an enlarged heart, diabetes, poor circulation and struggles with his weight. He receives medical interventions at his local VA and has received acupuncture, and claims “This has helped me more than all the medicines I have received.” However, due to the restrictions of his health benefits, his access is not consistent. He would benefit from Dharma services. Or, in a different kind of situation, there is a new mom that needs to reduce her stress: Stroller-yoga or tai chi might be perfect for her. 
 
 With support, Dharma will be able to serve people in these kinds of situations and that need a sliding scale for fees.","“Many diseases are preventable with minor lifestyle changes.” Master Zi
 
 In today’s society, people seek quick fixes to health. Our challenge is constructively working with this mentality. One client shares that she wants to lose weight but in the same breath also says that she wants to eat and enjoy her life. She doesn’t want to stop having fun. Her concept of healthy living is life void of joy. Yet, her 76 year old brother-in-law who has been involved in several of our programs dines at wonderful restaurants, looks years younger than his age and has a zest for life. As practitioners, we want to have her experience that doing things to support wellbeing does not mean taking enjoyment out of life. We invite the whole family to engage in life practices and family members to support one another in sustaining health practices. Also, our members offer support (by phone, after class, individual lessons, going for tea/coffee or lunch) as people begin this journey.","Participants will complete a pre and post examination to help in monitoring their progress. One monitoring system we use is the InBody scan: Assesses Percentage of Body Fat, Body Mass Index, Body Strength, Intra/Extracellular water, and Visceral Fat to assess whether at risk for chronic conditions. It can be used with all ages. EKG: Assesses cardiovascular health and heart strength. And, one of our team members is a specialist in evaluation. 
 
 At intake, we will assess an individual’s eligibility for subsidized fees. At various points throughout we will ask clients how they are doing, to help catch early issues, as well as give guidance and encouragement; building relationships is important. At the completion of services we will collect Client satisfaction data related to the specific services they received. We will use data regularly collected by the various machines and progress notes from our files. Collectively, this will provide an evaluation picture of clients’ changes.","We offer knowledge and skills for individuals to take care better care of themselves and become stewards of their own wellbeing.
 
 Dharma benefits from decades of intense integrative health and martial arts training, study, practical applications and commitment by its co-owners. Our quality of life programs set us apart from many competitors in that we also draw from the Vedic Sciences and neuroplasticity. We help individuals with integrating nutrition, physical movement, and techniques to shift their consciousness towards healthier living and psychological, social and mental good health. 
 
 Our multidisciplinary staff considers the best modalities for each client. We can take victims of crime insurance and traditional medical insurances. We offer health trainings via SKYPE. Our practitioners are culturally/linguistically diverse (Spanish, Hindi, Urdu). Our clients, too, are diverse: students, mothers and babies, families, professionals, retirees, etc.","Our partners are individuals that have benefited from the work and have their own life practice. 
 
 We work with medical doctors, a professor from Loyola Marymount University, which is the head of the Asian Studies program, Chinese medical practitioners including acupuncturists and herbalists, physical therapists, social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, as well other institutions. We also teach at various venues including Malibu Fitness and Loyola Marymount University. For events, we partner with local businesses including Rawvolution and Simply Wholesome, a natural food grocery store and restaurant, locally owned and operated. We donate to a number of organizations including One World Health Project, a non-profit organization training health workers in Africa and South America, Firefighters association, Race for the Cure and local companies holding raffles or community fundraising events. Based on the number of clients we receive and the health issues they are experiencing, the partners will receive monetary compensation for their time. The fees calculated will be sliding scale and thus it is hard to assess how much each partner will receive. Within our organization, there is an understanding of Dakshana, giving a portion of the knowledge received, so we consistently have volunteers working alongside us administratively as well a teaching. This is foundational to our work; it, too, sets us apart from some other organizations. If we receive this grant, these volunteers will receive a small payment for their assistance.","We have already created a very warm and welcoming institution for our existing community and are a fully equipped integrative health clinic. This is the first grant we are applying for to support our goal of expanding services to other populations. Most of the funds associated with the grant will be spent on subsidizing the client services and funding practitioners to assist with the increased demand for our services. We have a number of volunteers already in place that give of their time. While the grant money will not cover all of the costs, our current community of staff understands this is a learning and educational institution and does not rely on our Institute for a full income. 
 
 We are already an established business. Some of our other machines not yet mentioned include: 
 
 Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP): Increases the blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle and decreases the amount of work the heart has to do to pump blood to the rest of the body. This is an excellent machine for anyone experiencing cardiovascular issues, diabetes and many chronic diseases that result from being obese. This machine is under used by cardiovascular clients because many people do not know about it and/or insurance has stopped paying for these treatments so it is no longer affordable. 
 
 Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber: Clients are placed in a one-person chamber where 100% oxygen is circulated. The oxygen is pressurized so the air pressure is 2-3 times greater than normal. As a result, the lungs and skin absorb more concentrated oxygen in a shorter period of time. This allows for growth of new blood vessels with reduced circulation including artherosclerosis, aids in treatment of infection, diabetic ulcers, MS, macular degeneration, and helps restore brain function. 
 
 Infrared Sauna: The infrared lamp sauna penetrates deepest due to the fact that the heat source is all concentrated in a small area, and not due to the frequencies of the energy used. It is also an antioxidant nutrient, activates the cells, supports metabolic processes and decouples toxins from water molecules. Infrared sauna therapy is one of the least costly, safest and most powerful ways to eliminate toxic metals, toxic chemicals and chronic infections. 
 
 If we see that we may run over, we will try to make up the difference through various insurances or an additional grant.","Clinicians (10% of time) (5 total): $25,000

We have a number of quantitative metrics that will assess whether people make improvements on health related measurements such as Body Mass Index, Percentage Body fat, the amount of strength increasing in their muscles, and the decrease in visceral fat. Based on the Prochaska model of Stages of Change, an individual cycles through various stages before they incorporate the lessons into their life and maintain it. We will use the Stages of Change model to develop a pre-post test survey to assess the ability of an individual to maintain the newly adopted behaviors into their life. 
 
 In addition, we will collect qualitative data in the form of personal follow up with clients to assess their mental and emotional well being as a result of their ability to cope with their illness in a healthier way. 
 
 For us as an organization, we will assess success by having the opportunity to provide integrative health services to a wider population and offer the community at large an opportunity to learn strategies and techniques to live a healthier, a more productive life and be empowered to make health decisions based on the knowledge they receive."

Through the use of advanced technology, and business community and local government resources, the program will allow students from the City of LA to compete with students from all over the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Palisades Charter High School; Pacific Palisades; LA County,00PlayLive,"Palisades Charter High School (PCHS) represents a microcosm of Los Angeles, serving students from over 100 zip codes across the city. Los Angeles is one of the most economically vibrant areas of the country, and students have the potential to work in a wide range of fields. Despite this, students are unprepared for planning a career path. Colleges lament that students do not have defined goals, and employers report that young people lack skills. PCHS will expand opportunities by launching a robust Career Services Program that exploits the potential opportunities in our thriving City for our student population. 
 Existing non-school based programs are fragmented and are challenged in trying to engage students. With busy schedules and transportation challenges, students need access to information on campus. Incorporating career planning into the curriculum is the best way to engage youth. We believe this program will be impact the larger community by connecting students to the workforce across the City. 
 We will make LA the best place to learn by taking the following actions: 
 1) Spring Workforce Fair – Event that brings local businesses and other organizations on campus to offer employment and internships, as well as educational workshops on workforce readiness skills. 
 2) Internship, Job, and Mentorship Placement – Placements through the Workforce Fair, and a web-based portal of other job, internship or mentor opportunities. 
  3) Coordination with Academic Curriculum - Integration into the classroom curriculum, starting in the 9th grade through completion of an Interest Profiler in freshman English classes, and a writing component on career choices. Using the interest profiler, academic and college counselors will share guidance on educational paths to careers.
  4) Career Exploration and Counseling - Opportunities to learn about careers through presentations by professionals in various fields. Help with employment coaching, resume writing, interview practice, and job search skills. 
 5) Student Outreach - Use of student groups such as Village Nation, Black Student Union, Fuerza Unida and Latino Student Union to ensure reaching a wide range of students. 
 We are inspired to level the playing field for all students across Los Angeles. Our hope is that, through establishing an innovative Career Services Center at one of LA’s largest public high schools, this model can be replicated for all high school students across the city.","The challenge is to educate parents that it is important to begin exposure to careers in high school to support future decisions regarding college or other higher education. 
 A career services program will lead to broader exposure to career paths which will impact future college choices. This active communication design plan implements the following:
 • Workshop to explain necessity of module completion to successful personal future choices
 • Impact report from College and Academic Counselors and Faculty
 • Career Counseling Innovative Student-Centric Center - Place for technology use and mock interview sessions
 • Communications Plan to Publish our Successes (via Social Media & Direct outreach to stakeholders groups
 
 A second, related challenge is to enlist the wide support of the broader community and making it easily accessible to students. This is addressed with dedicated staff and development of online resources.","The PCHS Career Center will be evaluated in year one through measurements of use and access. Indicators will include:
  
 # Freshmen who complete career profiles by May (2015-16 academic year);
 # Freshmen who complete career profiles by December (2016-17 academic year);
 Attendance at the Workforce Fair and job skills sessions;
 # Students placed into internships and jobs;
 Attendance at career panels;
 Reports from Pali Career & College software programs
  
 To ensure widespread access, we will also track the number of unique students who have accessed any single service.
  
 We intend for this program to be self-sustained after the initiation grant. We will seek an academic partner to conduct a longitudinal study to provide more robust outcome information on student career achievement. We believe that the students will be gaining skills that will serve them long after they graduate from high school.","Our research complement organizations are public high schools with similarly diverse and large student populations. We did not find any comprehensive career services program. Instead, they appear to be non-functioning, or a small component of a more robust college program. 
  
 El Camino High School - links to college and career center information with many “click through” links directly to Pierce College and Valley College. Features 4 career choice links - STEM/STEAM, Engineering, Sustainability (Go GREEN), Healthcare
 Granada Hills High School - No on-line job search tool to public (it may be encoded for students only). Career services support appears to be a part of college services program.
 Santa Monica High School - Naviance/Family Connection for 
 Career-interest search. Reference to Santa Monica College’s website 
 and Career Services Central. 
 University High School - No established program; piloting alumni support for career services. 
 Venice High School - partners with local businesses; uses “First Break - LAUSD” list for job opportunities. Limited career services program. 
  
 The PCHS unique modular program would be solely devoted to career services through educational workshops, workforce fairs, a web-based portal of vast and meaningful employment and internship listings established specifically for high school students, and a physical site that is innovative in design to welcome students and community partners. In addition to similar High School Career Centers, student job and internship placement, and networking opportunities will have high priority in the career services center and will be made possible through extensive networking with local organizations and businesses by our Career Consultant. Students will gain an understanding of where and how their job or internship fits within the career clusters used by the CA department of education, community colleges, universities, and labor agencies. We hope to build a model program that can be replicated by other high schools across LA for further development.","PCHS will build on our existing relationships with local businesses, local community organizations and civic leadership to develop our project. We enjoy a highly productive and engaging relationship with all of these groups and have received widespread support for the project already.
 
 Specifically, PCHS will be working directly with local business leaders for job placement during the school year and holiday breaks. These include businesses in the following key industries: retail, healthcare, entertainment, technology and the sciences. 
 
 We will be working with the following community organizations on our project: Pacific Palisades Branch of the LA County Library, Pacific Palisades Womens’ Club; the Optimist Club; and the American Legion. All of these organizations are long-time supporters of PCHS and will be able to offer their resources to expand the program. 
 
 Our Alumni Network, local Chamber of Commerce, Palisades Charter Complex Leadership, and the YMCA (Pacific Palisades Branch) will be working in collaboration with PCHS to socialize the program rapidly so that it can spread across the entire city. The Project does not provide for the sharing of any funds directly with any of these organizations; however, the purpose of the Project is wholly consistent with the mission of our collaborators, which will ensure a successful engagement.","$100,000
 
 Establish a web-based portal for employment, internship, and networking opportunities. Employers, local organizations, and local government agencies will post opportunities to website tailored for PCHS. Students can search opportunities, and post resumes & portfolios for employers. Students may schedule interviews for jobs, internships, and develop a network of career professionals. In addition, the existing software program used for college counseling will be upgraded to include a curriculum course component to tie in PCHS’ curriculum to the student’s college & career choice.
 
 Purchase five Macbooks, a laser printer, and related supplies to provide students with access to the web-based portal, and other electronic research tools in the Career Services Center. Students can conduct research for jobs and work on resumes and cover letters in a welcoming center that fosters learning.

We believe increasing demand is a mark of success and will be met with the infrastructure built into the educational curriculum and implementation of the proposed technology programs.
 
 On a broader scale, it is the goal that the PCHS Career Service Center becomes the role model for other Los Angeles based high schools and local industries. We feel that this collaborative approach, presented in a manner which is age appropriate to high school students, can be easily replicated and beneficial to all involved stakeholders. The incorporation of career planning skills into high school curriculum is something that can be shared with the greater Los Angeles community to the benefit of all Los Angeles public high school students. 
 
 The project success will be scaled across the City of Los Angeles at other high schools through sharing our best practices for software applications, communications with students, parents and employers, and educational tools to prepare students for exposure to the workforce. At PCHS we are committed to a high quality public education experience and the vision of the high school campus as a center for learning inside and outside the classroom. As such, we will be sharing our learned expertise, to replicate the program at other public high schools. We believe that this program can be established economically elsewhere.
 
 Our goal is to have the students, parents and counselors work as a team to guide our students towards becoming college and career ready by utilizing the tools provided to them with the goal of embracing their own future with knowledge and confidence."

This initiative is action-oriented, builds public involvement, focuses on a root cause of our environmental/health crises, and partner’s school gardens with our farmers market and community gardens to address the lack of stable school garden programs",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,"The Urban Garden Network has six interconnected urban open space gardens: two parklets, a community garden on Motor Ave. and three local school gardens at Palms Elementary, Palms Middle School, and Overland Elementary.",ALL,"One of the proudest achievements of MAIA has been the opening of a Sunday’s Farmers Market at the corner of Motor Ave. and National Boulevard. This public outdoor neighborhood space provides our community with access to fresh locally grown fruits and vegetables, prepared foods, crafts, nutrition edu- cation, yoga, children’s activities, live music and more.
 
 MAIA is located in the middle of a food desert, meaning that residents have little to no access to affordable, organically grown healthy fruits and vegetables. In an effort to combat this serious issue that affects many marginalized communities, the Farmers’ Market provide residents with more affordable access to healthy food. The benefits of urban gardening is key in creating change and promoting healthier and equitable food choices, which is why the Urban Garden Network was developed as a perfect compliment to the Farmer’s Market.
 
 Urban Garden Network:
 Expanding on our interest in health education, recreational open space, and community building, MAIA developed the Urban Garden Network. This expansion allows us to not only give community members access to organic and healthy produce, but also educate our participants about the benefits and joys of growing their own produce through the use of urban gardens. By having students participate in these gardens, we have the opportunity to show them that learning does not exclusively happen in the classroom and, if they engage themselves, they can learn outdoors in nature.
 
 The Urban Garden Network has six interconnected urban open space gardens: two parklets, a community garden on Motor Ave. and three local school gardens at Palms Elementary, Palms Middle School, and Overland Elementary. With the support of local officials, corporations, foundations and dedicated community members, our gardens are bringing joy and education to Palms residents. We are also equipping the gardens with new fruit and vegetable seeds and seedlings, planter boxes, tools, decomposed granite paths, shaded teaching areas, additional seating, a secure storage sheds, designated compost areas, and expanded drip irrigation.","As with many school gardens, there are periods of time when the garden goes fallow due to breaks or when a founding teacher or parent leaves. As a result, we developed an interconnected network to ensure the gardens are properly maintained: participants of the urban gardens help tend to the school plots throughout the year and during spring, summer, fall and winter breaks. The students and community share responsibility for all the gardens and thus develop a sense of ownership for all gardens and for their community, while making sure these gardens do not suffer when students are unable to actively care for them.","In analyzing the success of our program, we will conduct pre and post tests with students on curriculum using the open space community gardens as an instructive tool as well as testing students on garden knowledge. Our intention in teaching multiple subjects via gardening is to increase the engagement and enthusiasm for knowledge that aids in data retention. Analysis will include comparing exam scores with those of previous years before the gardens were implemented. Objectives are also measured in terms of numbers and ages of participants, both at schools and at community garden plots. And lastly, we measure the production levels and quality of produce, just like any other farm.","Our urban garden network is unique to other urban garden organizations due to it's interconnected nature that incorporates the whole community, i.e., supporters, community members, schools (faculty, staff, students, parents), garden plot owners, leaders. Our mission is to advance this multiple, or unified garden program in order to instill an environmental stewardship within the community as well as encourage such interconnected relationships.","Currently we hold three partnerships with three local schools and LAUSD, The County of Los Angeles, Thee City of Los Angeles,And corporations like LaVictoria, and other corps . Our partnerships ensure our supported responsibility of each partner's school gardens. We will grant appropriate money to our schools in order to improve and advance our current garden spaces to meet California drought conditions (through current technological innovations) as well achieve a safe,sustainable, and fun place that encourages the growth of our students. All monies go directly to the gardens.","MAIA is in need of this proper funding in order to complete our network. We are in the final stages of development of the network.

5102227,PANDO HUBS,2015150,,; World Studio Foundation: 133776523,"The intention of this proposal is to transform Los Angeles by identifying and networking its existing hubs of ecological civilization – places where healthy living and education extends to social relations and the biosphere. This pilot grant will allow us to take a series of small, bold moves in nurturing relationships among the hubs, and to develop plans for our next step, to create and support new centers of ecological living, work and innovation. We call these places Pando Hubs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"This is a 9-mo. pilot project that lays the foundation for building ecological civilization in LA -- one urban hub at a time.
 
 We will identify a network of locations and orgs throughout LA where a new way of living is taking root; learn what makes these places of ecological innovation work; discover how best we can nurture their development, and apply what we learn to developing a plan for scaling growth.
 
 We call these places Pando Hubs. “Pando” is the name of the oldest and largest life form on the planet -- a massive aspen grove connected by a single root, with every part nourishing the rest.
 
 There are lots of possible Pando Hub models. Perhaps an urban eco-village or intentional community. Environmental magnet school. Urban farm. Neighborhood vegan restaurant/supply chain. Eco-homeless shelter. Green incubator. Or a combination.
 
 Hubs are places that reflect an ecological worldview. Sites of innovation, resilience and community for a diverse range of people. Where life is being rethought from the ground up, with the planet’s health and the health of each other in mind. They bring bold ideas about the shape of the future down to Earth.
 
 LA already has places like this. But they often exist in isolation from each other. If they focus on different areas, they don’t necessarily recognize the connective tissue that runs between them. We do.
 
 Launching Pando Hubs, we will: 
 
 1) Identify and connect a network of already-existing locations of ecological civilization in LA -- businesses, services, NGOs.
 
 2) Understand and document the important features that make them work. Draft 3 case studies.
 
 3) Conceive small-bet opportunities tailored to help Hubs thrive – in terms of community, learning, and new development. 
 
 Small bets let us think wrong, be bold, invent, see what works. John Bielenberg leads our Blitz process to generate small-bet ideas, from testing pop-up Hub prototypes and events to transforming would-be Hubs into something greener/healthier to tech and social media ideas for connecting.
 
 4) Launch 5-7 small-bet Pando Hub initiatives based on a matrix of do-ability vs. impact. Network over social media. 
 
 5) Critically assess. Draw up next-step plans that build on success and create opportunities for further Hub development and growth.
 
 We aim to have Pando Hubs in every City Council district citywide. 
 
 We launch under City Councilmember Paul Koretz's campaign, “Decade: Climate Safe (2016-25).”","How do we get buy-in across diverse communities?
 
 We have pulled together a “Pando Corps” from our base to help us in this process. Our base draws from those who attended our inaugural conference at Pomona College in June 2015, focused on rethinking civilization along ecological lines (2,000 attendees, across 80 areas of specialty), as well as the groups that co-sponsored our press conference and rally at USC last month in support of the pope’s call for “integral ecology.” Many of these environmental, social justice, civic, business, interfaith and educational groups have joined with us to create Pando Hubs. We develop our work within this broad coalition of support.
 
 Many also recognize the value of linking a particular cause (say, obesity) to other issues (say, climate change or issues of equity) that, while connections may not be obvious at first, gives all groups strength. 
 
 Diverse groups have already expressed strong interest in becoming a Pando Hub.","Qualitatively, success means we will develop critical intelligence to foster a Hub network across LA where healthy food can be accessed, air pollution and carbon footprint levels are reduced, opportunities for green jobs arise and self-sufficiency increases, obesity, mental illness and addiction are addressed in more holistic ways, homeless people come to know less alienation, and living in closer relationship to LA-area plants and animals is valued.
 
 Quantitatively, we will:
 
 o ID and describe some 10-12 locations of ecological civilization in LA.
 o Write 3 case studies seeking to understand successful Hub models.
 o Assess small-bets success in nurturing Hub development and growth.
 o Develop detailed next-step plans based on above research and assessments. 
 o Create a workable next-steps plan.
 o Demonstrate concept buy-in over social media, including online conversations. 
 o Identify at least 10 opportunities for next-step funding from among a diverse range of funders.","Our overall orientation and roots offer us special opportunities:
 
 -- We have relations with many excellent environmental organizations in the city. But we likely hold a singular position in LA among those who are interested in the intersection of big ideas and the Earth. This emphasis allows us to link a broader diversity of subjects, people, and organizations than groups that focus on a single set of issues. Our inaugural conference in Claremont in June featured more than 80 fields of specialty exploring fundamental assumptions of culture, on behalf of the Earth. The relationship between broad, transdisciplinary subjects and the planet has been the main focus of our founding chairperson, John B. Cobb, Jr., since at least 1971. 
 
 --Many diverse faith-based organizations are also concerned about creating a healthier LA, broadly conceived. We are collaborating with a number of them, from major world religions to interfaith organizations to those of no faith tradition. Within Los Angeles, however, we have singular opportunities for deep interfaith relations. Our founding chairperson, at a very active 90 years of age, has unique standing in the field as one of the leading philosophers of religion alive today, in addition to pioneering the intersection of philosophy/religion, ethics, and the environment. 
 
 --Educational institutions also are interested in a healthier and environmentally stronger Los Angeles, with UCLA as one example among many. The focus of great research institutions, however, tends to be highly specialized. Our focus is very broad, such that a healthy life cannot be understood without reference to economics, philosophy, urban planning and environmental policy as well as to biology, medicine, psychology, and on.
 
 --Within the art and design community, excellent organizations are taking advantage of LA’s forward-edge position and creating pioneering efforts in the design-for-good movement with a holistic vision in mind. GOOD Magazine is a wonderful example. The art and design team affiliated with Pando Populus, headed by John Bielenberg, has also long been involved in design for good, with Project M as one example. Tucker Nichols, formerly artist-in-residence at Facebook, is an example of one with whom we collaborated recently in developing images for branding and social media. World Studio Foundation has a strong track record in national programs as well.","PROGRAM PARTNERS are those which, in addition to the Applicants and their staff, will be conducting program work.

 The next stage of significant growth will be achieved as we create development models that respond to the most promising range of funding opportunities. These funding opportunities likely include a full range of for-profit, non-profit, and government sources. 
 
 One model of a Pando Hub, for instance, might appeal to millennials interested in an urban intentional community; another might offer a low-cost veteran housing solution; another might function more as an urban farm and organic food-producing center. The examples are less important than the fact that each likely offers the opportunity for a different kind of funding structure and/or different model of ownership. The top tier opportunities (assessed according to feasibility and need) will be developed and tested in further pilot projects.
 
 Eventually, Pando Hubs will scale on a franchise model of growth, by which we would provide the branding, a planbook(s) for implementation, and a specialist network."
5102229,Parents Education League of LA: Creating Your Go-To School Resource & Parent Network,2016162,,,"Imagine a city with informed and confident parents who understand the school landscape, are actively involved and can make the best possible educational choices for their children. 
 
 To serve the greatest number of families possible, PEL proposes to expand our website to 
 1) offer comprehensive and robust access to school and educational resources via live streaming, mobile application, webinars, an interactive map; &
 2) develop and activate a City-Wide Network of parents and educational leaders",1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"Imagine an LA where discussions of schools and education are met with excitement and possibility rather than anxiety and discord. 
 
 Imagine a “one-stop” Website and Mobile App where parents can easily access and learn about the importance of early childhood education, the differences between public and private schools, and enrichment resources. PEL will create a robust Website and Mobile App, hosting videos of our programming & speakers. With the advanced technology, we can replicate our existing programming to reach thousands more parents. PEL frequently hosts speakers on hot topics such as: separation anxiety for new preschoolers, promote vocabulary growth, tech for tots, kindergarten readiness, reading strategies, learning styles & differences, dyslexia, gifted education, progressive education, homeschooling, and arts as enrichment.
 
 Imagine a “go-to” mapped presentation of LA’s schools and educational choices without advertising or bias. PEL will host and feature a more visually engaging and interactive geographical map that outlines all options from a managed database.
 
 Imagine informed parents connected through a City-Wide Parents Network, representing schools from all sectors of the educational landscape so they can virtually connect. PEL will develop and activate a parent portal for access to relevant information.
 
 PEL is positioned to reach the above goals as we currently offer live programming to over 500 families a year in collaboration with over 200 preschools, over 50 independent schools, over 50 educational resource providers, the Office of School Choice of LAUSD, and the California Charter Schools Association. 
 
 With new website capabilities of online programming combined with a robust Parent Network, we can geographically reach an almost unlimited number of families throughout LA County. Specifically, we can expand to include the Downtown LA/Los Feliz/South Los Angeles areas. 
 
 Our success would be measured by reaching as many families of the approximately 55,000 children entering Preschool or Kindergarten every year in LA. With Google Analytics we can specifically analyze who we are reaching & where. Data collected can also indicate which type of programming parents are most interested in accessing. Email addresses will be collected on the site to request subjective feedback.
 
 Specifically, PEL’s goal is to reach 1,500 new parents during the initial 90 days, 4,000 by the 6th month, & 12,000 by year end & maintain consistently high ratings.","We can anticipate some challenge with outreach and with populating the database. While our membership and visibility are strong in many parts of the city, we will create a targeted outreach strategy to areas of the city in which we have not yet worked. Our strategy includes site visits to local parent groups and school PTA’s; use of targeted and wide-scale social media; continued use of written press releases to printed publications & radio stations; and creatively utilizing PEL’s $10,000/month Google AdWords Grant. 
 
 We can anticipate some challenge with populating the school & resource database; specifically inclusion and proper identification. This requires an understanding of all sectors of the school world & parent leader involvement. Our strategy includes utilizing our Board’s resources, connections within the educational community, creating a timeline of goals, and tapping additional educational leaders and organizations (within LAUSD, CCSAD, ESAD, CCSA, CAIS) as advisors.","PEL’s proposal is unique in that we can determine how many people we have helped as well as the quality of the programming. 
 
 For subjective feedback, PEL will e-survey all recipients of live and streamed programming with a 3-point grading system. Each program will be evaluated by parents for quality and “take-away” merits. Follow-up e-surveys will be scheduled at six month and year intervals to determine parents’ continued satisfaction and/or value-added results. Demographic information will be incorporated into the survey to determine populations most served. A “comment and feedback” button on Website will provide for additional testimonials.
 
 For a more objective evaluation, the PEL Website/Application traffic is tracked with Google Analytics, including number of users, basic demographic info, and most demanded landing pages. With this data, PEL will strategize and respond to the community’s needs. The City-Wide Parent Network can be evaluated by its growth in schools represented.","Finding the right school and educational resources takes more than a hit-or-miss online search. There are for-profit ventures and online blogs that have a select degree of school information available:
 
 Greatschools is a national website with substantial advertising (www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/) 
 Los Angeles TImes has a page for all California schools K-12 (schools.latimes.com/)
 Zillow has an interactive map with K-12 schools using Greatschools ratings. www.zillow.com/los-angeles-ca/schools
 
 Specific to Early Childhood Education, LAUP offers information to families about public preschool choices. The Independent School Alliance works with multiracial families interested in the independent schools. 
 
 PEL is unique in its mission and purpose: our purpose is to provide access to information about all school options (preschool-grade 12) and educational opportunities so families can make the most appropriate choices for their children. PEL is a timely, unbiased, objective and ultimately comprehensive resource for families. We are the only non-profit organization in Los Angeles that reaches out to parents, schools and educational resources and offers a platform of collaboration. Lastly, PEL relies on the generosity of its supporters and donors and not on advertisement. 
 
 PEL believes families in LA have a great deal of choice when exploring schools and educational opportunities for their children. It’s access to these choices in a clear, concise and understandable manner that is often lacking. Parents deserve this access. Armed with access and information, families can make the best choices for their children--and finding the right fit for schooling has proven long-term results. Student success, self-confidence, as well as parent’s confidence in their child’s school and teachers are all critical results of finding and attending the best fitting school for each family.
 
 Our collaborations with the various educational sectors of this county, including LAUSD, CCSA, ESAD and CCSAD, have greatly increased parent awareness. In addition, our past programming reflects this commitment to access: 
 
 LA Preschool Fair, Multilingual Education Fair, Education and Enrichment Fair, Preschool Workshop, Preschool Admissions Panel, Private School Admissions Panel, Charter & Magnet Presentation, and Summer Camp Fair.","We have a website proposal from Fireman Creative, a family-centric website developer in Pittsburgh, PA. Fireman creative has developed similar websites and applications in other cities such as San Francisco http://firemancreative.com/work/parents-place/. They will receive approximately $36,000 of the grant.","PEL will keep our Proposal within the $100,000 budget. The Website and Mobile Application will cost approximately $30,000 to develop as noted above. The annual site maintenance is $6,000. In addition, staff is budgeted at $25,000. $20,000 is allocated for programming & production. The outreach will cost approximately $14,000 and overhead will be limited to $5,000.

 Total $100,000","Pathways to scale PEL’s success depend on a) providing a continued valuable resource and b) growing the number of parents served. The more parents we reach and serve well, the more valuable PEL becomes as a network of information. 
 
 PEL’s budget is extremely lean, and yet we have made great strides in 5 years. Parents are extremely receptive and have seen the value in our programming. Via the proposed technology and parent networks, PEL can reach exponentially more parents. With this foothold of recognition and awareness, PEL will achieve an economy of scale to insure stability and viability as an organization. The benefits of the initial investment in the Website and Application will continue long after the initial 12 months, thus compounding the return on investment for multiple years. 
 
 With this infrastructure in place, PEL ultimately aims to replicate this model for the larger counties in California and expand statewide with the support of Regional and State organizations and local PTA Chapters. In addition, we will continue to partner and collaborate with other non-profit organizations & for-profit affiliates who can help fulfill our mission.
 
 Note: PEL’s current Affiliate Membership is available to for-profit resource providers and consists of a $95 tax-deductible donation/year. While PEL does not & will not advertise on its website, we do recognize these generous donors. Also, with a larger subscriber database, we are able to secure more corporate sponsorships for our events. These proceeds will allow us to hire additional staff to manage more programming and outreach. 
 
 Parent Testimonials:
 Education & Enrichment Resource Fair:
 “I loved the speakers, mostly the keynote speakers. At something like this, it is nice to know you are not alone. Sometimes you feel you are the only one that has kid with issues and it's nice to see other moms doing what they can to help their children. It was nice to have various services all at one place. It was my first year going and I thought it was great.”
 
 Kindergarten Panel:
 “The program was well organized & worthwhile. The moderator did a really good job. That isn't always easy, nor is handling a roomful of anxious parents, so just wanted to say ""thanks!""
 
 Preschool Fair:
 “I'm a new mom and this was very helpful because some of the preschools I didn't find in my search on yelp, google search, & in the book. It was wonderful to be able to ask questions to multiple schools. Please keep having the fairs.”"
5102232,People for Parks’ Community School Parks,2018095,,,"People for Parks (PFP) will open six new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours. LAUSD youth enrichment specialists will offer diverse programming with emphases on play, physical activity, nutrition, outdoor learning and community building. Use of school playgrounds as park space is a creative, efficient, inexpensive way to provide a park within walking distance of LA residents. Community mobilization by PFP and parent participation will keep these spaces sustainable.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,Berendo Middle School in Central LA/Pico Union; Leo Politi Elementary School (ES) in Central LA/Pico Union; Gratts ES in Central LA/Westlake; Esperanza ES in Central LA/Westlake; 20th St ES in South LA/Central Alameda; Main St ES in South LA/South Park,ALL,"People for Parks works towards the day when all Angelenos can walk to a park. As part of this effort, we will open six Community School Parks in LA in 2016 and empower parents and community members to participate in park activity and sustainability so that these spaces thrive for years to come. 
 
 Community School Parks (CSPs) are supervised school-site playgrounds that are open to the public on weekends, holidays and summers and feature dynamic programming carried out by school staff. 
 
 In 2012, PFP tore up asphalt, replaced it with grassy fields and tracks and opened life-changing CSPs at Vine and Trinity Street Elementary schools. Using the formerly closed school sites as space for physical activity has led to healthier living, better nutrition, family and community strengthening, documented improvements in academics and reduction in obesity. They also helped families feel safer about playing in the neighborhood, as school principals confirmed major drops in vandalism and other signs of trouble. 
 
 90% of youth in Boston and New York live within 1/4 mile of a park compared with 33% of LA children. The LA Unified School District is the second largest landowner in LA. Unlocking its school playgrounds on weekends brings parks to underserved communities, where parents are overworked and 86% of children are eligible for free/reduced lunches; 72% are Hispanic/Latino.
 
 Opening six new Community School Parks means 25,000-30,000 more Angelenos will have access to a safe park 1/4 mile or less from home. Once afraid to go outside in areas with the highest reported percentages of gang activity, children and families will enjoy park time at their own school campus surrounded by friends and staff. 
 
 Residents will discover a vibrant park and enjoy programming run by dedicated specialists. Activities include organized sports, fitness exercises, intergenerational activities, art/crafts, storytelling, outdoor learning, gardening, ecology and multi-cultural events. Baseball clinics and other team-building activities held at the parks by our newest partner, the LA Dodgers, are in the planning phases.
 
 Community members will also receive training and support on park programming, maintenance and shared use through our Incubator, which helps ensure CSP sustainability and scalability.
 
 One parent says it all-- The park staff members lovingly assist our kids with crafts, sports and other physical fitness games and also keep the area secure for our entire family.”","Opening six Community School Parks in a year is an extensive undertaking. We have the proven blueprint but need more manpower. We will hire two community organizers who, along with board members and current staff, will engage residents, train volunteers and coordinate the opening and programming of our new parks.
 
 People for Parks’ Community School Parks project includes mobilizing parents and other school community members to participate in park programming, upkeep and shared use facilitation. We realize, however, that community availability depends on family responsibilities, work schedules and language concerns. PFP faces this challenge by taking the community’s lead in assessing how best to participate. In some cases, this means providing resources for parents to garden at school parks. In others, it means creating CSP councils or coordinating canvasing activities. Learning from community members about the sustainability strategies that work best for them will ensure success.","The first marker of success will be the opening of six Community School Parks. Park use statistics by LAUSD enrichment staff will evaluate the goal that each park serves at least 300-500 patrons per month for recreation and 500+ for special events. 
 
 Scores from LAUSD’s Physical Fitness Summary, statewide 5th grade obesity testing and academic scores will help us evaluate the quality and vibrancy of parks.
 
 Surveys, youth enrichment assessments and interviews with school staff, parents, children and community members will also help us grade park effectiveness and impact on LA2050 dream metrics--park access, vibrancy, crime reduction, feeling safe in neighborhoods, intergenerational play, numbers in afterschool programs, quality of informal spaces--as well as fitness, health and community building. 
 
 General data from and consultation with the LA County Dept. of Public Health ‘Joint Use Moving People to Play’ task force will be used by PFP to maintain the quality of evaluations.","People for Parks (PFP) is currently the only organization actively opening LAUSD school playgrounds as parks that offer supervised play and programming for the community on weekends, holidays and summers. 
 
 What makes us unique is a) the scale at which we are engaged in transforming LAUSD school playgrounds into parks; b) our fast track permit process, allowing schools to join People for Parks’ existing service agreement with LAUSD; c) the youth enrichment programming offered at parks during non-school hours and d) the trainings and toolkits provided for residents, parents and school staff to take on greater roles in CSP management so as to ensure sustainability, minimize future operating costs and strengthen each school community. 
 
 People for Parks is aware of and linked with several groups that are doing complementary work focused on greening, restoring or expanding existing city parks, or purchasing property and building new parks. These organizations include The Trust for Public Land, the Hollywood/LA Beautification Team, The Neighborhood Land Trust, Tree People, Muir Ranch, Koreatown Youth and Community Center and the LA Parks Foundation. PFP remains in contact with these groups regarding possible partnerships and looks forward to engaging with others.
 
 As members of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health “Joint Use Moving People to Play” (JUMPP) task force, PFP is also in contact with organizations dedicated to empowering kids and adults to be more physically active by expanding joint or shared use recreation facilities. These groups offer community access arrangements, but not at our current scale or service area. PFP consults with JUMPP on our current Community School Parks project and looks forward to collaborating more extensively with JUMPP partners on future projects. 
 
 PFP is also aware of several community groups such as the Wonderland School PTA and Brentwood Green, whose co-founder is PFP’s current president. They use individual contributions, community fundraisers and grants to gain access to their school playgrounds and offer programming during non-school hours. Each of these groups is located in affluent communities so their strategies are not fully applicable to the sites PFP would open using LA2050 funds. Their approaches are nevertheless sources of inspiration and through partnership and consultation can inform how community groups at our six proposed sites can play active roles in park sustainability.","Our primary collaboration is with LAUSD, and more specifically Beyond the Bell (BTB), which is the district’s after school youth enrichment arm. We have enjoyed working with BTB since 2012. As detailed in our budget below, BTB staff will unlock school playgrounds and provide supervision and programming at six schools every Saturday or Sunday for one full year. LAUSD custodians will provide basic maintenance and bathroom upkeep, where applicable. The total amount charged for these services per park is $5,700, which comes to $34,200 for all six schools. This would make up approximately 34% of the grant funds.
 
 The Community School Parks model has also brought together diverse agency partners to collaborate on long-term solutions in support of community access to school sites for public recreation. We will continue corresponding with these partners as we carry out the grant, should we receive it. None of these partners would receive portions of our LA2050 grant.
 
 The LA Promise Zone project is one of ten federal anti-poverty “promise” initiatives in the US dedicated to making under-resourced communities more livable. A crucial part of this mission is expanding park space and turning schools into community hubs. The LA Promise Zone covers sections of Hollywood, Koreatown and Pico Union. As Promise Zone partners, People for Parks receives technical support from the L.A. Promise Zone network. This ranges from strategizing with other Promise Zone partners on executing project goals to assistance with federal grants. 
  
 LA’s County Department of Public Health “Joint Use Moving People to Play” (JUMPP) is dedicated to empowering kids and adults to be more physically active by expanding joint or shared use recreational opportunities. As members of the JUMPP task force, People for Parks will receive consulting assistance on data evaluation and community training, especially as it concerns making the language around joint/shared use more accessible to the general public.
 
 Other partners include the L.A. Department of Parks and Recreation, the L.A. Mayor’s Office, the Trust for Public Land, the Hollywood/LA Beautification Team, Tree People, the Koreatown Youth and Community Center, the LA Dodgers, Big Sunday, Muir Ranch, Enrich LA, various LA neighborhood councils as well as parent and volunteer groups.","People for Parks estimates that it will be able to open six Community School Parks with the $100,000 grant from LA2050.","2016 People for Parks Community School Parks LA2050 Project Budget:

PFP has started this process by identifying 20 partially greened schoolyards that are locked off from their communities. We conducted needs assessments based on school and community feedback and local park accessibility. These sites are ready to be opened, but require shared use agreements and funding for park supervision/programming. 
 
 The first six schools in this group are those listed on this grant. As such, the LA2050 grant would be part of our move to scale up. 
 
 The tools we use to ensure a) the sustainability of these six parks and b) the scalability of our Community School Parks project (so that we can open additional parks) are administered through our Community School Parks Incubator.
 
 People for Parks’ CSP Incubator is a community-driven empowerment strategy that equips parents, school staff and neighbors with the resources needed to oversee existing CSPs and form new ones. PFP provides communities with funding, materials and trainings on park maintenance, programming, shared use policy, CSP wellness council coordination and an interactive website developed by PFP. We also offer communities the option to join our current service agreement with LAUSD, which provides programming, supervision and shared use access. The work is undertaken by the People for Parks CSP Incubator committee, community organizers, parents, former LAUSD facilities staff, and parkland use experts.
 
 Community School Parks Incubator trainings and toolkit also include:
 o Joint/Shared Use: Education on what entails and how it positively impacts schools and neighborhoods. 
 o Parent Involvement: Following the lead of and supporting parents in leadership roles in park activities such as gardening, park maintenance, activities club formation, and canvassing for local support. At Berendo, for example, we will provide greening assistance for a group of parents eager to enhance gardens in the schools’ grassy play spaces. Doing so will increase park vibrancy, attracting additional community involvement and support.
 o Civic Engagement: Engaging parents, teachers and stakeholders to elevate community voice in Community School Park formation/maintenance. Organizing participation in key neighborhood, city and district policy meetings. 
 o Fundraising:Training and assistance for community members seeking funds for ongoing park activity. Includes assistance requesting funds from the county, city and neighborhood councils."
5102085,Pioneer the Dreams and Aspirations of Youth & Artists in South Los Angeles,2015052,,,"Every year, the dreams and aspirations of many youth living in Los Angeles wanting to express their artistic talents come to a screeching halt due to a lack of creative outlets. According to the South LA Work Source Center, 4 out of 10 under privileged youth between the ages of 16-24 years old seek work experience and interest in the creative/art profession. As Otis College of Art and Design Alumni, we recognize the void and plan to fulfill it through an established community engaged art house.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,Learn,"Our “Artist Run Space” aims to respond to the lack of opportunity, by magnifying these artists’ works. Our project provides a platform for young artists to show their creations while networking with people in the creative circuit. 
 
 Another aspect of our mission is to increase involvement between artists and the community through community engagements, collaboration and mentorship with local elementary students. We propose creating a well-rounded organization that creates opportunities for new artists, discovers new talent from local youths, as well as generates successful fundraising events to provide for underprivileged families in the area during the holiday season. 
 
 The first event that launched Dreamhaus was its annual Toy Drive Benefit on December 13th, 2014, an event that served students at Saturn Elementary School by gifting toys during Christmas season. In addition, the benefit included a concert in collaboration with The OPM Company and Dom Kennedy. The event was open to the public and attendees were asked to either pay a $10 donation or donate a toy of at least that same value. We had over 400 attendees who came to support our cause and the event was deemed a success. In Toy Drive Benefits to come, the students who receive the toys will be mentored and collaborate with artists who participate in the Artist-Run Space to build out installations for viewing at the Toy Drive event. The Dreamhaus mission will come full circle by artists gaining experience in hosting successful gallery shows, exposing young students to a career in the arts and developing a deeper sense of community in the District 9 area.","One major barrier Dreamhaus will face is the issue of connecting the artistic and the local community. The “Artist Run Space” inhabits the 90037 zip code in the District 9 area. The ever-changing neighborhood of USC and Exposition Park serves as a prime example of wealth disparity in the community and exemplifies the visual image of Los Angeles. Dreamhaus aims to unite fine art and folk art by utilizing our storefront window, which faces Vermont Avenue right across from the LA Coliseum. To have commissioned art installations in our storefront window will be a perfect way to interface with the community and demonstrate our artistic mission. A second challenge that Dreamhaus will face is the collaboration between young children and artists. To overcome this obstacle, Dreamhaus will sponsor programs that enable artists to give back to the community by teaching art workshops at local partnering schools within our neighborhood.","Dreamhaus will foster an educational & artistic platform by accomplishing the following goals:
 (1) Showcase 20 artists; new in the professional art circuit, to help them gain experience and build their CV. These artists will have the opportunity to communicate their vision on an open forum artist discussion, showcase their artworks for a month in the Dreamhaus space, and leave with a physical catalogue that can be utilized in advancing their careers outside of Dreamhaus.
 (2) We will Track the number of attendees for every event. Our current (250) person core audience will increase 15-20% each quarter, reaching an audience of 400-450 by the end of the year.
 (3) 12 workshops that cultivate a core group of 10 kids into realizing the possibilities of art as a career. We will focus on their specific and unique ideas to help them establish a body of artwork for their art career.
 (4) Ensure 640 kids receive at least 5 donated gifts for the Christmas season.","SPARC, also known as Social and Public Art Resource Center, is an organization that focuses on educating at-risk youth, and is complementary to Dreamhaus and its mission. Its work focuses on community engagement to provide empowerment to the residents of the neighborhood outside of civic debate. While SPARC focuses on the significance of the process in creating the artwork, Dreamhaus intends on measuring the value of the work based on its relativity to the neighborhood. However, both programs show the significant transformative impact that art can have on the important social problems of our generation.
 
 
 Another organization that does similar work is Elephant Gallery in Glassell Park, CA. This organization is also an “Artist-Run Space” and allows artists to submit proposals, yet they do not have any community-related projects. Elephant Gallery solely presents a platform where artists can showcase their work, however Dreamhaus integrates the surrounding neighborhood with the artists’ vision. Our organization is unique because we believe that we can make a change within the South Los Angeles community by transforming the way the public perceives the career of an artist and to motivate young students who are interested in technical or conceptual arts to pursue a professional art career.","Collaboration bridges common goals between separate entities. The OPM Company is a successful independent record company dedicated to giving a platform to aspiring musicians. Dom Kennedy, a Los Angeles-born rapper, is an advocate for Dreamhaus and is a partner. In addition, Pacific Dissent is a local, Los Angeles-based contemporary art magazine that features photographers, painters, and writers from around the globe. Their publication is a platform that allows artists to be discovered in cities such as Los Angeles and New York. In this way, Pacific Dissent is a magazine version of what Dreamhaus aspires to be. Both companies hope to shape the future perception of artists, and uncover unprecedented artistic talent. 
 
 Both partner organizations will gain benefit of this grant through the renovated space and its artists. Dreamhaus, The OPM Company and Pacific Dissent will all share resources and create opportunities by opening the doors to innovative and risk-taking individuals willing to push boundaries as we (together) shape Los Angeles to become the best place to learn, create, connect and live.","The Dreamhaus project budget is $106,400. The $6,400 additional costs will be covered through other means, namely donations, sponsorship and rental of the Dreamhaus warehouse. 
 
 One feature of our budget is allocated for materials to be used for the workshop with elementary school students. It will include painting materials such as paper, paint and brushes. Organizations such as Blick Art Materials have an online website dedicated to fundraising supplies for art programs. Dreamhaus will be using this fundraising operation in order to compensate for the additional cost that will not be covered in the funding provided by LA2050. 
 
 We have established a network of rental clients that include Interscope Records/Universal Music Group, The Top Shelf Company, and Atlantic Records.

 Total $106,400.00","Since our proposal outlines our mission to construct an “Artist-Run Space,” the first method of scaling success would be simply having a fully-functional facility, one that houses art events. Moreover, by sustaining a consistent schedule of artist showcases in our studio, our effect can be measured. The projected start date for renovations to the studio will be January 2016. Meanwhile, we will be reviewing proposals of artists with art collections that are ready to show. These candidates will have the opportunity to explain their concept, and, in addition, they will commit to leading a month-long workshop in alignment with the Dreamhaus mission to establish community engagement between artists and youth. As we reach the six-month mark, we hope to discuss the possibility of opening up the studio to displaying two artists per month in order to maintain a level of productivity in the organization. By slowly expanding the operation in this natural fashion, and growing our number of art events consistently (to compete with schedules of certain reputable museums), scaling will be self-evident.
 
 Another phase of our plan to measure the success of our proposal is the work we will do with elementary school students. Our co-founders have a history of working with Saturn Elementary School and we would like to expand our work by holding art workshops for small groups of students. We believe that involving a younger generation of students in learning about technical and conceptual art skills will better acclimate them with their studies in school. To give an example- in a classroom setting, we will limit students to a specific color palette where they will be instructed to create an abstract piece. Once they are finished, we will ask them to explain their thought process and the reasoning behind their creation. We will scale the success by knowing that the children have a strong grasp on conscious decision-making in the art marking process. Our hope is to help students realize the connection between their imagination and their success in everyday classroom setting (and beyond). 
 
 Finally, back to the “Artist Run Space,” we hope that in five years time, Dreamhaus will be a point of reference for corporations to connect with artists. Funding from this grant challenge will allow us to work towards a better Los Angeles as a place to create, connect and live."
5102006,Play for Life in South LA,2015002,,,"Through LA2050, APCH will help beautify our South Los Angeles neighborhood, improve fitness and wellbeing, expand opportunities for education, and encourage broader horizons and a sense of community by engaging all residents, young and old. APCH believes that your zip code should not define your future; through our innovative, wrap-around services we will provide thousands of children and families in the 90011 area with safe spaces to play and thrive.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"From its humble beginnings over 22 years ago, APCH has evolved from an afterschool drop-in program in the basement of a church to a community center representing 25,000 square feet, including an athletic field, commercial kitchen, garden and dance studio. We serve an annual average of 900 boys and girls from more than 100 elementary, middle and high schools in South Los Angeles.
 
 At APCH we believe that zip code should not determine a child’s future, so we offer a comprehensive array of free programs spanning academics, athletics, the arts, and more with the goal of enriching our members’ lives and helping them become excited to learn and grow. We propose to:
 
 Create Opportunities to Play - Our South Central neighborhood currently lacks safe places for children to play. Through our totally free programming and open membership process we create healthy avenues for activity and joy. We plan to expand the South Central Sports League, which we founded and currently facilitate. This League provides an opportunity for hundreds of youth from APCH and partner organizations to play competitive sports in a supportive environment completely free of charge. We also offer 125 enriching field trips throughout the year, including sailing camp, horseback riding, sporting events, and more.
 
 Expand Safe Places to Play- An important part of encouraging play and community is providing safe spaces for local residents to gather. APCH has already built two community gardens, in addition to our on-site garden, and will continue to expand by building a new, even larger garden over the coming year. Our vision is for a “Green Corridor” linking APCH, the Newton Division Police Station, and Jefferson High School. We will also increase the number of community clean ups we coordinate throughout the year (currently averaging six per year), helping to create a physically pleasing neighborhood that will inspire pride and active ownership. 
 
 Engage the Community in Change- For our plans to be successful, all community members must be aware of, equipped for, and able to participate in the opportunities available. By building on our existing relationships, APCH will generate awareness and participation in community change. This will be accomplished through parental education workshops held at APCH, regular stakeholder meetings, our annual community events including the Health & Garden Expo, and the distribution of nearly $1 million in groceries, toys, books, and more.","A constant problem is the high demand for our services. APCH serves over 900 unduplicated members per year and member retention has recently reached 90%. A high retention rate means that, by engaging youth semester after semester, year after year, we are able to have a deeper and more lasting impact. The downside to this is our ballooning wait-list; we currently have a waiting list of over 550 youth which translates to a 14 month wait period for most. 
 
 To address this challenge we have begun construction on a new Teen Center/Performing Arts Space, which will also be available upon request to other organizations in the community. We are also expanding our impact by taking leadership roles in multiple initiatives. From partnering with LAPD’s Newton division to plant gardens, to serving on the local Community-Police Advisory Board proving cultural awareness training, to driving Council District 9’s Great Streets initiative; APCH continues growing in our community.","We will monitor this proposal’s progress by tracking the number of community members taking advantage of our services and community spaces and through pre and post surveys given during the beginning and end of key projects and events. These surveys will gauge residents’ knowledge of local services and resources, satisfaction with our programs, as well as their perspectives on and involvement in the neighborhood. 
 
 All APCH youth members are also tracked through KidTrax, a performance measurement and participant management software designed specifically for youth-serving nonprofit organizations.","While there are agencies throughout Los Angeles that offer services focused on helping high- and at-risk youth to avoid challenges and realize their potentials, few of those agencies are community-integrated and none we know of offers the wide variety of programs that are delivered at APCH. Once a young person becomes a member of APCH, and benefits from a few of our programs, that individual is much more likely to respond positively to the additional exceptional opportunities APCH offers to create a brighter future. Because the age range we serve starts as young as eight, our programs have time to nourish and cultivate an individual through elementary, middle and high school and on to college. Through our partnership with the parents at APCH, we can work with a family to ensure they take full advantage of all of our programs and services, including free and comprehensive mental health counseling services. Through our holistic approach, we can address challenges and identify strengths early on and follow through with each and every one of our members as they progress. Our work has been recognized by organizations such as Charity Navigator; we have just received our 4th consecutive 4 star rating, which only 8% of organizations accomplish, and are the only 4 star rated afterschool program in South LA. 
 
 Our proposed approach is to make the high quality, free services available to APCH members available to more community residents. By engaging residents, creating public venues and increasing opportunities for play, APCH will transform South Central into a thriving community for all residents to enjoy.","A Place Called Home will be the sole executing agent, in charge of facilitating all programs and events, but will provide benefits to other community organizations by collaboration. For example, all partner organizations in the South Central Sports League will benefit as APCH staff currently administer the league.","We project an expected cost of $458,171.04. Additional costs will be covered by program specific and general operating funds. 
 
 APCH is in good fiscal health, including a 2-month Board-mandated operating reserve and an endowment, and maintains a strong cash flow, allowing us to accommodate any additional costs or unforeseen expenses. Each year we design and implement a strategic fundraising plan to ensure that all programmatic and organizational operations are sustained. Strategies for sustainability include growing the Board of Directors; executing a Capital Campaign to improve and expand our space; developing multi-year organizational budget projections; developing and executing a comprehensive Annual Giving plan; and developing and launching a communications strategy that supports our goals.
 
 When and if program-specific funds present a shortfall, APCH is able to draw from general operating funds raised through three annual fundraisers: our Gala for the Children; the GirlPower Awards Luncheon; and Stars & Strikes. We can also acquire additional unrestricted funds through our Annual Appeals and Newsletter, as well as from foundation, corporations, and major individual donors. 
 
 APCH’s strength in raising unrestricted funds in no way indicate a lack of need, rather it speaks to the growth of the agency as a whole, and the commitment to providing continually evolving services in areas that are traditionally harder to fund with restricted donations. Our budget and operation have grown over the past five years in direct response to the increasing demand for APCH’s programs and services.","Personnel- $300,894.13

Our Teen Program has grown significantly over the past several years; three years ago the average daily attendance was 35 members and today this has doubled to 80 members on average each day. During that time we have added four new staff who work with the teens, but the program is being run out of the same 800 square foot temporary bungalow the Teen Program has occupied for more than a decade. This space restriction has severely limited the program’s growth and membership. Enrollment in our general and teen membership is so high during the summer months that we are compelled to offer 3-4 field trips (ranging from 12-100 in attendance) per day so that our facilities do not become dangerously overcrowded. The new space will also serve as a performing arts center made available by request to other organizations in the community. This will allow us to host plays, concerts, and other performances and promote greater access to the arts. 
 
 We also plan to scale our impact through community partnerships, most notably the creation of new community gardens throughout our neighborhood. Additionally, we are in the process of codifying the APCH approach. APCH would like to further codify and standardize the gathering and tracking of data to identify and apply appropriate metrics in assessing and documenting acquisition and development of academic skills and rigor, attitudinal change, social competency, career aptitude, self-efficacy, and preparedness for transition to next levels of education, vocation and independence."

Our programming brings together the brightest, most successful, and socially motivated entrepreneurs and business executives. The connections forged through our programming benefit fledgling startups in the area. We facilitate collaboration that can generate new startups in South LA, inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles and making Los Angeles a stronger city overall. 
 
 South LA is at the physical edge of intense digital media, tech, and entrepreneurial activity. There are about 1,700 startups and digital media-focused companies within a four-mile radius just outside of — but not in — South LA. Same with dozens of incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces. Our area remains a tech desert. Our neighborhood didn’t make the top 10 highest funded startup neighborhoods list recently compiled by the online startup community Built in LA. Plug In will change this by infusing South LA with the programming and infrastructure needed to transform it into a viable place for startups. Our Digital and Beyond in LA series provides community education and awareness about the rapidly changing local economy within STEM sectors in the greater Los Angeles area, bringing water to the tech desert.","There is still a psychological barrier toward South LA as it is one of the most stigmatized areas in Los Angeles. We see our programming as an opportunity to change this and as a way to spark a new interest in tech and digital media among local youth. 
 
 One major challenge is attracting more leaders from outside of South LA to come here in order to demonstrate that South LA is a place where new ideas can be born. We are confident that this challenge is surmountable. Plug In South LA gives the country’s top innovators a compelling reason to be part of South LA’s transformation. It’s an opportunity to help us create an entirely new vibrant ecosystem through a pay it forward approach in mentoring and inspiring local youth to pursue entrepreneurship and careers in tech and digital media. .","We will measure the growth and progress of our member companies, including startups, as they scale up. One metric is how many internship opportunities they develop for local youth. Plug In South LA also has the ability to track the total number of local companies launching, local companies moving into the next round of funding as well as the number of local youth and residents pursuing opportunities in tech and digital media sectors. In addition, we can also evaluate our work through attendance at events hosted by the co-working space.","There are many co-working spaces, accelerators, and incubators in Los Angeles County, but we are the first planned for South LA. We are also unique because social entrepreneurship is part of our mission. Although Plug In South LA is a for-profit organization, we seek to have a positive impact the local community by stimulating economic activity that transforms the area. In addition to bringing tech and digital media to an underserved part of Los Angeles, Plug In South LA will facilitate mentorship for local students and youth organizations such as the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship.","Our partners are Verizon, General Assembly, LA Tech Digest, the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship in Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California but the entire grant would go directly into Plug In South LA.","We are estimating a total cost of around $350,000. We will cover the 
 additional costs through investors, memberships, sponsors, and

In addition, we plan to diversify our programing beyond tech and digital media to include areas such as financial literacy within an entrepreneurial context. Scaling up successfully for us also means offering workshops and events in more South LA neighborhoods such as Inglewood, Compton, Huntington Park, and South Gate. 
 
 Plug In South LA will catalyze the growth of its member companies and startups with its mentorship program and connections to venture capital. As Plug In South LA members become successful and hire more employees they will move out to larger dedicated office spaces in the surrounding community increasing economic activity.

5102318,Poetry is Life Poetry is Story,2015212,,,"The arts are a powerful means to heal, transform, and revitalize persons, families, communities, economies, political structures, and environments. We propose to offer 30 poetry/story workshops to multi-generational residents at libraries across L.A.. Within each of the 15 L.A. City Council districts there will be two 2-hour weekly workshops lasting 4 weeks, each culminating in a community open mic. Each district will feature one workshop for English speakers, and another for Spanish speakers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"Public libraries are a wonderful social invention, especially when they become dynamic centers for community, learning, reading, and connection. For the general public, and especially for neglected populations, these spaces are important for growing literacy and artistic capacities. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural is looking forward to conducting poetry workshops that tap into the unique life stories of patrons at as many as 30 of the 72 L.A.-area libraries. We will bring to life the poetic word, the story, the book through a series of workshops, each of which will culminate in Open Mic events. 
 
 Tia Chucha's proceeds from the Native American/Native Mexican philosophies that all people, all animals, the earth and the sky, are inexorably connected. For indigenous peoples everything is the arts (that's why there is no word for ""arts"" among most tribes). And all human beings have an inexhaustible, abundant and creative wellspring within that can be tapped into at any time.
 
 Poetry is one of the ecstatic arts for change and is being renewed by young people today through poetry slams, Hip Hop, publishing, and digital technology. This is happening at a time when poetry in the U.S. is being highly marginalized. Even in the world’s poorest countries, poetry is honored and publicly respected. But, in the U.S, the center of culture is mostly for entertainment and commercial value.
 
 Our “Poetry is Life, Poetry is Story” workshops will draw out the storehouse of stories within persons, families, communities to remember who we are, what are our relationships, and where we are going. Poetry means ""to make,"" to shape, to find beauty, just like the earth does constantly, after one understands the truth (science) and the good (morality)--a morality which is not imposed or for the control of others, but is based on how to properly interact with all beings, all genders, all so-called races, all nations, all tribes. 
 
 The artists we will involve in this important work appreciate the need people have to see and be seen, to hear and be heard, and to nurture these experiences to the fullest. Like water and bread, they feed hearts hungry for place and meaning through story and poetry. The workshops will allow our artist facilitators to inspire new artistic voices of all ages, encouraging them to share their stories and gifts with the public. In turn these instructors will be paid for their time and talents. This poetry workshop series is a win-win proposal for everyone.","One major challenge is the size of the city of L.A.-- 503 square miles. 
 
 Yet Luis J. Rodriguez, Tia Chucha's cofounder, has fostered poetry across the entire city. Appointed by Mayor Eric Garcetti as Poet Laureate of Los Angeles, Luis began his two year term in January 2015. Working closely with the LA Public Library and the city's Dept of Cultural Affairs, in the first six months of 2015 Luis did talks, read poetry or conducted writing workshops in some 70 events in libraries, schools, book fests, community festivals, graduations, and more, addressing around 10,000 people, and millions more through English and Spanish language media. 
 
 Our connections, beginning with Luis’s, will help us organize across the vast distance between libraries. And aside from Luis’s knowledge of the various libraries, we are in contact with a network of librarians and workshop facilitators equally anxious to bring poetry to this public venue. All assets will be used to overcome the barrier of distance.","For almost fifteen years Tia Chucha’s has been a beacon of cultural and literary inclusion in the NE San Fernando Valley. And while we have had visitors from as far away as Germany and Chile, our day-to-day reach has been primarily the local population. Our programs in Pacoima and occasional offsite booktables, student visits, and seasonal major events have also extended our reach.
 
 The library workshops are an opportunity to take our work to the next level, placing our programming and poet artists in neighborhoods which may have never experienced our unique offerings before. Our evaluations will include how many new people we have introduced to writing poetry, the size of the audiences that come to the culmination open mics at each site, and the poet teachers we are able to employ for these special workshops. All these elements will be part of measuring the impact of our efforts.","Thankfully, there are others in the city who also hold the power of poetry in high regard.
 
 One group stands out for their ability to draw from and give to the most marginalized populations through poetry. That organization is Street Poets, which works with inner-city youth through poetry expression. They organize reading events in various locations. They do recordings and workshops in schools and other community venues. They also have a performance van so that various poets can set up spontaneous (or organized) readings anywhere, anytime. 
 
 Get Lit Players and Say Word are also nonprofits that work in various schools to help young people memorize classic poems for performance, and also to create their own work. We do not see ourselves in competition with Get Lit Players, Say Word, Street Poets, and similar organizations. Rather, we see ourselves as complementing and extending this work further.
 
 Specifically, Tia Chucha's proposes to expand the scale of this poetry work to as many library locations as possible. What’s more, our unique efforts will go beyond primarily school-age youth. We will involve youth, teens, young adults, adults and elders--weaving the whole range of ages and experiences into a tapestry of stories through poetry that can help these varied generations see and hear each other in new ways through the magic of creative and courageous words. In addition, our workshops will be in both English and Spanish, which will break demographic barriers based on language. And we will of course employ diverse poetry artists in the process.
 
 What’s more, in March 2016, our Tia Chucha Press (which has published socially engaged cross-cultural poetry books for 27 years) will release the most comprehensive poetry anthology of LA-area poets in city history, ""Coiled Serpent: Poets Arising from the Cultural Quakes & Shifts of Los Angeles"". This new resource will be incorporated to display the poetic wealth of the city, and serve to encourage these new writers to continue developing their skills and telling their story.
 
 Tia Chucha’s will use poetry and story as a doorway for a more literate, reading and writing public. We are confident that such literacy can be a true reflection of personal and community authority and authenticity. We know this to be the case because we have seen it happen through our work.","We are happy to have the enthusiastic collaboration of amazing partners for this project. 
 
 As mentioned before, Luis J. Rodriguez, Tia Chucha's cofounder, award-winning author and the new Poet Laureate of L.A., is on board to help make this project a success. Again, his connections to the LA Public Library and the city's Department of Cultural Affairs will prove invaluable. His reach with huge numbers of people across the city will assist with publicity. And his knowledge of and relationship to poets and poetry will be of much use to this project. Tia Chucha’s poetry press will be a great asset as well.
 
 To further solidify connections to libraries in the city, we are pleased to have the support of the impressively energetic L.A. chapter of REFORMA for this project. Established in 1971 as an affiliate of the American Library Association (ALA), the national organization REFORMA actively seeks to promote the development of library collections to include Spanish-language and Latino oriented materials; the recruitment of more bilingual and bicultural library professionals and support staff; the development of library services and programs that meet the needs of the Latino community, and more. For their assistance in identifying and securing the libraries where the workshops will be conducted we have allocated $10,000 from the award to REFORMA LA.
  
 In addition, our relationship with the L.A. Poet Society will now extend to this project. This non-profit community organization works to create and bridge the creative community all over Los Angeles county and partner with literary LA. LAPS is extremely passionate about bringing literacy to underserved youth, joining efforts of bringing literary programming to diverse neighborhoods, and publishing the creatives of LA. They enjoy fiscal sponsorship through 100 Thousand Poets for Change, a global movement, uniting the world using art as a fundamental basis for peace, healing, and sustainability in all communities. We have allocated $45,000 for workshop instructors and facilitators with the majority of those funds going toward the instructors that L.A. Poet Society will be providing. 
 
 Beyond these partners, we look forward to incorporating a solid crew of poet artists who have proven their commitment to community and the arts through their years of voluntarily facilitating Tia Chucha’s open mic nights.","We have budgeted the project at $100,000 and do not anticipate exceeding our projected budget. If in the rare case we do exceed our budget we can tap into our revenue generated by our bookstore sales as well as solicit donations and sponsorships through our Board of Directors.","Overhead allocation for lead organization: $15,000
 Project Coordinator: $20,000
 Workshop Instructors and Facilitators: $45,000
 Publicity and Marketing: $5,000
 Documentation: $5,000
 Partner contribution (Reforma LA) $10,000","This project presents our organization with the exciting possibility of laying the foundation for a new level of creative work throughout the city of Los Angeles, both during this project and continuing afterwards. Our consistent interest in engaging and building authentic empowered communities through the arts is a matter of record. As we prepare to celebrate our fifteenth-year milestone in 2016, we are meeting with stakeholders at all levels of the organization--from board members, staff members, collaborators, facilitators, volunteers and community members--to envision the next period of our growth, sustainability and relevance to the community we serve. 
 
 This examination of our trajectory includes reimagining the boundaries of who and where that community exists, and how we can collectively reach it. The need to infuse the arts into a whole new myriad of community spaces and activities is essential to revitalizing the discussion of what it means to be alive, creative and present in the world. Our surroundings and relationships reveal the need for new ideas, new ways of solving our common problems and of appreciating our shared dreams. The prospect of putting the full creative weight of the arts and artists into the mix to make a real difference citywide is worth contributing our gifts to and supporting.
 
 This project is expressive of our desire to move this work further along these lines, now and in the future.
 
 Because of the unique approach of community engagement through this project we have begun to identify other foundations that have this as their funding priorities such as the James Irvine Foundation and their Exploring Engagement Fund Grant. We also hope that this project can be a catalyst to bring together many more collaborators around Los Angeles who are doing great work around poetry and expand the partnership to potentially develop a city-wide crowdsourcing campaign to expand the work to a larger scale."

 We’re building an app that makes it fast, fun, and easy to become informed in any election. Simply answer a few questions and find out which politicians truly have your best interests at heart, and have a track record to back it up.
 
 Our mission is to take the friction out of becoming an informed voter, displaying the candidates and propositions that align with your beliefs, as well as where to go to vote, when to be there, and what to bring. We aim to be a one-stop-shop for election information.
 
 We were recently featured on 790 KABC, Built In LA, and The Washington Post.
 
 
 Why
 Last year, LA county had the lowest voter participation of any county in the state, with local election turnout dropping as low as 8%.
 
 Information is greatly lacking when it comes to local elections. When people are uninformed, they don’t vote, or worse, they vote on issues they don’t know about. In both scenarios, we end up with a government that is not representative of its people.
 
 According to Pew, 57% of 18-to-29 year olds get political news from social networking apps and nowhere else. The stage is primed to engage millennials and younger generations on their turf.
 
 
 How
 We've designed an experience that is fast, fun and engaging, while the real magic happens under the hood. Our matching algorithm does all the heavy lifting, weighing millions of data points to find the perfect candidates for you.
 
 Thanks to new open data initiatives, we now have access to up-to-the-minute governmental and political data. This allows us to take an unbiased, numbers-based approach.
 
 Voter weighs a politician’s voting record, public agenda, personal views, talking points, and several other variables to arrive at a match. The app presents this information as a percentage, describing how closely your views align with each candidate.
 
 
 Who
 Our team has extensive experience in the fields of graphic design and user interfaces, mobile app development, policy and data analysis, and start-up user growth. We recently launched in beta, and just brought marketing and public relations experience on board.
 
 
 When
 Voter launched in the App Store on Citizenship Day (Sept.17) 2015, and will be available on web and Android January 1st, 2016. Local election data will be available for Los Angeles county starting in 2016.
 
 
 Where
 Based in sunny Los Angeles, California :) We will begin curating local elections in the Los Angeles area this Winter-Spring.","Most local candidates don’t have track records that we can pull data from, so it requires more effort to curate the information. However, between our growing user base (24k as of 9/28), and the support of local officials, candidates have been very enthusiast to help us build their presence on Voter. We are planning to work with Dean Logan (LA County Registrar), who has offered to assist with local data, to make sure we deliver fast, accurate results to Los Angeles voters.
 
 We have relationships with several local universities, including Chapman, Loyola, Pepperdine, USC, and UCLA, to bring poli-sci interns on board to assist with candidate outreach and data culling.
 
 To create a sustainable system for curating local election information, our goal is to attract enough users that candidates for local office are incentivized to build their own profile, or risk missing a large percentage of the voting population.","Voting by race - We’ll use demographic data from Facebook logins to track users’ voting rates by ethnicity, age, gender, and location. We respect privacy, and all data is anonymous in that we can never identify it to a specific user.
 
 Rates of volunteerism - Compare the NCoCs (National Conference on Citizenship) annual volunteer metrics from the past to track progress in LA county. We will survey users at regular intervals, comparing our own results with the NCoCs.
 
 Neighborhood council participation - We plan to curate information on Los Angeles’s 96 neighborhood council elections. We will encourage and track neighborhood council participation by connecting users with councils in their area, and allowing them to check-in via social media.
 
 Government responsiveness - Periodically survey our user-base to gauge whether they feel responsiveness has improved. Our impact will be magnified by giving politicians insight into the issues their constituents prioritize most.","The only platform with the same core concept, is iSideWith, though their target audience and execution are much different than ours. We are targeting millennials and younger voters, and aim to make the experience fun, fast, and fact-based.
 
 iSideWith does not have local information, and only matches users to national candidates. We are planning to curate data all the way down to local elections, beginning in Los Angeles.
 
 Additionally, the iSideWith quiz is akin to a test one would take in high school. It’s not something people are going out of their way to participate in.
 
 By contrast, we've designed Voter to be fast and engaging. We prioritize usability, focusing on making the experience fun and intuitive. We feature a tinder-inspired layout, in which users simply swipe on issues to indicate their position.
 
 We consider iSideWith complementary rather than competitive.

5102126,Popup Venue for 2016 Hollywood Fringe,2015080,,,HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017 festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local community greater accessibility to the festival; (2) increases the participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"One square mile in Hollywood. Borders are La Brea to the west, Western to the East, Franklin to the north, and Melrose to the south.",ALL,"HFF is looking to test a pop-up theatre venue during the 2016 and 2017 Festivals to explore whether a temporary venue (1) provides the local community greater accessibility to the Festival; (2) increases the participation of performers and producers from lower economic backgrounds by providing a subsidized cost for renting space; and (3) acts as a catalyst for additional theatrical spaces to grow in the community.
 
 The pop-up venue will take currently abandoned space on Hollywood’s Theatre Row and turn it into a vibrant component of Hollywood’s theatrical ecosystem. Hollywood’s Theatre Row is on Santa Monica Boulevard between El Centro Avenue and McCadden Avenue. Having the pop-up venue in this location will help the area remain the theatrical hub for the Festival as some theatres in the area are closing their doors. 
 
 The venue will be managed by HFF and have dedicated show producers. This model will allow for a lower cost per performance to the artist, with preference given to those from underserved groups in the Hollywood community. The pop-up venue will also have high visibility on Theatre Row and in Festival communications, and will be promoted as a potential model that artists can adopt to showcase their art, whether in the Festival or elsewhere. In addition, HFF will publicly share its learnings and best practices of running the pop-up venue, giving artists and other potential pop-up managers a “how-to” guide if they wish to build a pop-up venue of their own.
 
 One of HFF’s goals is to increase its engagement with the local community, especially those from underserved ethnicities and those with lower incomes. Historically, HFF has had a broad array of individuals from different socioeconomic levels participate. Based on a survey of participants in the 2014 Festival, 23% of attendees made less than $25,000 a year and 50% made less than $50,000 a year. The age range of participants is also multi-generational, with 32% under the age of 35, 45% between the ages of 35 to 54, and 23% aged 55 or older.
 
 Moving forward, HFF wants to ensure that the underserved in the Hollywood community become an integral part of the Festival. HFF is already working toward this by leveraging its website and technology platform to provide scholarships and free/subsidized tickets for potential performers and audience members from underserved groups.","One of the biggest challenges for the pop up venue project is securing a location on Theatre Row. At a time where many theatres have closed due to economics, landlords are trying to sell their properties for redevelopment for the highest possible price. In their eyes, renting out their space for one month could be an obstacle to sellnig their property.
 
 HFF has been collaborating with the Hollywood Media District BID for the past few years. The BID is compromised of 220 commercial property owners in the Hollywood area and one of the aims of their organization is to enhance the beautification and commercial desirability of the area. 
 
 In 2015, the two organizations worked together to put together a temporary 'parklet' in Hollywood. It was a successful endeavor and the HFF would use this relationship to locate and rent the best location for the pop up venue project.","HFF will judge the pop-up venue project’s performance upon it meeting the following goals:
 
 (1) To create and manage a pop-up venue for the Hollywood Fringe that will support 25-30 shows at $100 per slot (over 200% lower than market rate) during the June 2016 and June 2017 Festivals
 
 (2) To provide 5-10 venue scholarships to performers or producers from underserved economic and/or ethnic groups 
 
 (3) To show through example how to create viable theatrical pop-up venues, with 1-3 additional pop-up spaces established by individual artists or producers during the June 2017 Fringe Festival
 
 (4) To share the findings and best practices on the Fringe website and with partner organizations, reaching an estimated audience of 20-25,000.","While there are many theatre companies through out Los Angeles, there is no other organization that brings all of them together like the Hollywood Fringe Festival. During the month of June, thousands of artists converge on Theatre Row to take part in HFF. The sense of community within the performing arts that has been cultivated is unique to the city. 
 
 As Ben Moroski, a two time participant states: The Hollywood Fringe Festival creates a vibrant, uncensored space for a community of artists committed to ideals of the artistic process to come together, produced and share their work, try and fail in ways that are nearly impossible elsewhere. It is a breeding ground for new ideas, confident thought, young talent, fresh work, fearless expression. Whatever success I have in my artistic career going forward will always be due, in large part, to the start the Hollywood Fringe Festival gave me. I owe it and its staff a huge debt of gratitude for standing up for the arts, accepting me and the stories I have to tell, and creating a place where anything is possible, if you have the will and guts to put it on a stage.","Personnel will account for roughly one third of the budget of the project. The key individuals will fill the following roles:
 
 Pop-up Producer: Book performers for slots on offer at venue. Will be seasoned Fringe producer with proven track record. Estimated budget: $10,000
 
 Pop-Up General Manager: Oversee selection, contracting, build-out and operation of venue, including locating and contracting space. Will also outfit venue with box office, front of house, seating, staging, lighting, sound, video systems, and provide oversight on operations of venue during installation, technical rehearsals and performances. Dave McKeever, HFF’s Producing Director, will fulfill this role. No budget needed. 
 
 Pop-Up Technical Director: Oversee technical aspects of venue during installation, rehearsal and performance. Will manage installation of seating, staging, lighting, sound and video systems. Will also oversee setup crews, provide training/assistance during technical rehearsals and oversee system operations during performances. Estimated budget: $5,000
 
 Pop-Up Front of House Manager: Run a customer-friendly operation, including box office, seating assistance, ushering, catering and sanitation. Estimated budget: $5,000","The popup venue project has been budgeted at $148,000. HFF is currently applying for grant funding to cover the additional costs. 
 
 Subsidized rent from the pop up venue should cover $10,000-$15,000 of the additional costs. Any other costs will be covered by the Hollywood Fringe organization's budget.","Direct Costs:
 Lighting/Power: $20,000

 HFF will share findings and best practices with interested parties who wish to establish a pop up venue. Using these tools, producers and artists will be able to help lift up the dwindling theatrical spaces in the Hollywood area and revitalize the area."

PWW has a solution: bring early learning out of the classroom and into the community with pop-up preschools, place based learning, and community run co-ops.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Play,"We all know that creating access to high quality, early learning experiences for low-income children is one of the most pressing social justice issues of the 21st century. Children who have positive early learning experiences get better grades, have higher graduation rates, and earn more money. Most of us—do-gooders, funders, policy makers, early childhood advocates—believe that the path to improving early childhood care is to encourage and fiscally support low-income children in attending preschool and then improve the preschool workforce through professional development. The problem is that the vast majority of the most vulnerable children do not, and will not, go to preschool. In Los Angeles, 80% of the most vulnerable children attend license exempt friends, family, and neighbor care (FFN). They hang with grandma, play with aunty, or are watched by the neighbor down the hall. In LA County there are over 200,000 children in this type of care. 
 Preschool Without Walls (PWW) has a solution to this problem. Rather than pushing families into traditional school, PWW brings early learning experiences into the community through a three-part model. First, we operate informal preschools on city blocks, in public housing rec rooms, in church basements—pretty much anywhere FFN providers naturally spend time. These informal preschools offer research based, culturally relevant, free early learning activities including story time, dramatic play, and arts and crafts. Second, PWW operates place based preschools in libraries, parks, school sites, and churches for ongoing structured learning experiences using easily replicated activities in readily available community environments. These “place based” programs meet weekly and have been designed by the UCLA School of Education to leverage the use of public spaces as natural learning environments. Lastly, FFN providers are supported in organizing community based co-ops—groups of local FFN providers who meet regularly and are supported with take-home activity guides, links to community resources, low-cost learning materials for home use, and daily text messaged activities. Each co-op is visited by PWW staff, providing feedback and support around skills and activities developed in PWW sessions. 
 Does PWW work? According to evaluations by UCLA’s School of Social Welfare of PWW’s pilot program 90% of PWW children improved in every category of school readiness.","FFN providers are a difficult demographic to engage, organize, and support. These folks are often disconnected from, and distrustful of, traditional institutions. This social isolation is the primary barrier facing PWW. To address this challenge, PWW is based on, and builds off of, SBCC’s Relationship-Based Community Organizing model (RBCO). This model, developed at Northwestern University, is considered a promising best practice for community engagement. SBCC has the largest RBCO initiative in Los Angeles operating over 100 resident-led neighborhood groups, with over 1,500 individuals. These groups are composed primarily of individuals from the low-income communities of color that make most extensive use of FFN care. A significant number of participants are themselves FFN providers. PWW leverages the RBCO infrastructure to outreach directly to FFN providers through people they know and trust.","PWW has an evaluation model designed and implemented by UCLA’s School of Social Welfare. Outcome areas measured for children include: developmental gains (motor skills, letter and number recognition, positive play and socialization); improved school readiness and physical health as measured by teacher interviews, standardized kindergarten assessments; outcome areas measured for parents/providers include: increase in positive developmental behaviors, including parent-child reading, parent-child play, and overall parent engagement; number of parents/providers demonstrating increased knowledge on formal early learning resources and programs; number of parents enrolling their children in formal early learning programs, number of parents/providers demonstrating increased knowledge and increased use with their children of community learning and development resources in parks, home and neighborhood, libraries, and schools.","Experts in early childhood have called FFN the third rail of early learning systems building and have mostly ignored this critical population. Few initiatives in Los Angeles are working with the FNN population. First Five LA conducted a research study in 2007 to understand the needs of FFN providers and implemented a limited pilot project. In 2015, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation contracted with Harding and Company to map the FFN landscape. This assessment found no comparable community based programs to PWW. According to the report, attempts to reach the FFN population are primarily focused on parent engagement/training and family strengthening including projects by Families In Schools, Abriendo Puertas, Magnolia Place Community Initiative, Youth Policy Institute, and CSUN Neighborhood Partners in Action Institute for Community Health and Wellbeing. 
 There are a number of national initiatives to bring information on early learning to communities. Too Small to Fail, an initiative of the Clinton Global Foundation, aims to help parents and businesses take meaningful actions to improve the health and well-being of children ages zero to five by promoting new research on the science of children’s brain development, early learning and early health. VROOM is an app, developed by the Bezos Foundation, which supports parents with daily “brain building” activities to do with children 0-5. While important, neither of these offers direct programing for FFN providers in the Los Angeles area and have limited cultural relevance for diverse populations. They are both, however, potential partners to support PWW with additional best practices. VROOM specifically could provide complementary services to PWW text messaging approach to support FFN providers within PWW network with daily enrichment activities.","PWW has built strategic partnerships that align and leverage the resources and expertise of a number of partners. Some of the partners were funded at the pilot stage to develop curriculum and instructional models; others are leveraging existing resources to support PWW. While all of these partners are essential to PWW, two will receive direct funding from the LA 2050 challenge. Partners include:
 
 • UCLA School of Education and Information Studies has partnered with PWW to develop a place based learning curriculum that is culturally relevant for the FFN population. The curriculum is designed to turn local assets such as the libraries, parks, and small businesses, into learning opportunities. Each model is progressive and builds the capacity of FFN providers to utilize these local learning sites on an ongoing basis. UCLA School of Education and Information Studies will receive $10,000. 
 • UCLA School of Social Welfare develops and implements the program evaluation model for PWW
 • County and local library systems provide space, free of cost, for “learning in the library” programs as well as access to ongoing literacy services. Currently PWW works with the LA County and city library system and will expand to work with municipal libraries where necessary
 • County and city parks and programs host “preschool in the park” providing space for PWW in 9 parks in SPA 8 and will provide an additional 6 locations for future PWW expansion.
 • Los Angeles County Department of Children’s and Family Services is an ongoing funding partner providing fiscal resources to place families engaged with protective services in PWW programs
 • Cal State Dominguez Hills provides early childhood interns to PWW locations free of cost.
 • Bring Me a Book Foundation provides free early literacy materials to PWW locations.","SBCC is seeking $100,000 to expand its successful PWW pilot throughout Los Angeles County. There are two primary costs associated with PWW: one time start-up and one year operational costs to build the community based investment and ongoing operational costs to sustain the program. The start-up costs of expanding the number of PWW place based locations for one year is $100,000, the amount of the grant requested from LA 2050 and outlined in the budget. Beyond LA 2050 resources, further PWW expansion sites can be funded from foundations strategically aligned with PWW’s mission. While FFN has historically been ignored, an interest in them is emerging. In 2012, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation announced a 10-year, $100 million early learning initiative, which included investments in FFN. The Bezos Foundation created the app VROOM and has began to explore partners and funding local initiatives working with non-traditional preschool communities; and First Five LA conducted a horizon scan of the FFN landscape and has invested in pilot programing. These, and other private sector funders, can provide catalytic start-up resources for new PWW programs
 PWW has also received a grant from LAUP to support expansion and ongoing operating costs. The Department of Children and Family Services has also expressed interest in this model and we are currently conducting a pilot in a partnership with the DCFS Torrance office. We are currently working with the Bring Me a Book Foundation as well as CSU Dominguez Hills to explore additional funding and a partnership with them. And we will be submitting a proposal to The David and Lucile Packard Foundation.","PERSONNEL

Beyond the LA 2050 expansion site, we will achieve this bold vision by leveraging existing public systems and advocating for systems to bring learning out of the classroom and into the community. 
 SBCC’s role as a strategic community engagement partner to First Five LA’s Best Start programs creates an opportunity for PWW to offer our place based learning model in the Best Start Communities. Created in 1998 to invest LA County’s allocation of funds from California’s Proposition 10 tobacco tax, First 5 LA is a leading early childhood advocate working collaboratively across LA County. In 2011, First Five LA created a place based strategy called Best Start working in 14 vulnerable communities across LA County. SBCC is a funded strategic community engagement partner in 13 Best Start communities operating 100 community action groups with over 1,500 residents. This strategic partnership with First 5 LA Best Start will be an asset in expanding PWW programs throughout LA County. 
 Second, SBCC will partner with other community-based organizations to work in locations outside of the 14 Best Start locations. There are hundreds of community based non-profits throughout Los Angeles County that have deep relationships with the population of families that utilizes FFN care. Moreover, many of these non-profits have a mission to support families. PWW provides these CBO's with a cost effective model to strengthen early outcomes within these communities. PWW will partner with these CBOs to provide technical assistance and support implementation. Finally, in addition to expanding on the ground programming, PWW will work with the LA County and city library system to remove barriers to “early childhood library learning” and leverage opportunities to enhance libraries as early learning centers for all children and partner with the LA County and city parks system to support “preschools in the park” bringing the best practices of place based learning to every city in LA County."
5102245,Promesa Boyle Heights,2018098,,,"It takes a village to nurture a child’s success. A thriving student is the result of more than a good school. It is also a thriving community with jobs, affordable housing, wellness access, & strong social networks. That is why, we are united around a vision where: 1) every child has an opportunity to learn, grow & succeed from cradle through college and career; 2) families can live a stable, healthy and fulfilling life; and 3) every individual is empowered to act & create a more just community.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,"While the Promesa vision is specific to Boyle Heights, our systems change work and contributions to communities of practice will impact Los Angeles as a whole.",ALL,"Our work began in 2010, when Boyle Heights became one of 21 communities nationally to receive a Promise Neighborhood planning grant from the US DOE. We galvanized a planning process in which 4000+ youth, adult residents, educators, and community partners came together to share lived experiences, reflect on community data, and develop a common vision and action plan.
 
 We transitioned into the first phase of implementation of our plan in 2011. With no dedicated funding, we embarked on the plan’s first strategy: establishment of a community-school model at Mendez HS with the goal of increasing graduation rates and building a college going culture. Together, we: 1) formalized results-oriented partnerships between school staff, families & organizations; 2) launched targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hired an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness efforts. 
 
 In the end, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 30% from 2010 and 2015. Recently, Mendez HS became the most improved traditional HS in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school’s opening. We began scaling up and building similar efforts at Hollenbeck MS and Roosevelt HS. Next, we will:
 
 1. Begin construction of the early education and elementary school strategies in our cradle-to-career Road to Success. We will sustain our current efforts and launch a campaign to increase awareness and connect families of children 0-8 to child development, wellness, support groups & other community resources. In collaboration with early education providers, schools & families, we will develop a shared plan of action to expand access and quality to early education opportunies & transitional supports from Pre-K to 3rd grade.
 
 2. Engage and empower 2000+ new residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to the existing Promesa Wellness Series, and galvanizing more community participation in community campaigns that expand access to school-based wellness centers, affordable housing, early education opportunities, and foster funding equity and transparency in the schools. 
 
 3. We will continue to be a thought leader and an action leader in the placed-based, community-school, and collective impact communities of practice, helping integrate cross-sector approaches that expand the boundaries of education and community transformation.","The Promesa BH model is a major paradigm shift for community transformation, and we fully realize that it will take time and effort to help others understand the value of a collective impact models that bridges across issues (e.g. education & affordable housing) and approaches (e.g. direct services & organizing) that are typically viewed and funded in isolation. We need to get better at explaining the multiplying impact of linking and aligning our community efforts and how building resident leadership is key to sustainability.
 
 How much ground must we still cover? In an immediate sense, the 4,000+ residents who participated in the planning process are but a small fraction of BH’ 95,000+ residents. For the purposes of this project, we will need to align & build partnerships for our early education goals in the context of a fractured early education system composed of formal & informal providers whose requirements, funding sources, & assessments are guided by multiple sources.","Evaluation of our existing Community-School (C-S) model in the schools draws from student-level quantitative & qualitative data. Our C-S model at Mendez HS is part of a comparison group evaluation by AT&T Aspire to empirically assess the impact of our efforts. We have a PN evaluation plan that is the foundation for development/implementation of our evaluation/data systems. We will evaluate projected impact through ongoing data analysis and are committed to using data/evaluation to better understand the impact of our work & share findings with others.
 
 Our early education strategies will be added to our logic model & evaluation plans. We plan to track the number of providers, schools, organizations, & parents engaged over time as well as the intensity and type of collaboration fostered. We will track resident growth & leadership over time using our existing civic engagement tools that track self-identified leadership goals & participation in leadership academies, actions, etc.","Promesa Boyle Heights is strengthening education and wellness opportunities in our corner of Los Angeles while generating best practices that will inspire and help other communities in LA. 
 
 Although there are other Promise Neighborhoods throughout the country – both those that received planning grants from the DOE and still others that also received DOE implementation funds – Promesa Boyle Heights is unique because of its collective impact model and resident-led governance structure. 
 
 While within so many other initiatives one organization oversees the distribution of resources and the implementation of strategies, we view residents as capable and essential leaders who must take ownership of the work. We have also brought cross-sector partners together to strategize and work towards shared goals – non-profits, schools, and institutional partners alike. 
 
 The sheer range of our strategies is also unique, encompassing direct services, the building of local capacity, shifting of local cultures, and impacting broader systemic change.","California State University, Los Angeles

This plan includes working towards the day when we have a strong Community-School and resident leadership infrastructure at each school, when we a strong and coordinated Early Learning Network, and a Transition to College Network in Boyle Heights. 
 
 As part of our involvement in the national Promise Neighborhood Institute, we are also beginning to share best practices and tools with other communities and organizations in Los Angeles and throughout the nation. We see this as an important part of our contribution towards the field of education and community transformation."
5102116,Providing minority students opportunities in science technology engineering and mathematics.,2015074,,,"Great Minds will be a hands-on, research-based initiative set to improve the STEM skills of boys and girls in Grades K-12, which will include sustained professional development for teachers that focus on effective instructional strategies and methodologies. Our organization goal is to have an innovative STEM program that will be a leader in preparing youth, who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, to become scientific scholars.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,City of Inglewood,Learn,"African Americans, Hispanics, and women are overwhelmingly underrepresented in many STEM fields. Inadequate preparation in STEM subjects has major consequences in higher education, which limits their participation in many well-paid, high-growth professions. GMSS programs and services will encourage the enhancement in the academic development of our boys and girls by instilling a sense of competence, influence, and ownership. GMSS will not only be a place for learning and growth, but a place students can come in with their curious minds to have fun in discovering the strengths and limitations of each STEM field, absorbing these phenomena as a multifaceted and intricate whole. It will be a place where scientific futures are planted in the minds of our youth every single day. 
 GMSS is more than compelled to give youth in the City of Inglewood something of their own: a scientific facility in their community, one that they will know belongs to them. We want to give youth the sense of ownership and pride within their community uniting them with something positive. The goal of this program is to provide youth with the instructional activities to develop hands-on experience and skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. Participants in this program will improve their overall efficiency in the basic subjects of math and science while being prepared to take on other rigorous STEM coursework, required to succeed in such specialized fields. As a result of our program, these students also will benefit in the overall improvement of their grades and their level of achievement on the California Standardized Test. To facilitate student improvement, GMSS will secure a facility containing labs for science, technology, engineering and math activities. 
 Great Minds STEM Society will also create a professional STEM development program to improve teachers’ subject matter and content knowledge in STEM. GMSS will train teachers to develop specialized teaching techniques as well as instructional strategies, allowing him or her to establish effective methods for teaching their students STEM subjects. It is important to GMSS and the students of Inglewood to provide these teachers with the support needed to create effective curricula and tools for identifying students’ success.
 In addition we will provide free workshops for people in the community needing skills in Microsoft Office which will be essential for them to be better suited for employment opportunities.","We recognize the challenges we will face, as students will come into our program with varying characteristics and different emotional states. Some will lack confidence and some will even come in a little timid. Our organization will be able to present these students with a positive role model, helping each one cope with his/her everyday challenges. We want to provide the direct resources these students need in order to overcome their situational barriers by implementing life development workshops that offer youth the benefits and services of behavioral management, healthy relationships, and community outreach. This comprehensive approach will afford them the opportunity to understand how their actions are an impactful influence to their personal being and how strong healthy relationships are vital to their personal growth. It is also an important benefit to teach these students the importance of giving back to the community in which they were raised.","Each student will have an individual profile containing their school grades, state assessment results, and their initial math assessment from GMSS. Student profiles will be monitored and updated weekly examining areas of weaknesses, completed and uncompleted projects, attendance, number of hours used at the facility, number of hours on specific project, and skills acquired and mastered. Our evaluations committee composed of GMSS staff, school district administrators, and faculty will conduct initial student evaluations. Our committee will evaluate students quarterly, analyzing their progress and capability to meet academic expectations. These results will reveal the students’ rate of growth, strengths, weaknesses, and motivation. Students start by taking a customized assessment in math, which will assist us in identifying their needs, allowing GMSS to meet them where they are academically and develop them into scholastically inclined students.","There are no known organizations doing similar work in the community of Inglewood. Great Minds is unique when compared to other organizations in outside cities. GMSS will provide students with hands-on skills developing their comprehension in Chemistry, Biology, Math, Computer Programming, and Engineering. We are going to provide a supporting and nurturing environment for these youth. We simply want them to feel safe, secure, and free of educational ridicule. We also will have an ethnically diversified staff one that will be a strong representation of the community we serve. GMSS believe it is extremely important for these students to learn from people who have had similar cultural experiences growing up but have accomplish their dreams in becoming a minority STEM professional. This approach will allow for a better teacher-student relationship, thus, providing them with the motivation that they too can succeed in such fields. Here at GMSS we will provide even more attention to our minority women. 
 
 Minority women face an even greater achievement gap because not only are they not being introduced to these fields, the education they receive is not sufficient enough to warrant such a career, let alone an interest. Great Minds STEM Society will not just encourage women to practice STEM fields; it will prepare these women to pursue these fields. We are going to create a cultivating environment for these women with role models represented by other women who are pursuing fields in STEM from nearby universities. We are going to establish science clubs for women and academic retreats so they will know how important they are to not only our program, but to the society in which we live. In attracting women into our program we have to develop an inside out approach. For women, it is not about the level of competence, it is about knowing there is a place for them to achieve their goals by providing them with a supportive environment that creates a personal identity in a field that is currently dominated by males. 
 Our level of support in every aspect of a students' life is what separates us from similar organizations. GMSS simply wants to be the role model they will support them at all cost.","There will be no other partners or collaborators on this project that will receive an outright share of this grant. Great Minds STEM Society will hire people on contractual terms and all financial obligations will be part of the general budget. However, we will have collaborate with the school board and the City of Inglewood to ensure success of our project through a community effort.","Great Minds STEM Society believe the estimated cost of leasing the property along with technological equipment will be approximately $60,000. Our organization will use an additional $20,000 to cover financial obligations to STEM professionals, guest speakers, and administrative cost. Great Minds STEM Society have constructed a budget that will not exceed the total cost of the grant during the first year. Our goal is to stay within budget and additional cost, if any, will be raised through fund raisers, private donors, and additional grants such as local and federal government funding. In addition we are working diligently to perform partnerships with BioRad, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and aerospace. These companies have community programs that can potentially sponsor any additional needs and cost.","Property Lease-$25,000 for 1 year

We would like to obtain enough money through grants and other avenues to build our own facility that can hold an influx of students. GMSS would like to build something similar to that of a Boys and Girls Club but strictly dedicated to the profession of STEM. GMSS will be the after school STEM program you will find all the students in the neighborhood spending their time and honing their STEM skills. Our goal is to build four professional, fully equipped science labs comprising of a Biology lab, Analytical Chemistry lab, Organic Chemistry lab, and a Marine Biology lab that will provide students with a wide variety of hands-on opportunities in which students practice technique, gather data, and draw conclusions from those data. GMSS would also like to create an innovative technology and robotics Lab aimed at providing students with the breadth of knowledge that is required for specialization in STEM fields."

Re:Ciclos empowers both its students and cargo bike recipients to directly address these negative consequences in our city through direct action. The positive effects of the Re:Ciclos project: 
 
 >Youth education and empowerment
 >Replaces car trips with more bicycle trips
 >General improvement of the physical environment by mitigating pollution
 >Assists in traffic congestion reduction 
 >Greatly improves the health of those utilizing cargo bicycles through regular exercise

 By educating its youth to take control of its transportation modes, Re:Ciclos tools the future with mobility alternatives that are healthy, viable and that mitigate global pollution and replaces negative and damaging consumer cycles with ones that reduce, re-use and recycle. The Los Angeles that Re:Ciclos envisions is filled with bicycle trips and infrastructure, healthy citizens, safe streets for all and a physical environment that reinvigorates the process of renewal rather than continuing to feed the deleterious effects of car culture.","There is one major challenge that Re:Ciclos considers: follow-through for students.
 
 Fabricating bicycles takes dedication and concentration. Students will have personalities, life circumstances and timing that will be factors in a their ability to engage fully. Re:Ciclos takes a collaborative, creative and hands-on approach to teaching, always engaging the student with challenges and perspectives which will solicit participation, self-sufficiency and collective problem solving. Further, working hand-in-hand with educational institutions to credit their students toward academic goals will incentivize students in completion of work. Moreover, having the students working directly with clients, seeing their work first-hand in action in communities of need further empowers their contributions and informs their ability to enact change in issues that affect them, their city and the world at large.","Fabricating cargo bicycles is a self-evaluating process. Each bicycle will be unique in design as students work with clients collaboratively to meet specific needs and application. At the realization of each of project Re:Ciclos will engage the recipients and students in evaluating the work and function of each bicycle to improve upon process and product. Further, students are invited to return to the program as mentors to assist new participants in tackling all aspects of design, community/client engagement and fabrication. Re:Ciclos is a three-way street: teachers, students and clients will work together in stages to ultimately arrive at a program that delivers its message and goal. Students, instructors and clients alike will conduct group evaluation at the end of each session with the aim of incorporating the aggregate wisdom into the future curriculum.","There are currently no organizations doing the specific work we propose doing in Los Angeles. While community bicycle repair spaces exists, none of the current projects have the capacity or programming to fabricate, educate and engage with their communities to the degree and in the hands-on manner that Re:Ciclos proposes. Further, our city is in dire need of more alternative transportation both with regard to selection and accessibility. Cargo bicycles enable a diverse group of citizens to choose healthier and more affordable modes of mobility. Re:Ciclos is a project that bridges youth empowerment, education, environmental responsibility and transportation in an immediately demonstrable and effective action: bicycling.","The Bicycle Kitchen is the fiscal sponsor of Re:Ciclos. Re:Ciclos will be incurring space, insurance, material and administrative costs associated with utilizing the Bicycle Kitchen facility as its home and promoting its project. Our budget details these costs incurred.
 Re:Ciclos has further entered into contract with RMH Media, a public-relations and marketing firm working with non-profits, to assist in promotions, grant and media management. For their work, RMH Media will receive 10% of monies raised through this effort.","Projected budget for Re:Ciclos is $150,000. The project is currently establishing a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign along with several fundraising events. Additionally, Re:Ciclos programming incorporates sale of cargo bicycles at a sliding scale to individuals, organizations and or businesses to offset the cost of materials and consumables used in the fabrication process.","Re:Ciclos takes a multi-disciplinary approach to achieving its mission -- the budget is broken up into the base essentials necessary to achieve its program. 
 
 EQUIPMENT ($15,100) -- Used in the fabrication process are several machines and specialty tools specific to frame building cargo bikes.
 OFFICE/UTILITIES/RENT ($13,015) -- Re:Ciclos will need to run a small office in keeping track of allocated funds and its general programming. Insurance is included in this line item.

 WEB MNGT ($1,285)
 PR/MEDIA/GRANT MNGT ($10,000)","Increasing capacity is crucial in all aspects of the operation of Re:Ciclos. The number of cargo bicycles produced, students accredited, clients and community engaged, car trips reduced and a future of human-powered mobility in Los Angeles re-envisioned will serve as a scaling platform for the success of the project. Beyond that, the by-product of community collaborative design and initiative will produce an environment that can be replicated in different neighborhoods of the city with the purpose of gradually shifting from a car-centric dependency to a thriving, human-powered transportation model for Los Angeles that it increasingly needs. Re:Ciclos is not simply offering more bicycles--it is creating a venue and providing the tools to transform how its future imagines where to go and how to get there.
 
 Initially, the project will be broken up into six-week sessions, producing six cargo bicycles at a time. A total of three sessions will be held throughout the year. As capacity increases, Re:Ciclos aspires to run full-time, thereby increasing production and additionally engaging with more clientele to provide increased transportation alternatives to families, individuals, businesses and/or partners and organizations seeking to make a positive impact for the City of Los Angeles everyday and into the future. Long term, Re:Ciclos aspires to establish workshops, either as extensions of itself or as stand-alone cooperatives in East and South Los Angeles to impact those communities positively.
 
 Lastly, Re:Ciclos will be providing certificates of completion for participants fabricating cargo bicycles. Moreover, the project invites participants to continue involvement with the institution as mentors and to increase the scope of what the project delivers.
 
 Los Angeles is an amplifier of content. What succeeds in L.A. has the potential to influence what succeeds in other parts of the world. Re:Ciclos delivering alternative, affordable, functional, clean and accessible new modes of transport in this great city has the potential to foment this on a global scale, such as was seen with private, motorized automobiles a century ago. Increasing cargo bicycle presence in Los Angeles establishes a new scale: one that looks at the problem of mobility today and begins the healing process for a future that can no longer support its current transportation paradigm."
5102249,Reading Partners LA: The Path to Fourth Grade Reading Proficiency for 1000 Children,2015165,,,"Reading Partners plans to expand our core program in LA County and deepen local impact on fourth grade literacy achievement. In 2015-16, we have already expanded from eight to ten school partners, reaching at least 575 students with the support of 850 volunteers. By 2017, we intend to partner with an additional four to six new school sites, doubling our reach from 500 to 1,000 children in Los Angeles area Title I schools.",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,"Our current ten school partners are located in Pasadena, Mid-City LA, Santa Monica, and Lawndale. We are currently reaching out to new prospective partners where we hope to identify an additional four to six schools to collaborate with by 2016-17.",Learn,"Celebrating seven years in LA, Reading Partners looks forward to continuing to empower local communities to invest in the education of our youth by extending our proven early literacy intervention program to substantially more students throughout the county. We envision that all children will have the necessary literacy skills they need by fourth grade to achieve their fullest potential by leveraging the capacity of communities to close the achievement gap for struggling readers. To move toward this goal, we have two primary objectives:
 
 1. We will serve a much larger proportion of children in our current service areas. This school year, we have already increased participant density by expanding from eight to ten schools and serving 575 youth—a 25% increase in school partnerships from 2014-15.
 
 2. We will begin a strategic, major expansion of services set over the next two years. This will include identifying a new community where we will serve an additional four to six schools and 250-360 students, doubling our reach from 500 to 1,000 children by 2017.
 
 To ensure LA is the best place to learn, Reading Partners will continue to mobilize local schools, districts, and communities to catalyze change and become advocates for educational opportunities in their neighborhoods. We intentionally partner with Title I schools with a high percentage of low-income students where tailored intervention resources are in short supply despite students’ high needs. With a structured, research-based curriculum that requires no prior experience, we transform any volunteer into a high-quality instructor, enabling us to reach hundreds more children and increase the capacity of public schools. Our efforts also focus on young K-4 students early in their school careers to maximize the amount of instruction they receive before their achievement gap widens, ensuring that as many students possible are reaching proficiency by fourth grade.
 
 With 49% of low-income fourth graders reading below grade-level in LA County, thousands of children are at-risk of losing out on a more prosperous future that a strong education enables, and strong reading skills are especially important for children growing up in low-income communities where academic success is a critical pathway out of poverty. We are proud of our innovative and proven program model that harnesses the power of community service to provide an effective, affordable, and community-driven solution to the literacy crisis.","Since our program heavily relies on volunteers to provide one-on-one services, we anticipate that volunteer recruitment will be our biggest challenge as we can only enroll as many students as we have volunteers. Due to the sheer magnitude and geographical scope of our expansion, building a sustainable and reliable volunteer base is a top priority. To offset individual volunteer retention rates, last year, we implemented a new focus on building community partnerships with businesses, community organizations, and educational institutions that can be renewed every year. By emphasizing organization-level relationships as a dominant source of volunteers, we are confident that we can secure the volunteer base necessary to support our growth. Due in large part to these efforts, from 2013-14 to 2014-15, we increased volunteer recruitment by 34%. We hope to continue on this trajectory moving forward as we project needing roughly 1,300 volunteers to sustain an enrollment goal of 1,000 students.","Data collection and analysis is a core feature of Reading Partners’ program. To thoroughly evaluate students’ skills, we gather three sources of data. First, we collect results from research-based, elementary literacy assessment tools–STAR Early Literacy and STAR Early Reading. Both assessments provide growth targets for students that correspond to grade-level benchmarks. Our programmatic targets are also based on students’ reaching benchmarks tied to grade-level expectations. Second, we collect state standardized test scores and school-based evaluations to give us a more comprehensive picture of how students are doing relative to state English Language Arts standards. Finally, we gather impact data on improvements in students’ reading, self-confidence, and classroom participation through twice-annual teacher, principal, and tutor surveys. Together, these assessments enable us to benchmark students’ reading at enrollment, progress monitor and course-correct, and record overall growth.","Reading Partners is the only nationally scaled program in the country with the complete package of in-school, one-on-one literacy instruction by volunteers who are trained and supported by staff. At each school, we transform a dedicated classroom into a comprehensive Reading Center and recruit and train 40-100 volunteers. Student-tutor pairs work together for 45 minutes twice a week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs. To execute this plan, tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum; a series of research-based, structured lesson plans that progress from phonics instruction for earlier readers to comprehension strategy for more advanced students. Students are assessed four times per year to monitor their progress toward pre-established achievement goals and to help advise tutors on how to best support their students. With close oversight and assistance from senior staff, a trained AmeriCorps member is stationed at each site to provide coaching to volunteers and serve as a liaison to teachers and school staff. A Program Manager supervises a portfolio of reading centers and ensures consistent results and program fidelity. 
 
 Compared to other organizations that focus on individual or group read-a-louds, Reading Partners concentrates on tangible skill development and improves students' mastery of both the concrete and abstract skills necessary to be a confident, independent reader. Reading Partners’ students aren’t just exposed to literacy; they practice it. Accordingly, our program generates real changes in student achievement that are measurable and tracked over time in partnership with our schools.
 
 In March 2015, Reading Partners received the results of a multiyear, rigorous study conducted by MDRC, the nation’s leading education research firm. The study confirmed that our program model utilizing community volunteers is effective and produces a positive and statistically significant impact on students’ reading proficiency. In addition, program fidelity also remained consistent among sites across multiple regions, confirming that our program is also effective at scale. Lastly, because Reading Partners is able to provide one-on-one services to students, we are a resource multiplier for public schools. For every dollar invested, we are able to double the resources available to students by leveraging community resources, indicating that Reading Partners is a cost-effective option for under-resourced schools.","Reading Partners serves ten Title I elementary schools in Los Angeles County located in Pasadena, Mid-City Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Lawndale. We currently have strong relationships with both Lawndale and Pasadena School Districts, including a five-year partnership with the Pasadena Unified, where we have agreed to triple our impact in the district by increasing the number of students served from 163 in 2013-14 to over 500 students and from three to ten schools by 2018-19. In addition, we have ongoing partnerships with community-based organizations and businesses that generously provide volunteers to support our programming, including Cal State LA, City National Bank, LA RSVP, LA Works, and Manhattan Beach Community Church to name a few.
 
 As we begin outreach to prospective school, district, and community partners, we look to find another neighborhood to replicate the tremendous successes we’ve had in Pasadena. In addition to a strong partnership with the school district, Reading Partners has wonderful relationships with community organizations throughout the city such as the Pasadena Community Foundation, Pasadena Educational Foundation, and Pasadena City College that is able to provide the trifecta of financial, programmatic, and volunteer support to simultaneously sustain our current program and allow for growth.
 
 Though Reading Partners will provide our full scope of services at all of our school partners, the $100,000 grant would be used as seed money for capacity building and programmatic operations at each new school site. To help support a new site, Reading Partners requires partner schools and districts to invest in our program through fee for service. Fee for service revenue accounts for 13% of our total regional program budget and guarantees a diverse portfolio of private and public investors. Fee for service not only allows Reading Partners to better leverage philanthropic dollars to serve more schools, but also ensures school partners are invested in the success of our program.","In a spring 2015 planning session, it was identified that capacity building was necessary in three key areas: community engagement, program development, and board development and revenue generation. Because the magnitude of this expansion requires considerable financial and human capital, we have increased the number of personnel and resources dedicated to volunteer recruitment, school district partnerships, and fundraising, which are all existing costs in our current 2015-16 budget.
 
 To effectively double the number of students Reading Partners serves in Los Angeles moving forward, we anticipate needing an additional $300,000. A substantial part of this cost includes additional program staff to manage the portfolio of new sites, AmeriCorps Site Coordinators to staff each Reading Center, and an additional AmeriCorps Volunteer Coordinator to support volunteer recruitment and retention. Other direct costs associated with open a new Reading Center includes classroom supplies such as paper, pens, markers, and teaching supplies at roughly $250 per center; four complete sets of Reading Partners’ 148-level curriculum and 400-500 grade-level appropriate books per center at roughly $5,500 per school; as well as laptops for each of our new staff members at approximately $1,000 each. Lastly, with a significant influx of in volunteers to serve 1,000 students, the we anticipate the associated costs of our community engagement program to also increase, including additional reimbursements for tutor background checks, additional fees for conference and volunteer fair attendance, as well as more robust tutor appreciation events and additional marketing materials.
 
 To cover these costs, Reading Partners will receive funding from AmeriCorps to support a portion of each of the Site and Volunteer Coordinators’ stipends. Fee for service revenue also typically covers roughly 20% of the start-up costs of opening a new Reading Center at each school, such as program supplies and curriculum. Lastly, we will pursue diverse funding strategies to increase private philanthropy to underwrite the remaining additional costs. We are beginning this work in our current 2015-16 fiscal year, and have hired a full-time Development Manager charged with securing and increasing private revenue for program operations in the region.","If awarded, Reading Partners anticipates using the $100,000 LA2050 prize toward the following start-up costs to begin program implementation at the new school sites:
 
 EXPENSES:
 Program Associate salary: $40,000
 Volunteer Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps: $10,000
 Site Coordinator benefits not covered by AmeriCorps (4 positions at $10,000 each): $40,000
 Program Supplies: $1,000
 Curriculum: $5,000
 Technology (4 laptops at $1,000 each): $4,000
 TOTAL EXPENSES: $100,000
 LA2050 Requested Support: $100,000
 
 All expenditures listed above are entirely new costs associated with the second phase of our expansion plan and do not currently exist within our 2015-16 Los Angeles program budget.","Over the next ten years, Reading Partners’ organizational strategic plan is focused on increasing fourth grade national literacy achievement for low-income students by scaling and innovating our proven intervention program across the country. Los Angeles’ current expansion is essential to this growth. On a local level, we intend to replicate the success of our program in the Pasadena area, where strategic community and district-level relationships have critically affected the sustainability and growth of our program. By fall/winter 2015, we expect to have identified potential school and district partnerships in order to begin negotiations in spring 2016 for a summer 2016 launch date. 
 
 As we scale, our guiding principal is to create the highest-level of impact for as many students as possible. Testament to the value and impact of Reading Partners in LA, in 2014-15, 88% of students increased their rates of literacy learning while enrolled in our program, and on average, students more than doubled their rate of learning for every month enrolled in Reading Partners. In addition, 100% of principals at our partner schools reported improved reading progress school-wide and felt Reading Partners was a valuable asset to their schools. Our corps of Los Angeles-based volunteer tutors also gave nearly 15,000 hours of their time to support student literacy. Beyond just their time, our tutors also shared their energy, positivity, and belief in the importance of public education. Eighty-two percent of tutors reported they are more interested in public education due to their service with Reading Partners, and 76% reported that their experience with the organization strengthened their belief that not only teachers, but all citizens, can directly impact educational outcomes for children. 
 
 Having began at a single elementary school in 1999, today, Reading Partners is in 13 regions across the United States, directly serving more than 9,200 students in 180 schools with the support of more than 15,000 volunteers. By building on our current successes, we aspire to dramatically expand our impact, and ultimately have a positive effect on reading proficiency nationwide. At Reading Partners, we believe that literacy unlocks opportunity, and every child deserves to learn this fundamental skill that affords them the opportunity to comprehend, engage, and change the world around them. We look forward to advancing this critical work both here at home in Los Angeles and beyond."

Meanwhile, traditional prosecution and sentencing have nothing to do with the place where the crime was committed or even why the crime was committed; defendants are totally divorced from the communities that they affected by their crimes. Furthermore, low-level property crimes are often committed by individuals who feel isolated, ashamed, and disconnected from the people around them.
 
 ReConnect.la seeks to divert 10,000 would-be defendants from the criminal justice system by 2050 by partnering with local prosecuting agencies and establishing diversion programs that engage local community leaders to help reconnect the would-be defendant to their community, to hold them accountable for the crimes they committed through dialogue, and to work with the would-be defendant to ensure that they never commit a crime again. By building community through RCLA, community leaders can reduce crime and improve the economic well being of their neighborhoods.
 
 RCLA will provide a valuable volunteer experience for community members and training that may prove useful in other contexts. A RCLA volunteer placement would compliment other community activities, such as Neighborhood Council, Community Police Advisory Board, and Homeowner Associations, and allow for a more participatory environment in dealing with neighborhood issues. Furthermore, by implementing an RCLA program, prosecuting agencies would enjoy increased visibility in the neighborhoods they serve, thereby connecting their offices even more deeply with the community.","One major challenge to helping first-time offenders reconnect with their neighborhoods is convincing local prosecuting agencies to participate in the program. As a pre-filing diversion, RCLA will largely exist as an option for prosecutors when a case comes across their desk but before they decide to file charges. Therefore, there must be buy-in by prosecuting agencies to use RCLA as opposed to simply filing charges against the first-time offender. The Los Angeles City Attorney already has a pre-filing diversion designed to reconnect first-time offenders with their communities, the Neighborhood Justice Program, that was developed by Justice Lab founder Peter Borenstein.
 
 Prosecuting agencies are sometimes skeptical of new approaches to improving public safety. Therefore, in addition to pitching RCLA directly, community leaders who are interested in volunteering with RCLA could also petition their City Attorneys to implement the program.","Data collection will occur at every stage of the RCLA process and will be ongoing as the would-be defendant progresses through the program. Therefore, opportunities for evaluation will arise at many points.
 
 First, evaluation will occur monthly as RCLA staff and the prosecuting agency review the data collected from the last month of RCLA operations. By analyzing data monthly, stakeholders can learn where crimes are happening, who is committing them, and discover patterns on a micro level.
 
 Second, evaluation will occur once a year to develop a report detailing outcomes that RCLA participants have had, whether they have recidivated, and the effect that RCLA has had on the community through metrics such as community service hours completed by participants, and number of RCLA volunteers.","There are several larger organizations that focus on criminal justice reform more generally, such as the Center for Court Innovation or the Vera Institute for Justice, but none are focused on diverting would-be defendants from the criminal justice system before charges are filed and then working to reconnect them back to their communities. 
 
 Often when we think of reconnecting offenders to their communities, we think of prisoners reentering society after a period of incarceration. However, RCLA is innovative in that seeks to reconnect individuals who commit crimes before they ever step inside a courtroom. Reconnecting at this stage is critical because it provides benefits to all stakeholders in the criminal justice system, and also allows community leaders to get involved in a positive way. 
 
 Furthermore, the RCLA program philosophy is uniquely Californian, based on a diversion model first implemented by the San Francisco District Attorney in 2010. A similar diversion program, the Neighborhood Justice Program, was created by Justice Lab founder Peter Borenstein for the Los Angeles City Attorney in 2014.","RCLA will partner with local prosecuting agencies to implement a diversion that involves local community leaders in dealing with low-level crime. The first phase of implementation will involve consulting with the prosecuting agency to design and implement an RCLA program. The second phase will involve making the RCLA program within the prosecuting agency self-sufficient through staffing and training. 
 
 In this second phase, LA2050 grant funds ($25,000) will be used for hiring and supporting case managers, with additional funding coming from outside sources to ensure that RCLA is properly staffed at each prosecuting agency.","Justice Lab will oversee Phase 1 (Implementaton) with the local prosecuting agency over four months at a cost of $8,000 per month. Once RCLA has been implemented, it will require at least one compassionate, thorough, and detail oriented case manager to ensure that would-be defendants are being reconnected to their communities and volunteers are well-trained and effective. 
 
 LA2050 grant money will be used to partially fund one case manager at each partner prosecuting agency ($25,000). Therefore, if RCLA is implemented in two prosecuting agencies, then $50,000 of the LA2050 grant will be used to partially fund two case managers' salaries. Additional costs will be covered by funding from outside sources, as well as the partner prosecuting agencies, although the ultimate goal will be to implement and hand off RCLA to our partner agencies at no cost.","Phase 1: Implementation - $8,000 per month per prosecuting agency, which includes recruiting and training community volunteers, and developing a network of services to ensure success in reconnecting would-be defendants.
 
 Phase 2: Hand off to Partner Agency - $25,000 per RCLA case manager in each prosecuting agency, with additional funding coming from outside sources such as foundations and individuals, as well as any support that the partner agency may be able to afford. 
 
 Phase 3: Long-Term Sustainability of RCLA - an ongoing yearly commitment of $60,000 for each RCLA case manager in each prosecuting agency. To give a sense of how many case managers are required at any given prosecuting agency: If the prosecuting agency is able to divert 1,000 would-be defendants, then it would require at least five case managers to manage RCLA effectively.","The success and scaling of RCLA depends on prosecuting agencies understanding the need for a diversion that involves community members in dealing with low-level property crimes and/or first-time offenders who have been disconnected from their communities. 
 
 The ultimate goal of the RCLA campaign would be to have every municipality that prosecutes its own misdemeanors in Los Angeles County to have some sort of RCLA program running, thereby maximizing the number of would-be defendants diverted from the criminal justice system . The inclusive, community-oriented model that RCLA is based on is naturally scaleable as long as there is funding for RCLA case managers. This is the one of the strengths of RCLA program design in response to a dire need: The criminal justice system simply has too many cases in order to be effective. Therefore, the only challenge that exists with regard to scaling is the willingness of prosecutors to try something new."

The unfathomable experiences of a person in interaction with the scientific and technological advances as experienced in advanced heart failure are novel to patients and their families, and unknown to health care professionals (e.g. http://ampersand.gseis.ucla.edu/federica-raia-book-on-relational-medicine-reveals-doctor-patient-collaboration-2/; http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/q-a:-federica-raia-and-life-with-a-new-heart ). For the last five years, Dr. Federica Raia conducted an ethnographic and participatory research study on the practice of high-tech modern medicine in collaboration with the advanced heart failure cardiologist Dr. Mario Deng, director of the UCLA Integrated Advanced Heart Failure-Mechanical Support-Heart Transplant Program. Based on ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, the authors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of high-tech modern medicine (PS More information about this book can be found in http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9065). What Dr. Raia discovered in her research revealed that the marvels of technology mandate the practice of Relational Medicine, i.e. the integration of body, science technology and personhood into one singular framework of practice and that this integration can mean the difference between life and death. For the thousands of heart failure patients that receive treatment at UCLA Reagan Medical Center, their often prolonged recovery can critically diminish their physical, mental and spiritual health.
 
 The Relational Medicine Foundation aims to launch an art intervention program that allows patients – through art and creative pursuits – to keep them optimistic through their recovery. Patients spend such long periods of time in the hospital due to their Heart Disease, and providing them with an opportunity to express their emotions creatively would be invaluable to their mental and physical health to ultimately decrease the Heart Failure burden. We hope that our project will serve as a model to other medical centers. It is in our vision to support future research that will advance Heart Failure knowledge and care.","A broad range of communities have a stake in the effectiveness of our healthcare system in the patient healing process. A barrier we expect to overcome lies in the involvement of the community in the development of a research team that engages the patients, family members, or the caregivers to feel as partners in the expansion of this project, including representatives of the population of interest. This refers to the meaningful involvement of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders throughout the research process—from topic selection through design and conduct of research to dissemination of research results. The research team will participate in the development of behavioral incentives for patients, studying the effects on Patients’ access to care, coordination of care across healthcare settings, and in the development of an effective qualitative method of measuring the Health Care Outcomes of our project to establish further mechanisms of grant funding.","Dr. Federica Raia, a complexity scientist and assistant professor in the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, has extensive experience evaluating the impact of ethnographic work and the analysis of recorded medical encounters following patients with their doctor encounters for two years, and she has provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the practice of the patient-doctor collaboration in high-tech modern medicine. With Dr. Mario Deng, Professor Raia has established the Relational Medicine Foundation.
 To measure community level impact of using the arts to aid patients in their journey of healing and to educate patients about preventative measures, we will work with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health to develop questionnaires further distributed to the community electronically. The questionnaires could be distributed to community members through an app developed to display the patients’ work.","Organizations conducting similar research of humanism in medicine, such as the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, also focus on the patient perspective and the patient-practitioner relationship. The Myocarditis Foundation, established by a previous patient of Dr. Deng’s, is dedicated to providing accurate and up-to-date information to medical professionals, patients and their families, and to the scientific advancement of both the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The uniqueness of the Relational Medicine Foundation and its approach of the Relational Medicine Theory lies in the way of practicing medicine that maintains the basic human right of personhood, not only for the patients, but – in order to really help their patients- for health care professionals as well. It doesn’t divide the person from the body. It integrates personhood, body, science, and technology. In this framework, doctors interact with patients in a different way. They don’t separate medical talk and [personal] talk. Everything is intertwined because the doctors grow particularly attuned to the need of this integration and understand that a patient has to own the situation – it is their heart, their life. If they do not have a sense of ownership, they do not survive. 
 Relational Medicine also focuses on the relational web that binds physical things, the machines and persons together into a meaningful whole, and reconstituting the patient’s identity. The theory is that viewing the patient from the biomedical perspective is not sufficient. Dr. Raia and Dr. Deng have analyzed the recorded patient-doctor discourse in their consecutive encounters over a period of up to two years, an expert advanced heart failure cardiologist creates a meaningful path together with the patient to operate what we call a transformation. In the medical encounter, transformation manifests, for example, in emergence of the patient-doctor dyad becoming of fundamental importance to both patient and doctor and continually protected by the doctor. Together, patient and doctor create a safe space where in all that has broken down in this specific patient’s life, the role of the health care professional is to help this person start making sense of her/his life, and start coping with things in the world in her/his own way as the world starts becoming familiar again. In this process, a transforming identity becomes recognizable to the patient. Integrating this new way of being is very important in relational medicine.","The Relational Medicine Foundation evolved as a multistakeholder project in New York City (since 2009) and Los Angeles (since 2011). It is this opportunity that our foundation is addressing and for which we request funding to: 1) support the Foundation, 2) endow a UCLA-Fellowship “Humanism in Advanced Heart Failure”, 3) endow a Chair in “Humanism in High-Tech Modern Medicine”, and 4) endow the RelationalAct Research and Education (RARE) Program/Center/Institute at UCLA.

It is this opportunity that our foundation is addressing and for which we request funding to: 1) support the Foundation, 2) endow a UCLA-Fellowship “Humanism in Advanced Heart Failure”, 3) endow a Chair in “Humanism in High-Tech Modern Medicine”, and 4) endow the RelationalAct Research and Education (RARE) Program/Center/Institute at UCLA. In Dr. Raia’s research, she has uncovered that you do not just repeat what you have heard or what has been taught to you, you make it your own. And as you own it, it changes, it is yours. Our goal is to support the Relational Medicine Theory concept of owning the experience through this vehicle of the patient art therapy project that we have been propelling forward. It has been thus far a collaboration between UCLA student volunteers, Marymount High School, the Santa Monica Dept. of Art, UCLA students, UCLA professors, and UCLA physician-scientists. Since our program relies on student-based volunteer work, a total of $10,000 will be necessary for our collaborations per institution with various institutions. Funding will also be used in order to develop predominantly qualitative metrics to measure our program success on both a patient and community level using Dr. Raia’s research methods. Additionally, funding could be used for collaborations with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.","a. $100.000 will most likely be close to sufficient to cover the costs of the goals we have established for the next 12 months. In order to raise awareness in the media and in the community about the arts therapy project and the Foundation, we may require additional funding (please see the example article: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303795304576452140505285416.) Many additional costs would be covered by future UCLA Spark Crowdsourcing campaigns. Through a previous UCLA Spark Crowdsourcing campaign, we were able to gain support from our immediate community and raise $10,000 (please see: https://spark.ucla.edu/project/534704cb0920657409de158d.) Additional costs may also be covered through private donations. If the relationship and communication between healthcare providers and patients could be improved by the use of the principles of Relational Medicine Theory, 1) patient preferences would be taken more seriously and satisfaction with health care providers could be greatly enhanced 2) higher quality care with improved outcomes would be delivered to the entire patient population 3) the reduction in medical errors and the subsequent human and monetary benefits could be staggering and, thus, 4) cost-effectiveness in the entire health system would be enhanced. Current strategies are falling short of reaching these goals and it is this opportunity that our foundation, as a catalyst, is addressing and for which we request support.","a. The first step we would like to take in the Relational Medicine Foundation project in incorporating use of the arts as a healing tool in medicine is in the development of the arts therapy program. Because the program will rely on a primarily volunteer basis, as already discussed with UCLA Volunteer Services, consisting of patient volunteers, students, and a few paid licensed art therapists, we request an additional $50,000 to kickstart the program. $8,000 of this amount will cover the art supplies necessary (sketchbooks, canvases, paints, easels etc.). $12,000 will be allotted to compensating the art therapists. $5,000 will be necessary to compensate the administrative assistants we have been in contact with at the UCLA Heart & Lung Transplant Center. $5,000 will be necessary for the development of behavioral incentives for patients, with the help of the UCLA East-West Centers and the Mindful Awareness Center, also in close collaboration with the Hammer museum. In order to begin to transform the relationship between a healthcare professional and patient into a patient-doctor collaboration, using art as a tool of patient empowerment and mindfulness, we aim to raise awareness in the media about our project through a 3 to 4 minute documentary, utilizing $10,000 in expenses. $5,000 will be used to fund a Social Media expert to further expedite the success of the project and discover further mechanisms for funding. Additionally, $10,000 will be used to set up a performance at UCLA raising awareness for the project’s cause (please see: http://dailybruin.com/2012/05/03/patientphysician_dynamic_get_dramatic_treatment_in_emotion_theater_project_performances/ .) Relational Medicine Consortiums around the City of Los Angeles can integrate these performances, as well as research, into community outreach about utilizing a new approach in high tech modern medicine. $30,000 total would be allotted to three consortiums in the upcoming year. An additional $10,000 will be necessary to develop a mechanism for stimulating discussion about the project on the Relational Medicine website and to outreach to perspectives of patients and medical leaders worldwide.","Findings from a study released in 2010 by the Society of Actuaries indicate that measurable medical errors cost the US economy $19.5 billion in 2008, such that of the approximately $80 billion in cost related to medical injuries, 25% were the result of preventable medical errors. However, current strategies, while improving the situation, are conceptually falling short of reaching the goal of strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. The systematic patient information delivery and patient empowerment requires a more radical conceptual approach of changing the role distribution between healthcare provider and patient to consultant (healthcare provider) and empowered decision-maker (Patient). The success of the project proposed will be determined through Dr. Raia’s encounter research and through questionnaires provided to patients pre- and post- the art therapy program experiences. Additionally, as the project aims to provide communities with cutting edge research results and preventative measures to decrease knowledge gaps in disparities in the healthcare system, differences in disease instance and patient knowledge measured by hired implementation staff using public health research methods can aid in determining the success of the project of establishing an arts therapy program. Relational practices are therefore of fundamental importance, not only for future health care professionals but also to the students in UCLA’s Department of Education. Based on this, Dr. Raia designed a course based on this research, in which their book will be the required text. This coming fall, Dr. Raia and Dr. Deng will be teaching the UCLA course “Educational Perspectives of Relational Practices in Modern Medicine,” and thus, involvement in of the future generation of students in this project across the City of Los Angeles additionally determine the success of this project. This would only be possible with your support. Your donation will forward our goals by supporting our movement to identify a better process that will include patients’ perspective more fully into clinical practice, support the dissemination of research results to reduce disparities that create knowledge gaps in medical encounters, and create a humanistically more powerful framework for high-tech modern medicine."
5102109,Reunifying children with their incarcerated parents in prisons throughout California,2015071,,,Get On The Bus would like to expand our pilot Camp Suzanne restorative justice summer camp program for children and their incarcerated parents taking place inside prison walls. This weeklong camp was successfully piloted during the summer of 2015 for 12 children and their mothers at the Federal Correctional Institution-Dublin Facility. Our goal is to offer the camp to a greater number of children and add a much-needed art therapy component.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Get On The Bus CREATES a Los Angeles that fosters inclusivity and diversity through opportunities for children of the incarcerated. Through no fault of their own, the children we serve, often called “the silent victims of crime,” enter into a lifetime of challenges once their parents are incarcerated. Through healing opportunities like Camp Suzanne, we help build a better LA by caring for the children that need it most, while also contributing to better post-release outcomes and lower rates of recidivism for their incarcerated parents. 
 
 
 Today, there are more children in the United States who have an incarcerated parent than are diagnosed with autism or juvenile diabetes. Sadly, over 60% of mothers and fathers are sentenced to prisons more than 100 miles away from their families. In California, 60% of all female inmates are from Southern California, but a majority of women inmates are in prisons in Northern California, including the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla and Folsom Women’s Facility. Support from our organization goes far beyond transportation, allowing for truly transformative moments of healing between parent and child and impacting systematic change by CREATING a community of support for these children. Because our programs are built on community organizing and volunteers, our work extends an opportunity for all LA residents to help CREATE a brighter future for these “silent victims” and, as a result, a better future for LA through successful family reunification after incarceration. 
 
 A five-year study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Corrections found that offenders who were visited in prison were significantly less likely to return to prison, with a 13% decrease in felony reconvictions and a 25% decrease in re-incarceration on technical violations. The study also found that visits from family members, mentors and friends have the highest impact on lowering the recidivism rate, and that the more visits prisoners received, the lower their chance of re-offending after release. Investing in family relationships may be the best investment our society can make in CREATING a better Los Angeles by directly lowering post release crime rates and reforming the correctional system.","One of the obstacles involved in hosting a prison camp are the logistics and clearance to run a successful camp within the prisons. We continue to overcome this challenge through ongoing relationships with the prisons staff. After launching the first successful camp at the Federal Correction Institution-Dublin Facility this past summer, we are confident that we will continue to gain support of our in-prison programming and even expand our effort to more prisons. Another challenge is the emotional support that the children campers require after such a unification experience with their parents due to years of separation. Our plan to increase support for the emotional “unpacking” involves adding greater levels of on-site child therapy and partnering with local universities to integrate art-therapy.","Get On The Bus will measure the impact of Camp Suzanne quantitatively and qualitatively. Our quantitative data will include: Number of Children Served; Number of Mothers and Fathers participating; Number of Guardians participating; Number of Buses and Bus Teams; and Number of Volunteers. Qualitatively, we survey children, guardians, mothers and Local Area Teams to assess our strengths and weaknesses so that we can improve the program every year with analysis of the surveys.
 
 We recently completed an extensive evaluation report titled ""Examining the Impact of Re-Uniting Incarcerated Women with their Children."" The 3 year report, funded by The California Endowment, was conducted by the Lloyd Society and led by Project Director Nina Messina, a UCLA evaluation expert working on correctional justice issues. We are utilizing this evaluation to improve the structure of Get On The Bus and will continue to work with the Lloyd Society in evaluating program progress and overall impact.","Get On The Bus and Camp Suzanne are the only programs of their kind, for female inmates, in California. Camp Suzanne will be modeled after the highly successful Camp Hope prison summer camp, offered by the nonprofit organization Hope’s House in Washington DC. The 15 year-old Camp Hope summer program operates in 11 federal prisons in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, the District of Colombia and West Virginia and serves over 900 children of incarcerated parents. Activist and Hope House founder, Carol Fennelly, has shared some of Camp Hope’s program and assessment methods as a starting framework for Camp Suzanne.","GOTB partners with 40 different faith communities, hundreds of volunteers and 12 prisons throughout the state of California. Our relentless effort to serve children of the incarcerated requires ongoing collaboration with other restorative justice organizations to strengthen our collective efforts to serve all those affected by crime and the criminal justice system. We currently collaborate with Healing Hearts, Restoring Hope (HHRH) and look forward to expanding our efforts with HHRH and other agencies to share organizational experience and identify areas of programmatic intersection that could strengthen our individual missions. In expanding Camp Suzanne, GOTB will partner with local universities to provide expertise and graduate school interns as art therapists. The grant will be fully utilized by CRJW to expand Camp Suzanne.","The cost will be $100,000 to expand the program this summer. Future expansion will be covered by community fundraising efforts and additional grant funding. As a grassroots organization, Get On The Bus raises 80% of its program funds from community events.

 2) Parents receiving a visit are 13-25% less likely to re-offend following re-entry (longitudinal studies in Minnesota and Florida document decreased recidivism rates as a result of even one visit from a family member, mentor or clergy).
 3) Volunteers and the general public will have a greater appreciation for the plight of children with a parent in prison and may be more receptive to restorative justice-based reforms.

5102299,San Gabriel Mountains Forever: Increasing Public Access to Our Local Mountains,2015198,,,The San Gabriel Mountains make up 70% of LA County’s open space. We want people from park-poor communities to have access to the mountains. We will develop a transit-to-trails pilot program to identify socioeconomic gaps in access to the San Gabriels and to demonstrate how people can reach the mountains via public transit.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Through the research we will identify one more park-poor community in LA City,Live,"The San Gabriel Mountains rise above Los Angeles, stretching from Santa Clarita to San Bernardino county, and act as the recreational backyard for more than 17 million Southern Californians. In 2014, President Obama recognized their value and created the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The mountains make up 70% of LA County’s open space and provide us with more than one-third of our drinking water. 
 
 A shortage of urban open space, combined with the region’s obesity, diabetes, and asthma crises, positions these mountains as an essential recreational space. Despite their proximity to millions of people, the San Gabriels are not accessible to many LA County residents because of socioeconomic barriers. The limited public transit options and shortage of multilingual information make it difficult for some communities to learn that the mountains are there for public use and enjoyment. Without remedying these barriers, residents without cars will continue to lack access to this incredible place.
 
 We want residents from all walks of life to enjoy the San Gabriels. Therefore, we propose a pilot that will get people from underserved communities to the mountains. The project will consist of research to identify the neighborhoods that would benefit the most from visiting and learning about the San Gabriels. We will then identify locations in the forest that could be easily accessed for recreation as well as potential public transit routes for getting there. Next, we will select three communities to participate. Through public engagement and education, we will invite residents from these communities to attend an outing to the San Gabriel Mountains on free shuttle buses. The shuttle service will allow people with no cars and few monetary resources to spend a day in the mountains. All information we gather will be multilingual and widely distributed both to participants and to the greater public through our promotoras network and online social media engagement. 
 
 We anticipate finding gaps in public transit routes and options to the San Gabriel Mountains. This is important because we will take this information back to public officials and leaders to highlight the need for a transit-to-trails type program such as weekend shuttles to the mountains. We will enlist the participants to help us advocate for increased access through policy. Thus our project will address the environmental justice issue of disparate access to open space in Los Angeles County.","We anticipate that our greatest challenge will be finding public transit routes and options for all people (not just from the three chosen pilot communities) to visit and recreate in the San Gabriel Mountains. To overcome this obstacle, we will work with local transportation officials and public leaders to introduce policies that address the lack of recreational access to the San Gabriel Mountains.","We will evaluate our work through interview-based feedback from participants. Our interview protocol will ask both qualitative and quantitative questions to best determine the public opinion of transit-to-trails and to identify barriers to accessing the monument. Data from interviews will help us identify the barriers to access, possible bridges to access, the value of the mountains to the public, and how to improve transit-to-trails, and best produce multilingual information for diverse communities.
 
 After the pilot is over, we will also conduct follow-up interviews with participants to determine if they have since visited the mountains, why or why not, and if they see a need for Transit-to-Trails. In addition to interviewing pilot participants, we will interview non-participants to identify unanticipated barriers to access.","COFEM along with the San Gabriel Mountains Forever Coalition is the only entity doing work to address the lack of access to the San Gabriel Mountains. The Santa Monica Mountains at one point had a transit-to-trails program but it is no longer active. 
 
 Our project is the first to connect park-poor, underserved communities to the mountains via public transit options. Not only do we intend to connect residents to the national monument, we will also provide information about using public transit to visit the mountains and about recreational opportunities (trails, picnic site, ranger stations, restrooms, etc...) once in the monument. 
 
 Furthermore, we will intentionally design our project so it can be exported to other communities. We envision our project as a case study that can be emulated- at the grassroots level- in metropolitan areas outside of Los Angeles.","The following organizations are a part of the San Gabriel Mountains Forever Coalition and will be our partners in this project: Amigos de los Rios, Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Community Hiking Club, The City Project, San Gabriel Valley Bike Coalition, Sierra Club and The Wilderness Society. Partners will charge time and expenses to COFEM.",We think the total project will cost about $100k,"Buses/Shuttles: $10,000

This new SBC arts center, the first of its kind on the LA Waterfront, will appeal to all generations and be accessible to people of all income levels. Our shared goal is to engage youth and seniors in arts and sustainability through a program of exhibitions and workshops that emphasize community, connection and the exchange of ideas between people of all backgrounds and ages.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, South Bay",Learn,"South Bay Contemporary (SBC), a non-profit arts organization dedicated to building the arts in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, has a 10 year track record of putting on great exhibitions and related classes. SBC is now developing membership and community programs, and seeks to bridge cultural and generational divides through arts education.
 
 SBC will use this grant to provide a high quality, multi-generational arts experience for children, families and seniors throughout the South Bay. Arts and creativity is a critical part of human development, enabling children and adolescents to mature into functional, productive adults that are able to think creatively and solve problems. Tragically, arts programs have been drastically cut from many school curriculums, and low-income families are disproportionally affected due to limited low- or no-cost arts activities. For seniors, the process of observing and making art offers a wide range of health benefits and enhances imagination and creativity, helping them to realize their unique, unlived potential; but unfortunately there is a lack of high-quality art programs available to low-income seniors.
 
 SBC plans to build a 3,000 sq ft exhibition and learning space at CRAFTED at the Port of Los Angeles, a vibrant 26,000 sq. ft. arts and crafts marketplace on the LA Waterfront in San Pedro, featuring the work of more than 50 resident artists and craftspeople. The market provides an opportunity for a culturally, geographically and creatively diverse population of artists to share and sell their work with the public.
 
 SBC plans to further that mission and help realize the vision of CRAFTED as a creative campus on the LA Waterfront. SBC’s goal for collaborating with CRAFTED is to join with an established creative community to offer a unique arts education program.
 
 Programs offered in the new exhibition/education space will have two components: thought-provoking exhibitions focused on environmental sustainability and storytelling; and hands-on intergenerational arts workshops led by major Los Angeles artists. SBC already has commitments from Tracy Weiss, who is well known for her work with recycled plastics (http://www.zhibit.org/traceyweiss); Hyung Mo Lee, Dawn Ertl (http://dawnertl.tumblr.com) and found object artist and SBC co-founder Ben Zask. We will offer a minimum of 6 major exhibitions and a series of workshops, complemented by a regular program of activities led by SBC staff and artists.","The LA Waterfront is owned by the City of Los Angeles, and managed by its Board of Harbor Commissioners and the Harbor Department - the Port of Los Angeles. Our shared overarching mission is to connect Angelenos to their waterfront. However, due to its geographically remote location at the southernmost tip of LA at the end of a narrow corridor of land formed along the 110 freeway, many LA Waterfront destinations (including CRAFTED) struggle to bring a critical mass of visitors to their locations. For that reason, we will work with and through our partners to and organize our offering as part of their program of service, and make it available to an existing audience. 
 
 We plan to focus on the South Bay, and we will partner with Anderson Senior Centers (a program of City of LA Parks and Rec), Boys and Girls Clubs in the South Bay and the Harbor Community Benefit Foundation to reach our target audiences. SBC has existing partnerships with these organizations.","We estimate that in this one-year pilot program, we can provide half-day, intensive arts workshops led by a working artist for 960 children and seniors, and expose approximately 180,000 individuals and families to the SBC special exhibitions and smaller-scale arts activities at CRAFTED. We will know that we are successful if we are able to provide our program to our anticipated numbers; and if we are able to assist LA2050 in its goal of increasing the number of households in LA that have participated in the arts through engagement with an arts/cultural institution.
 
 Through this program, SBC will create mentorship opportunities for young interns and volunteers to develop leadership skills. This program should create six paid internship opportunities and help these young adults become permanently employed in the arts. 
 
 We will also evaluate our work based on number of new SBC memberships, grant awards and donation contributions, sales of art objects and increased visitors.","Angels Gate Cultural Center is also located in San Pedro and is run by the City of Los Angeles, Parks and Recreation Dept. Located near Pt Fermin, the property was formerly an Army barracks and is there are 52 artist studios an art gallery and various educational spaces.
 
 AGCC is in a beautiful, naturalistic setting, and does great work curating exhibits and working in schools. They have a waiting list for their studios and are in a less accessible location from the rest of the city of San Pedro and the harbor. We feel that there is a need for both locations and they appeal in different ways.
 
 While many organizations share our concern about cuts in arts education, and many are working to restore some form of arts education in LA neighborhoods, we believe that this will be the only non-profit arts education program that intends to provide an intergenerational experience, offering the opportunity for rich dialogue, human connection and storytelling. We feel that this project supports LA 2050 Connect metrics, in a unique way not only by providing a cultural experience, but also social and emotional support for seniors through the opportunity to connect with each other and youth.","SBC will partner with CRAFTED to secure the space at a reduced rate that’s affordable for SBC under the terms of the grant. CRAFTED will receive $20,000 of the grant in rent for the space. Because the SBC facility will locate within CRAFTED’s existing space, the cost of build out is minimal.
 
 Anderson Senior Center, located a few miles from CRAFTED is currently in transition. They have a new director and in the process of brainstorming ways to bring new activities and programs to the center. 
 
 About Harbor Community Benefit Foundation Harbor Community Benefit foundation supports programs that have a positive effect on the environment of the harbor communities. In the past, they have supported our focus on projects that address the environment and bring in art exhibitions and workshops that promote sustainability.
 
 About Boys and Girls Club of Wilmington and San Pedro The Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro has a history of growing support from the community and have a well developed Arts Academy as well as support for academics. They actively take children to cultural destinations for enrichment and the workshops at CRAFTED will add to their nearby options .

5102311,SBSM Healthy Tomorrow Initiative,2015206,,,"$100,000 will supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness centers, the SBSM curriculum and professional development training for the school’s physical education department. Following an eight-week implementation of the SBSM Curriculum, we expect to improve student passing rates by a minimum 25% on the Fitnessgram assessment (California State proficiency test for student physical fitness) as well as improve student’s perception of fitness and exercise at these high schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0CreatePlayLive,"According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 42 percent of our children are obese or overweight. The problem is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities where there is a lack of safe outdoor play space and an abundance of fast food restaurants.
 
 Unfortunately, with average Physical Education budgets of only $500, LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for the recreational and fitness resources their neighborhoods lack. In fact, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the most frequently cited barriers to physical activity opportunities for students are resources, time, and staff capacity. There are 350 middle and high schools in LAUSD, of which SBSM currently serves 95. This leaves over 200 schools in our local district alone without effective physical fitness resources.
 
 SBSM confronts this problem with an innovative approach, providing low-income schools in need of fitness resources with a comprehensive physical education package to promote the lifelong values of exercise and active living. A grant from L.A. 2050 will help supply two LAUSD high schools with state-of-the-art fitness centers, the SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training for the school’s physical education department.
 
 Each new fitness center includes a selection of commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid cycles, spin bikes and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility ladders. 
 
 In addition, each new school receives the Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum and professional development training. The Sound Body Sound Mind Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and methodologies for motivating students. The Curriculum provides 36 age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses the research and theories that inform them.
 
 Once trained, teachers can empower their students to develop competence and confidence in a variety of fitness activities. Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus enabling them to maintain fit and healthy lifestyles into adulthood.","When going in to LAUSD middle and high schools, one of the biggest obstacles that SBSM faces is a lack of dedication from school faculty to the new fitness center and a lack of focus on improving physical education at the school. In order to have a successful program implementation, we need the entire staff on board with the initiative to make sure that these fitness centers will be used to their full potential. Not only the P.E. department, but the principle, assistant principles, as well as all other teachers at the school need to embrace the program and aid in it's effectiveness for years to come. To ensure that this happens, we make each school go through an application and interview process. The process increases buy-in from the potential grantees, allows us to make sure that the school has the proper backing from the administration, and shows us whether the school is in need of the fitness center both demographically and fiscally.","Following installation of the fitness centers and completion of the teacher trainings, each school implements the SBSM curriculum for an eight-week period in their classes for a minimum of 100 students. Before and after the eight-week program, we require each physical education staff to collect student Fitnessgram data for the 100 students. The Fitnessgram is a state-mandated test that measure fitness levels in students, and for our purposes, evaluates the overall impact of SBSM programming and curriculum on student health. Along with the Fitnessgram we require the physical education staff to collect survey data measuring student attitudes toward exercise, body image, and fitness knowledge. After collection of the two sets of data, we conduct comparative analysis of the pre and post fitness center and curriculum implementation.","There are organizations doing similar work in childhood obesity prevention such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI) and UCLA Fit For Healthy Weight. We have great relationships with both of these nonprofit organizations, and they have both done amazing things for the Los Angeles community. We constantly look to collaborate with both organizations to best serve the students of LAUSD, and each organization has a unique approach on how they go about aiding in the improvement of children's health. One of the biggest values of SBSM's model is sustainability. Because we are giving schools an entire state-of-the-art fitness center and corresponding curriculum, we are giving them a fixed-cost investment that will last for years with minimal extra cost. Students whose outlets for fitness are sometimes non-existent in low-income areas are able to use the fitness center as much as they want and adapt physical fitness into their daily lives for long into the future. In order to ensure upkeep of our centers, our vendors provide 5-year warranties for all fitness equipment, and after the 5-year period, schools are eligible to apply for $5,000 worth of maintenance. Although both YPI and UCLA Health are both fantastic organizations, most of their initiatives involve manpower, onsite professional help, or research that does not necessarily go entirely to students. Our transparent model allows us to see direct results from our students, and the effects last for years after our first contact with the schools without much extra cost out of pocket.","SBSM will collaborate with UCLA Health, LAUSD, and a UCLA student-led volunteer corps. UCLA Health will provide medical expertise along with advanced research practices in order to refine the program, LAUSD will provide logistical support during the fitness center implementation process, and the UCLA student-led volunteer corps will ensure the curriculum instruction and data collection are effectively delivered for the hybrid program. All $100,000 of grant awards will go to the Sound Body Sound Mind Foundation, and we will designate that grant money toward equipment costs and building the two fitness centers at the LAUSD high schools.","The $100,000 will cover the entirety of the project. We have implemented 95 fitness centers within LAUSD over the last 15 years, and have maximized our cost-effectiveness in getting the program and fitness centers installed as efficiently as possible.","Budget for SBSM Fitness Centers (Per School)
 
 Commercial-Grade Fitness Equipment (Strength and Cardio Exercise Machines) - $45,800.00
 
 Mobile Fitness Accessories (Jump ropes, Agility Ladders, Sandbells, Balls, etc.) - $3,500

 SBSM Curriculum Books (4 Books) - $300.00
 
 Total Expenses (Per School) - $50,000
 
 Total Project Expenses (All Schools) - $100,000","SBSM has tried to make scalable program that can be implemented at almost any middle or high school by making the program consistent yet flexible. Class sizes, student abilities, student behaviors, and the amount of space that a school is able to allot for a fitness center varies enormously from school to school. Giving each school the ability to tailor their fitness center to the school’s needs gives a larger sense of ownership for the school, as well as a more effective use of the fitness equipment and program. This is one of the reasons why SBSM has grown to impact over 92,000 students per year with our 95 fitness centers in LAUSD. With the help of the L.A. 2050 grant, SBSM will be able to expand our reach in LAUSD even further."
5102317,School is Cool initiative,2015211,,,"Our ""School is Cool"" initiative is designed to help our community receive all they need to create a base of knowledge, a love of education, and adopt the tools needed to thrive in and out of the classroom. We make attendance at school a priority and promote academic excellence to all students. By teaching students to value the importance of education, we aim to increase their overall interest while helping to bridge the gap between the educational inequities that currently exist.",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,ALL,"Our “School is Cool” initiative is a prime example of how to positively influence and encourage at-risk students to value education! Along with our programs targeted to motivate ALL students to achieve academic success, we reach out to the entire community promoting the importance of building a positive school environment. This, in turn, promotes academic achievement with the end result of high school graduation, college and career readiness. 
 
 So far, our program has demonstrated significant improvements in Proficient/Advanced attendance rates at the school wide, K-12, level including both gender and ethnicity. Involving families and members of the community helps to create an overall excitement and buzz among the students and their schools! In the past, we've been able to donate laptops to students graduating from high school who pursue a college education and we have currently added a reward for perfect attendance with wireless tablets that are PERFECT for continued learning while away from school. Creating the desire to learn by providing opportunities for at-risk students to win cool prizes motivates our students to work hard and earn their reward with respect and dignity! 
 
 Thinking about Tomorrow is an organization committed to excellence and holding true to a clear vision and passion for delivering outstanding results with every effort we undertake. Over the years, we have proven the effectiveness of youth leadership development. Our community led programs, developed and managed by a community for a community, make a striking impact on our students. We believe in alternative education and youth leadership development, especially for those from underrepresented minority communities.","Any organization's main barrier when it comes to fully implementing a project is secruing the funds necessary to operate at full capacity. Every year, we’ve expanded our efforts to cover an increasing amount of students in schools, therefore, the need arises to find and secure additional funds! Additionally, as we progress through the year, student enrollment increases as students begin to attend school more often and qualify to join us in celebrating excellent and perfect attendance! Although that is a GREAT problem to have, it is still a problem that needs to addressed! One of the easiest ways for us to overcome this challenge is to create various online campaigns generating a source of income outside of the traditional grassroots efforts. As an example, we send out newsletters, promote via social media, and engage our community partners in helping to spread the message. Not only are we (directors and volunteers) out there collecting donations, but have friendly support nation wide.","Working directly with LAUSD's schools, counselors, and teachers allows us to maintain record of any given student's attendance in any school! We track progress daily, weekly, monthly and annually as students' attendance rates progressively increase. Tying this metric of measurement to the students that receive backpacks with school supplies provides further proof of our program's success. 
 
 It is only through the collaboration of many, that the relationships we've built with the schools, students and their families will have the most impact. We want to make school a fun and safe place, not a place that our students dread. We strive to provide a place that feels like ""home away from home."" TaT aims to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. The more students attend school regularly, the easier their transitions will become between elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school, and high school into college and eventually into a career!","The difference between Thinking about Tomorrow and the similar other organizations that promote the improvement of our educational system is that they focus solely on one single aspect. However, the problem is, these organizations can't build a pyramid without the base! A pyramid isn't complete without it's pointy top! We, at TaT, understand that to see effective change we must focus on the overall picture, figure out the underlying causes and address both issues with proper solutions. We strive to see the base, the tip, and everything in the middle of the pyramid. Our programs are designed to target all involved parties - students, teachers, schools, communities, AND families! Most of similar organizations only focus on one aspect and not the whole. Of course, one of the positive aspects about other organizations that do similar work are the opportunities to work with each other to ensure all children have the best opportunities to learn to love and value their education.","Over the years, TaT has established many community partners along the way, but none have been as integral to the success of our School is Cool initiative as the Los Angeles Dodgers, Keystone Press, Build-a-Bear, Wal-Mart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread. Together, we have built a solid foundation around shared values focused on improving our communities today, for tomorrow.
 
 Our partnership with the LA Dodgers creates a huge opportunity for at risk students as well as their families! Through our program, students with excellent and perfect attendance throughout the year are invited to Dodger Stadium to enjoy a day at the ballpark. Free tickets for the family, $10 vouchers to be used for (food), hats, pennants and tshirts provide the ultimate experience for our students and their families! This past year, we celebrated attendance with over 20,000 at-risk students in 28 of LAUSD's schools.
 
 Keystone Press is another highly significant partnership that provides TaT with our perfect and excellent attendance certificates given to students for consistent attendance. Keystone also provides the certificates of appreciation and all other promotional materials for TaT, including brochures and one-sheet printouts. In total, we've handed out over 50,000 certificates for attendance!
 
 Partnerships with Build-a-Bear, Walmart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread help get students excited about coming to school EVERYDAY! Through our partnership with these organizations, our program challenges our students weekly, monthly, and annually by providing constant motivation through various in-kind and monetary donations. These businesses provide a wide variety of incentives and rewards for each student eligible by simply going to school!
 
 Above all, one of the most critical factors to the success of our organization's message is the ability to reach as many members of our community as possible. It is often difficult to offset the costs of promotional advertising and we are grateful to our sponsors who provide opportunities to help cover the costs of such materials.","Roughly, our project costs $50,000; as we expand and more students qualify, our costs will increase.","Below is our ""School is Cool"" initiative budget!

 > ""Back to School"" Supply Drive:
 *Our yearly goal is to collect 500 backpacks filled with an ENTIRE school year of school supplies. Th","To achieve desired results to any give task, communication and goals must be clear and direct. One must not assume that all involved parties know what is expected. This is not realistic. Communication is an important key factor when it comes to executing a project or event. When all parties are not on the same page, it takes longer for the goal to be achieved.
 
 Working with the entire community can be a daunting task. Often times, unlimited amounts of pressure build, especially when thousands of students and their families are trusting TaT to come through! The advantage of our programming is that we make communication a priority. Communication between the schools and students as well as their families, along with communication between commercial and residential representatives is imperative to a smoothly functioning program. We have learned that it is the disconnection between the members of the community that halt further advancement and success of our programs. However, creating an opportunity for the entire community to celebrate each other builds an unbreakable bond amongst all members of the community!
 
 Additionally, we have learned that people, not just children, need to be excited about learning. Modern technology has both excelled our civilization beyond belief while at the same time has prevented many from eventually reaching their full potential. For many, it has ruined their ability to interact socially and has increased behavioral anxiety. While we realize that we award students at the end of the year with free wifi tablets that can often perpetuate the lack of social behavior, we also realize the tablet's amazing motivating factors for children and we strive to provide our students with the education needed to learn how to use it with moderation. 
 
 So, while we ""incentivize"" and get our students excited about going to school everyday, we also give them to the tools needed for success in both school and life! We establish within each student a solid foundation of values that are taken home to families and are carried with them forever. We believe that learning NEVER ends and getting people excited about valuing their education isn't just about improving attendance rates or graduation rates, it's about improving their future!"

It will be challenging to overcome the voter apathy experienced by millions of Angelenos, however, we believe it is a challenge worth facing considering the long-term dire consequences of a disinterested voting population. 
 
 We aim to address this serious challenge by partnering with past media partners like ABC, Univision, LA Times, NPR, and Twitter as well as organizations such as the League of Women Voters, California Common Cause, Rock the Vote and Head Count to distribute our content.","For the first time ever underserved voters will be able to: Quickly and easily understand ballot propositions that affect them; easily record thoughts on ballot propositions and establish reminders for specific voting dates; quickly share thoughts with friends in Los Angeles and other interested parties through established social networks.
 
 How We Measure Success:
 ➢ Build Relationships Through Digital/Social:
 • Attract -> Convert -> Support -> Extend
 ➢ Measure Effectiveness of Campaign through Impressions -> Leads -> Conversions -> Loyalty/Engagement
 
 We want to meet our brand awareness goal by engaging at least 5% of California registered voters, which equals approximately 890,000 people, mostly in the Los Angeles region. 
 
 Metric Goals
 Web: 50k monthly unique visits
 Social Media/Emails: 50k+ Database
 Video Impressions: 1M+ video impressions
 Widgets Distributed: 50+
 Widget Impressions: 500k+","A few providers exist that communicate nonpartisan information about ballot proposition. They are competitors in the sense that they provide information. However, the websites rely mostly on text to get their messages across and prove to be dull user experience platforms. Then there are of course highly biased political advertisements which air ad nauseam for months leading to Election Day.
 
 First and foremost, it is the CA Secretary of State and LA County Clerks responsibly to gather and disseminate “Voter Guides” to every registered voter. Most are familiar with the drab grey volumes of voter information that gets delivered to the mailbox a month before Election Day. This guide is chock full of information but requires hours of studying to decipher the legalese. Ballotpedia.org provides well-balanced information regarding each ballot proposition, but all the information is text-heavy. The League of Women Voters has been the gold standard for providing unbiased information to voters for nearly a century. Not only is the League’s work complimentary to our own, but also their board of directors voted unanimously to partner with SeePolitical.
 
 SeePolitical’s advantages include:
 1. Technology - the depth of technologies custom built, specifically the capabilities of our social media search and analytics technologies far exceed anything remotely close to being available to competitors. We are also on the cutting edge of application and mobile development to be able to reach our consumers at any touch point. Our technologies are proven and earn us a significant competitive advantage while creating an initial barrier to entry for future competition.
 2. Design - the design of our content clusters allows users to easily interact with valuable content whether on their desktop, mobile phone or Facebook. 
 3. Function - our content clusters operate as independent tools, but give the ability to create profiles and socially interact with other users. Watch>Choose>Vote...hang out and learn from others.
 4. Not to brag, but we produce some of the best looking animations available.","We are in confidential discussions with three major universities located in Los Angeles to establish the first SeePolitical Institute on one of their campuses. Although we can't disclose the names of each school at this time to the public via this application form, we would be happy to explain directly to the Goldhirsh Foundation over the phone or in person.
 
 SeePolitical has been teaching a college course at the Otis College of Art and Design for the past two years and has created a model that has proven extremely successful:
 
 - It's a huge win for SeePolitical to be associated with a fine academic institutions and makes it easier for us to attract additional funding from major sponsors. 
 
 - The school benefits by offering an innovative service that combines academic research and analysis with beautiful content production...usually a difficult combination to forge, but not for us. 
 
 -And of course, the general public greatly benefits by finally having reliable access to information that will bolster interest about what's on the ballot, and help voters make educated decisions on Election Day. Not to mention how many high school social studies teachers use our content. 
 
 The entire $100,000 grant award would go to SeePolitical to help support the initial establishment of the first SeePolitical Institute.","It will cost approximately $250,000 to establish a SeePolitical Institute at one of these colleges/universities. The additional costs have already been pledged by individuals in Los Angeles, and the schools themselves.","SeePolitical is a Los Angeles based nonprofit organization with big dreams to eventually provide clarity of the electoral process for the rest of the nation. However, we understand that we need to walk before we can run. This initial $100,000 will allow the SeePolitical Institute to build capacity by hiring staff and remaining funds will be used to promote and market it's educational content for public consumption. 
 
 The genius of this model is that since the voter education content is continually produced by students for class credit, the usually absorbent costs for research and production for each animation is eliminated.","Establishing the first SeePolitical Institute in Los Angeles is just the beginning. We are creating a model for other states to adopt our program to provide nonpartisan information on state and local issues and elections. 
 
 SeePolitical will establish similar relationships with universities in all 50 states, by which their students enter our program or fellowship to research and explain the issues confronting their states' voters.

This new high school will be focused not only on cultivating and expressing academic achievement, but will be a place where students learn how their individual success can make a difference for their communities.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Sequoyah School, Pasadena-enrolling students from above areas.",Learn,"Sequoyah is establishing a new kind of high school situated in one of the most demographically diverse regions of the world, with a program focused on developing a student’s leadership skills to address social issues across cultural and economic contexts. The curriculum is informed by the principles of social entrepreneurship and attention to the skills needed to become successful in a 21st century global economy.
 
 The school’s purpose is to ignite and develop a student’s passion for service and social change. As part of their course of study, students attending Sequoyah will be challenged to identify and explore issues important to themselves and their communities, and will fulfill a requirement for the design of a viable proposal for solving a societal problem of their choosing. In doing so, students will have the opportunity to work alongside professionals experienced in the management of public, private and nonprofit organizations and they will acquire the skills, knowledge and determination to assume the responsibility of active citizenship and culturally competent leadership.
 
 The school intends to structure a learning environment that will guide adolescents in balancing ambitious academic achievement with patience, persistence and equanimity. The past few decades of theory and research in educational psychology underscore the importance of non-cognitive skills, dispositions or habits for learning. Students who are coached in how to identify their own strengths and challenges, set realistic goals, use support systems and persevere, find greater long-term success as learners.",Sequoyah must attract sufficient numbers of students to a new independent high school that has not yet demonstrated success in college admissions. In order to allay perceptions of risk of enrolling in a new program the school has already engaged a respected and widely known high school college admissions counselor who can assure student applicants that the school's college-preparatory program will meet the demands of selective colleges and universities.,"In the years ahead Sequoyah will assess the experience of our alumni to determine if the school has fulfilled its purpose. To do so it will develop an alumni program that will keep our graduates involved and the school informed.
 It will also be important to understand the experience of our social innovation program partners to determine if our students are constructively engaged.Sequoyah will establish an administrative staff position to facilitate social innovation program partnerships and assess the effectiveness of community outreach. 
 In addition, Sequoyah’s board of trustees will annually evaluate the success of high school program. Their assessment will include among other concerns the following objectives: student enrollment goals – including metrics for socioeconomic diversity, recruitment goals for faculty and staff who fit mission and vision; summer institute enrollment and conference outreach ; college matriculation and financial sustainability.","Many colleges and universities are establishing interdisciplinary undergraduate entrepreneurship centers. Some are establishing summer programs directed towards recruiting high school students. A handful of high schools have started extracurricular programs that introduce social entrepreneurship. In contrast, Sequoyah will incorporate principles of social entrepreneurship, and 21st century skills: critical thinking, collaboration, communication and creativity, into every dimension of its program, and do so in a developmentally appropriate way for high school-age students. Such a beyond-the-self, purpose driven educational approach has been demonstrated to raise engagement and achievement levels across subject areas for adolescents from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds.","Sequoyah is benefiting from the partnership of the following individuals who are contributing their expertise to the design of the high school program: Mariana Amatullo, Art Center College of Design; Marie-Aimee Brajeux,social enterprise consultant;Lorena Garcia-Duran, Ashoka; Laura Gowen, Zest Finance;Nicholas Haan, Singularity University;Scott Sherman,Transformative Action Institute;Neela Rajendra, Claremont McKenna Kravis Leadership Institute;Cynthia Willard, Echoing Green.

5102084,Shes Got Skills: From Homelessness to Jobs,2015050,,,"DWC is seeking $100,000 from the Goldhirsh Foundation to support the expansion of our transitional employment program. DWC will place 10 women into paid employment through our two retail stores in downtown LA, for a period of 12 months, gaining hands-on work experience in customer service, food handling, drink making, inventory management, and retail.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Skid Row, Los Angeles",Learn,"DWC will make LA the best place to create by placing 10 women, who have histories of homelessness and trauma, into paid employment through our social enterprise, MADE by DWC. Through this program, women will have the opportunity to gain hands-on work experience, harness their own creativity in the workplace, and contribute to the diversification of LA’s business community. 
 
 In 2010, DWC launched its social enterprise to provide transferable skills-training to women who have the hardest time securing employment. Over the past five years, DWC has solidified its job-training program, providing women with 12-week courses in inventory management, retail sales, and café sales. 
 
 Last year, with funding from the LA2050 Grants Challenge, DWC established a coalition of socially conscious business partners, committed to employing women with histories of homelessness. As a result, DWC placed nearly 60 homeless and formerly homeless women into jobs. The program was an overwhelming success. DWC learned that for women who are job-ready, being placed into employment following a 12-week course or individualized case management sessions leads to long-term retention. However, for women who are not job-ready and are still coping with the effects of trauma, a more intensive and supportive program is essential. Thus, DWC will expand the current 12-week job training course into a 12-month transitional employment program, where women are employed in our two retail stores and compensated fairly. 
 
 In October of 2015, DWC will place its first cohort of five women into paid positions in our café and resale boutique. An additional five women will be placed in March of 2016. Women will be employed for 12 months in one of the following three positions: Café Associate, Resale Associate, and Inventory Associate. While working at DWC, participants will 1) receive industry-specific, high-quality training, 2) gain hands-on work experience, and 3) receive feedback on a monthly basis from a Case Manager. 
 
 Through this initiative, the aim is to prepare participants for future bridge and/or traditional employment opportunities. To secure future positions, participants will work with DWC’s Job Developer, who works closely with business partners in identifying opportunities and matching participants to those. Approximately three months before transitioning, each participant will be evaluated and scored against pre-determined job-readiness standards.","One major barrier that we anticipate is the housing status of our participants. DWC’s goal to house women is driven by a community-wide effort to house the most vulnerable first. Typically, this means that the women who became housed during the grant period are extremely vulnerable and not able to work. Concurrently, homeless women who would be more likely to obtain employment remain on housing waiting lists. This presents significant difficulties because the search for shelter remains primary in the daily lives of our participants. 
 
 To respond, DWC will provide comprehensive support to all participants enrolled in our transitional employment program. Each woman will have access to case management support; the opportunity to enroll in the Coordinated Entry System to secure housing, if she does not have housing; and linkage to any other services, as needed. DWC is committed to providing services to the hardest-to-serve population, and will maintain its low-barrier approach.","DWC’s project is one of six participating in the Los Angeles Regional Initiative for Social Enterprise (LA:RISE). As such, an external evaluation is being conducted by Social Policy Research Associate (SPR) to examine the impact of transitional employment services on program participants’ employment, earnings, and criminal justice involvement outcomes by comparing their outcomes with a control group, comprised of individuals eligible for, but not receiving, transitional employment services. 
 
 The program will be evaluated using a random assignment research design, meaning eligible individuals will be placed completely at random into either a program group (and receive all above-mentioned services) or into a control group (and not receive the transitional employment services). 
 
 Comparative outcomes will be tracked, interpreted, and analyzed by SPR.","As mentioned, DWC is one of six agencies providing either transitional, bridge, or traditional employment services to hard-to-serve populations. The effort is led by the city’s Workforce Development Department and REDF, and funded by the Department of Labor. 
 
 However, DWC is the only agency committed to exclusively serving women. That, in combination with our approach, render us unique in our community. The umbrella, evidence-based practice that we use is trauma-informed care. More than 70% of the women we serve at DWC have traumatic histories, and by acknowledging their trauma and incorporating this knowledge into all aspects of service-delivery, we create a culture of healing. Frequently, when survivors of trauma and violence re-enter the workplace, they are confronted with triggers that may remind them of past traumatizing events. In the 12-month transitional employment program, we will help our participants first identify those triggers, and then support them as they develop the skills to manage their trauma responses. This is essential to ensuring a woman’s long-term success. 
 
 We understand that each of our participants has unique needs and circumstances, which must be addressed through a comprehensive spectrum of services. Through our work, we recognize interconnectedness of the issues faced by our participants and have expanded and tailored our wide range of services to provide a holistic, systemic approach to meet their needs. This, along with the strong community organizing efforts that foster multi-sector partnerships, has helped us move from an understanding of the best practices in homeless service provision to a shared community commitment to implement them. We believe that this approach, along with our engagement in continuous research, learning, and innovation, will ensure our success in bringing an end to homelessness for women.","The two major partners in this city-wide initiative are the Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development Department and REDF. 
 
 The two are partnering with additional transitional employers, including, Chrysalis, CRCD Enterprise, Homeboy Industries, Goodwill SoCal, Weingart 360 Solutions, and LA Conservation Corps. The Department of Labor is contributing $6 million to the initiative, and DWC will receive $30,000.","For DWC, the total cost of the project is $376,983. Of that, $318,833 includes personnel expenses, including salaries and benefits; $53,300 includes wages for the participants, at $10.25/hr for 10 hours per week; and $4,850 includes operating costs, including materials, supplies, and other costs. 
 
 Thus far, DWC has received $30,000 from REDF to participate in the city-wide initiative, LA:RISE. We will cover additional costs by allocating a portion of the program-specific funds raised for our Job Readiness program to this project. We will continue to fundraise over the next 12 months to ensure all costs are full covered.","A $100, 000 grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation will cover the following expenses of the proposed project: $23,300 for participants wage; $3,029 for taxes and personnel-related expenses regarding participants’ wage; $71,171 for project staff’s salaries and expenses, including DWC’s Director of Vocational Education and Social Enterprise, Workforce Development Manager, Job Developer, and Social Enterprise Store Managers & Associates (that will include 26% fringe benefits for eligible staff); and lastly, $2,500 for program materials and supplies.","Following the evaluation conducted by SPR, DWC will develop a full implementation plan for scaling, based on recommendations from the report. We hope to elevate the best practices in job readiness for homeless and formerly homeless women. As a leader in the community and across the nation, we are prepared to advocate for the implementation of those best practices. 
 
 DWC is recognized as a leader in the service field. In 2001, we spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition in gathering information on homeless women’s needs with the potential to affect positive change in policy. In 2005, we developed a national study of best practices in homeless women’s services. In 2011, DWC was deemed “Organization of the Year” by the Los Angeles Business Journal and was granted the Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award. In 2013, we were named “Nonprofit of the Year,” by the Office of the Governor and California Volunteers."

Many people here who have the means, travel outside of our area to buy organic, healthy foods. That means the area suffers from retail leakage, money leaving the community. The community drives more than it should have to, to reach healthy food stores, increasing our carbon footprint. Some of our supporters travel by bus, taking as many as six buses to shop at Whole Foods.
 The South LA community deserves the same options in healthy eating as other parts of the city. 
 SoLA raises awareness in the South LA community around healthy eating practices. It is our practice to teach ways of addressing the diet related illnesses our community is plagued with, through fun events,nutrition classes, and workshops.
  SoLA will bring a strong sense of pride of ownership to our neighborhood and our member/owners. There has never been a beautiful full service health food store of the type we envision in this part of LA.
 As a cooperative, SoLA's profits will be distributed among it's members, further enriching this community.
  Instead of a food desert, SoLA will create an oasis, an oasis of accessibility, inclusion, self-sufficiency, health, nutritional education and economic empowerment.","Most healthy co-ops open with 800-1,000 members. Since our incorporation in 2014 we've seen how hard it is to sell the co-op memberships. While our list serv is nearly 1,700 subscribers, less than one tenth of those have actually become members. Our challenge is to reach more people and to reach those that are able to buy now. Resources from LA2050 will support an advertising and outreach campaign.The ad campaign will include mailing, advertising in local papers and on radio stations, possibly even billboards.","We'll evaluate our work through new memberships attained, growing our community of supporters, and by being closer to our goal of opening a food co-op. Additionally, we will track awareness of our project in the community through actions outlined in our business plan: surveys conducted at community workshops, follow-ups to our feasibility study(surveys), implementing a successful crowdfunding campaign, and engaging Cooperative Development Services.
 There will be evidence of our growth through hiring a qualified Bookkeeper and Project Manager to implement our growth strategy. With this personnel in place we will grow and achieve our goals sooner","There are two other healthy food stores forming in South LA .Neither one is a cooperative, one or both are b-corps. Neither has opened doors yet. They are situated in the Vermont corridor well east of Leimert Park in the Crenshaw corridor where SoLA plans to be. One is With Love Community Market and Café ( 18th St and Vermont), the other is Community Services Unlimited (66th and Vermont).
 
 SoLA's profits will belong to the members, that's the big difference.The profits of the co-op are shared and therefore reenter the community through our members.
 
  We also plan to be a store with classroom space, a deli, in store eating space, a bulk buying section as well as organic produce. SoLA is a unique opportunity for South LA to take charge of it's food sources and it's health and to reap the financial benefits of doing so.","Since it's inception, SoLA has sought advice from cooperative development organizations. We will continue to refer to these our ""elders"" as we grow. They are: California Center for Cooperative Development, and Food Co-op Initiative. There is no cost to SoLA for the expertise and advice of these organizations. Our work with the consulting group specifically geared toward helping build new co-ops,CDS Consulting Co-op, will cost $7,000 for the initial assessment workshop with SoLA's board of directors, in which a strategic plan is created, and an additional $7,000 for their continued consult in a maintenance program for one year.
 SoLA plans to create corporate sponsored memberships for needy families, partnering with organizations like Groceryships, to invite graduates of their program to receive sponsorships to become members of the co-op.","Our completed store will cost approximately 1.5 million dollars.

 In working closely with youth through arts, we receive many inquiries about careers in sound and lighting for events. This is where the SoundWorks L.A. will step in. 
 
 SoundWorks L.A. is geared to provide thorough training, workforce development and job placement for young people who traditionally have not had access to opportunity. Our goal is to provide pathways to jobs, increase the graduation rate among youth and encourage higher learning. In doing so, we will play a role in: 1) minimizing unemployment among young people; 2) encouraging youth to stay in high school and pursue higher education; 3) providing mentors and guidance to support student success; and 4) create a social enterprise model in an effort to bolster the local economy and access to viable and sustainable jobs and careers. Students will work on the latest equipment, gain a full overview of the industry, participate in workshops with industry professionals and build their personal career plan, taking ownership in their future. Upon completion of their coursework, students will receive a certificate. In aligning with the curricular objectives of college level institutions, our students will be ready to pursue higher learning and an increased variety of professional options. Along the way, students will participate in hands-on experiential learning.

Youth coming from disenfranchised communities and backgrounds have often received the message that they are ‘not good enough.’ This message may be compounded if there has been a debilitating experience. A key component of our programming will be to address ‘Internal & External Equity.’ It is critical that we provide our students with the tools to enhance their emotional intelligence and preparedness in order to navigate through a variety of diverse professional and social settings. We will provide resources through which they will be able to aim towards confidence and success.
 
 We are anticipating another barrier in employing graduates. We are tackling this obstacle by creating relationships with venues, industry and union leaders. We have initiated conversations with stakeholders to create a policy that will support the employment of youth, especially in communities demonstrating the most need.","In order to evaluate our work, we will first conduct an intake survey of our students. We will create SMART goals to support this effort (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely). While we are in process, we will create indicator markers for our students in being able to take on assigned tasks, create checklists and be able to articulate their knowledge. 
 
 We will evaluate our work on a community level by providing services for local festivals and events and conducting debriefs to identify what worked, what didn’t work and any room for improvement. We will also engage community leaders, stakeholders and clients to help us identify our success and any gaps. 
 
 We will look at agencies conducting similar work as well as businesses that offer similar services. We will also look for methods in which we could increase efficiency both in our programming and business model. We will conduct many of these evaluations every 6-12 months.","Locally, Hollywood CPR is a highly respected organization that has a similar purpose but slightly different focus.

Children’s Bureau’s South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program will work with corner stores to provide access to fresh, healthy food and increase the availability of nutritious options in low-income communities. Generally, a corner store has less than 2,000 square feet, 4 aisles or less, and 1 cash register. Children’s Bureau (CB) will recruit 14 corner stores, 1 in each of the following neighborhoods in District 1 in Los Angeles City: Glassell Park, Cypress Park, Highland Park, Mount Washington, Solano Canyon, Elysian Park, Echo Park, Westlake, Angelino Heights, Lafayette Park, Chinatown, Lincoln Heights, Montecito Heights, and Pico Union. 
 Once a corner store formally agrees to participate, they select 3 items from a healthy menu to introduce in their store. This menu includes bananas, avocadoes, mangoes, oranges, and apples. CB connects the stores with COMPRA Foods to purchase these items. COMPRA (Community Market Purchasing Real and Affordable) Foods is a food distribution company that delivers produce to small businesses. 
 CB then works with each corner store owner to provide one-on-one trainings about the skills necessary to make healthy changes profitable. CB also provides essential marketing tools, including nutrition labels and food demonstrations to guide customers to make healthy purchasing decisions. 
 All corner stores that implement 3 healthy foods and marketing strategies within 3 months of joining the program receive an incentive to purchase more healthy food. Corner stores that maintain their healthy food and marketing for 6 months are eligible for either a shelving unit or refrigerator to increase their capacity to provide healthy food.
 South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversions aims to help reverse the obesity epidemic by providing corner stores the resources to stock fresh, healthy food in low-income communities.","Children’s Bureau (CB) has previous experience working with local businesses to join a voluntary health improvement program. This program worked with local restaurants to increase their availability of healthy options. Although CB successfully on-boarded several restaurants, the most challenging aspect was enticing local restaurant owners to make healthy changes. From this experience, we anticipate that a challenge may be identifying corner store owners who are willing to make healthy conversions. Two important tactics we plan to incorporate to overcome this obstacle are to build one-on-one, supportive relationships with the owners and to highlight the potential business benefits of including healthy items. CB is confident that through the lessons learned recruiting restaurant owners to make healthy changes, we will be able to successfully recruit 14 corner store owners who are interested in serving as health champions in their community.","Children’s Bureau (CB) will evaluate our project by initially outreaching to 30 corner stores and then determining if we successfully recruited 14 out of the 30 corner stores. Second, CB will assess if these 14 corner stores underwent a corner store conversion. CB will also collect process data, which will allow corner store owners to determine if their new, healthy products are selling. These evaluations will help determine any potential barriers to stocking healthy food at the corner store. Additionally, CB will collect food demonstration pre- and post-tests. These evaluation tools will determine if the food demonstrations are effective in teaching customers how to use a corner store’s new, healthy ingredients to prepare a meal their whole family will enjoy. In CB's previous experience with conducting food demonstrations, surveys comparing data before and after each food demonstration show an overall increase in knowledge.","The Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is a healthy food retail project of the LA Food Policy Council that increases the capacity of corner stores to stock healthy items. Children’s Bureau’s South Los Angeles Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is unique in that we provide corner store owners with one-on-one, in-store trainings on how to price and display their healthy products. Additionally, Children’s Bureau conducts culturally appropriate food demonstrations in each of the participating corner stores. This will supply the corner stores with an additional resource to highlight the healthy food to their customers and will provide the customers with an opportunity to see how they can utilize the store’s new items to prepare a healthy meal that their family will enjoy. Both the individualized trainings about marketing and branding and the food demonstrations are intended to increase customers’ awareness and consumption of the new, healthy products and thereby aid in the efforts to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity.","Children’s Bureau (CB) plans to work with COMPRA (Community Market Purchasing Real and Affordable) Foods. COMPRA Foods is a food distribution company that delivers healthy foods to small businesses on a weekly basis that want to start offering fresh, healthy foods. CB will connect the corner stores with COMPRA Foods, as an avenue for the corner stores to purchase healthy foods. COMPRA Foods charges a one-time membership fee to join and $1,400 of the $100,000 grant will be used to cover this cost.","The outlined South LA Healthy Corner Store Conversion Program is estimated to cost $100,000. Children’s Bureau does not anticipate needing additional money to fund the program.","A. Full time Program Coordinator working 30% of their time on the program: $15,530.
 
 B. Benefits for full time Program Coordinator, including health, dental, vision, life and disability, state unemployment, workers compensation, and 401k: $4,193.
 The total benefits rate is calculated at 27% for full time employees. 
 
 C. Contract Worker with a Masters in Public Policy working 100% of their time on the program: $62,400.
 
 D. Promotional materials, such as signs and nutrition labels, for each corner store: $5,000.
 
 E. Program and office supplies to complete food demonstrations and daily work assignments: $4,500.
 
 F. Client related incentives for corner stores to purchase and display healthy foods, including membership fee to join COMPRA Foods and conversion equipment, such as a shelving unit or refrigerator: $6,500.","Children’s Bureau (CB) plans to expand our reach after successfully implementing the program in the 14neighborhoods within Los Angeles City of District 1. We hope to target additional corner stores in low-income communities throughout Los Angeles that have limited access to fresh, healthy foods and that have the highest rates of obesity and obesity-related diseases. CB aims to implement lessons learned, through evaluation and knowledge sharing among corner store and partners, and secure additional funding for successful scaling."
5102278,Spark LA Youth Apprenticeships,2016200,,,"What if everyday professionals could help improve LA’s dropout rate, right from their desks? By pairing students with mentors in exciting workplaces like Google and Hulu, Spark connects the dots between school and a future career. 
 
 69% of LA students drop out in 9th grade, but if mentors can ignite a spark in them—in 7th and 8th grade—students would be motivated to stay in school. With less than 1% of the LA workforce serving as a mentor, Spark could reach every off-track 7th and 8th grader.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Spark is partnered with 6 LAUSD schools, as well as workplaces throughout the city.",ALL,"If LA is going to be the best place to learn, learning cannot be isolated to schools, and the task of educating our youth cannot be given only to teachers. Spark engages working professionals throughout the city to mentor middle school students at-risk of dropping out, to be the next generation of architects, computer programmers, scientists, and more.
 
 Spark LA takes traditional classroom education and expands it, connecting it with real-life workplaces. In the spring of 2010, Spark LA launched with 13 students and a big vision: to meaningfully impact LA’s education landscape. By 2050, Spark envisions every off-track LA student being matched with a mentor who inspires them to stay in school and graduate, effectively making LA the best place to learn.
 
 In the current academic year, Spark LA is serving 350 LA students across 6 schools in underserved neighborhoods, such as Boyle Heights, East Hollywood, MacArthur Park, and South LA. We are also engaging over 600 mentors from over 20 of LA’s top companies, including Hulu, Cornerstone OnDemand, HBO, Union Bank, Wells Fargo Capital, Gensler, Pandora, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
 
 Not only do students and schools benefit, but LA’s top companies and their employees are directly engaged and supporting local education efforts. Spark provides companies with a turnkey employee engagement program. Mentors using Spark to build relationships across departments at their company, in addition to networking with mentors from other companies. 98% of mentors report that they are ‘proud’ their company partners with Spark, thus increasing employee brand loyalty and engagement.
 
 What’s more, the Spark Program works! Our results to date have shown that 89% of Spark students finish 8th grade on track for on time high school graduation, compared to 70% of their peers. Furthermore, 92% of Spark alumni have graduated high school on time, or are on track to do so, far surpassing local and national graduation rates of 70% and 80%, respectively.
  
 Spark LA is building a movement, with the goal of serving entire schools and neighborhoods by 2050. As more students see the relevance of their education through Spark, local graduation rates will improve, and youth will have the skills and career exposure that will help them succeed in their academic, professional, and personal lives. Imagine all at-risk LA students being matched with a mentor; what a great city in which to learn!","When Spark served less than 100 students, we were able to recruit mentors through cold-calls and word of mouth. As we have nearly quadrupled the number of students served—and seek to grow further—one challenge is recruiting enough mentors to support 2 apprenticeships per student. This year alone, Spark anticipates needing to recruit at least 600 mentors to serve 350 students. By 2050, we will need to recruit exponentially higher numbers of mentors to achieve our vision of matching every off-track student with a mentor. Unless we are able to effectively grow our mentor base, we will be unable to scale.
 
 To overcome this challenge, we are building partnerships with companies that can provide high numbers of mentors, like companies such as Cornerstone OnDemand, with over 60 mentors, or Hulu, with over 30 mentors. We are also revamping our corporate outreach materials and raising brand awareness through events and public relations efforts.","By 2050, Spark wants to match every struggling LA middle schooler with a mentor from a local workplace. To achieve this, we need to build long-term partnerships with more schools, as well as with the biggest companies in LA. We need to deepen our engagement with each of our current corporate partners by involving more employees each semester. Additionally, we need to launch new partnerships with companies that are excited about getting their employees involved. 
 
 By 2050, Spark wants every LA student to finish 8th grade on track for graduation. To do so, we help struggling 7th and 8th graders to improve their social/emotional and workforce skills, and school performance. To evaluate our progress, we have a data-sharing agreement with LAUSD through which we track students’ grades and attendance records. We also have students, parents, teachers, and mentors complete pre-, mid-, and post-program surveys geared towards tracking changes in students’ social/emotional and workforce skills.","There are many mentoring and education-focused nonprofits in LA and across the country. Many people confuse Spark’s program with internships or job shadowing programs; others compare it to one-day programs where employees talk about their careers to students. However, the learning that takes place between students and their mentors is much deeper than that.
 
 What makes Spark unique? Spark students are placed in one-on-one ‘apprenticeships’ with a working professional at the workplace. Together, they work on a hands-on project, like building an app or creating a business plan. This unique project-based component helps students draw connections between the workplace and the classroom, and keeps them engaged in their learning. Research shows that such hands-on learning improves students’ attitudes about learning, retention of content, and problem-solving and collaboration skills (Farrington, et al, 2012). Rather than many one-day career day programs, students meet with their mentor for 10 weeks each semester.
 
 Additionally, Spark has a sharp focus on middle school – the formative years that can determine whether or not a student graduates from high school. While many organizations focus on early childhood education and college prep, few target the middle school years; yet, research has shown that as many as 60% of students become “chronically disengaged” in these adolescent years (Klem and Connell, 2004).
 
 In addition to impacting individual students, Spark has created a simple way for companies and organizations to get involved in supporting education in the city by removing all the obstacles to volunteerism. Not only does Spark bring the students to the companies, we also train mentors and provide the ongoing support they need to be successful. Spark makes it easy for working professionals to give back to LA’s students, right from their desk, during the workday. Spark is creating a movement, with 600 volunteer mentors per year!","Through a partnership with LAUSD, Spark partners with schools that serve predominantly low-income, minority students. Spark is currently partnered with 6 LAUSD schools:
 - Bethune Middle School (South LA)
 - Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, Burlington (MacArthur Park)
 - Clinton Middle School (South LA)
 - Stevenson Middle School (Boyle Heights)
 - Le Conte Middle School (East Hollywood)
 - Nava Learning Academy (South LA)
 
 Through the partnership with LAUSD, Spark is also able to track students through high school, a key piece of understanding the long-term impact of our program
 
 Schools agree to pay a fee to bring Spark to their students; however, the school fees represent less than 15% of the actual cost to bring Spark to each school. As such, if awarded, Spark will allocate 100% of the grant towards serving these 6 schools.
 
 Spark’s partnership with LeConte Middle School is supported by funds from President Obama’s Promise Neighborhood’s initiative. The grant’s primary recipient, Youth Policy Institute, selected Spark LA as one of five partners with which to partner in order to provide positive programming for youth in the area. 
 
 While schools provide one side of the student-mentor equation, Spark LA’s workplace partners offer the other side: a reliable source of volunteer mentors. Spark’s corporate partners include LA’s top companies in a wide range of fields, including entertainment, technology, finance, architecture and engineering, and more. This year, Spark will partner with over 20 corporate partners. Spark’s corporate partners – Cornerstone OnDemand, Hulu, Warner Bros., HBO, Sony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Union Bank, and others – provide transportation, monetary and in-kind donations, and over 14,000 volunteer hours throughout the program year.
 
 Finally, we are also partnered with Public Allies, which provides frontline program staff, allowing Spark to broaden its partnerships with other nonprofits while also minimizing program costs.","To bring this impactful program to 350 students, Spark LA estimates it will cost $923,113. To cover the additional cost of $823,113, we will draw on our diverse and robust funding base, including foundation, corporate, government, and individual funders. Spark LA’s highly engaged executive and advisory boards also provide substantial fundraising support and were responsible for 40% of revenue in the last fiscal year.
 
 In October 2015, we will host Spark A Dream, our annual fundraiser, for which we have set a fundraising goal of $400,000. Last year, the event raised more than $400,000 to support Spark’s work, and generated local philanthropic support and new corporate partnerships. This year, the event will be hosted by Judy Reyes, best known for her portrayal of Carla on the hit television show Scrubs. With this increased local attention and celebrity host, we are confident in our ability to again reach our fundraising goal.
 
 In addition to our annual fundraiser, we have developed a robust pipeline of foundation and corporate supporters to cover our additional expenses. This pipeline includes over $700,000 in foundation grants and corporate donations. Many corporate partners agree to pay the costs associated with the students placed at their companies, contributing to Spark’s diverse funding base. Finally, Spark has secured $95,000 in funding from school partners and government funding.","Program Personnel Expenses: $67,500
 Spark relies on 3 experienced frontline program staff members to ensure an effective program. Spark has invested in strategies to lower personnel expenses, while maintaining a high quality program, such as moving labor intensive program components onto an online platform. As a result, this year, Spark will increase the number of students served by 34%, while decreasing the number of frontline program staff.
 
 ‘Discovery Night’ Expenses (Spark’s year-end project showcase): $10,000
 In May 2016, Spark will bring together students and mentors to share their hands-on projects with peers, family members, teachers, and the larger community. Spark’s Discovery Night are an exciting citywide event, and have even been featured in the LA Times (Dec 2014).
 
 Our additional expenses are:
 Travel and Meeting Expenses: $7,500
 Program Supplies: $5,000
 Volunteer Mentor Background Check Expenses: $5,000
 Marketing and Outreach Expenses: $5,000","Currently, we estimate that there are over 46,000 7th and 8th grade LAUSD students who will enter high school underprepared or at-risk of dropping out. Spark LA is preparing to scale its programming, with the vision of serving every off-track LA middle school student by 2050. Spark is working to bring about this vision by:
 
  – Deepening and Expanding Spark’s presence within local corporations
 As previously mentioned, Spark is seeking to engage more mentors at each company, and build new partnerships. Spark is working to become an integral part of each company’s culture so that we have ample mentors for our students. We have found that the key to building partnerships with corporations is gaining support from the executives who can use their platform to encourage employees to participate. Our partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand is an example of how we have built connections at the executive level. Co-Founder and Chief Financial Officer, Perry Wallack, first got involved with Spark in 2012 when he was one of the three employees who volunteered to mentor. Thanks to Wallack’s ongoing support, the partnership has grown tremendously in only three years; Spark is engaging 64 Cornerstone OnDemand employees as mentors this semester alone. Additionally, Cornerstone OnDemand provides significant financial support, including paying for transportation for students completing apprenticeships at their company and providing free use of their software for our online platform. Spark is working to build more partnerships that follow this model in order to scale the program throughout the city.
 
 – Launching a technology platform, Spark Online
 Through a partnership with LA corporate partner Cornerstone OnDemand, Spark is launching an online platform, Spark Online. This online platform puts key resources directly into the mentor’s hands, like activity resources, a project library, and training videos. It also provides a place for teachers to collaborate on each student’s Spark experience. In future years, the online platform will provide an avenue for Spark to share its program with other organizations, allowing the Spark model to scale."

All too often, these pets become victims. Relishing in their power, abusers beat, torture and kill beloved animals for the sake of hurting, silencing or preventing their partners from leaving. 
 Leaving can be difficult. Boarding services are expensive and most domestic violence shelters cannot house animals. Many victims face a gut wrenching decision. Do they run for a shelter and leave their beloved pet behind? Or, do they stay and risk their lives to protect their pet? According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, “between 25 and 40 percent of domestic violence victims will not leave a dangerous situation because they do not want to abandon their pets.”
 This is where we help. Animal Safety Net (ASN)™ assists domestic violence survivors by offering free temporary housing for their pets, taking them out of harm’s way, and allowing survivors to relocate to a domestic violence shelter. While under our care, animals receive veterinary treatment, vaccinations and spay/neuter surgery. Families remain in contact with their pets through photos and updates until they are safely out of the shelter and reunited. 
 Domestic violence, child abuse, and animal abuse are all linked. Studies have found that domestic violence abusers who harm animals are twice as likely have also abused a child. These children suffer both physical and mental abuse – as the exposure to their beloved pet being hurt can have deeply adverse psychological effects. ASN helps stop this cycle of violence. This program empowers survivors to leave and seek care. Further, if animal abuse is suspected, spcaLA Humane Officers will investigate and work to prosecute the offenders. 
 At its core, ASN gives domestic violence survivors peace of mind. The comfort in knowing their adored pet is protected and cared for helps survivors escape, persevere, and begin building a safer, healthier life for themselves and their family.","Our greatest challenge is limited funding. Unlike shelter pets, ASN animals do not quickly cycle out of our care. These animals are often housed for extended periods of time and frequently require routine medication, special diet, and help with behavioral issues.
 These animals can also be challenging to place in foster homes. ASN clients often have two or more pets at home. Placing two animals – especially two large dogs – even without the medical and behavioral considerations often present with ASN pets, can be problematic. 
 To house and care for these often “difficult” animals, we require a designated program facility, foster compensation, and above all, consistent funding. As a nonprofit organization, we rely on public support to facilitate all of our programs, including ASN. Therefore, to combat limited funding and provide for these animals, we will continuously seek public donations and grant support.","spcaLA wants to expand ASN to help more domestic violence survivors and their pets. We will evaluate our program by reviewing its development. More specifically, we will assess:
 - ASN foster parent database
 - program staff
 - facility space 
 - partnerships and collaboration with domestic violence shelters and humane organizations
 - # of animal abusers prosecuted
 - # of animals and survivors we support
 Successful implementation of this grant will ultimately demonstrate that more families were helped because of our program’s expansion.","spcaLA’s ASN program was the first of its kind in the country. We have taken clients from as far away as Florida for lack of local resources. And, while a handful of humane organizations offer similar programming and some DV shelters added limited onsite kenneling, it is not enough. 
 The sad reality is, many animals in a domestic violence situation have been harmed. Either abused, or made to live in a state of fear, they typically need more than a bed. They need veterinary care and behavior enrichment. They need to learn how to trust people again. They need the resources and expertise that can be provided by a humane agency, like spcaLA.
 spcaLA’s approach is unique in a number of ways, on the small, day-to-day scale, spcaLA offers:
 - Transportation to and from spcaLA facilities for ASN pets
 - Safe shelter including food, toys, treats and fresh bedding 
 - Veterinary care, including spay/neuter, vaccinations, and routine care, as well as care for more in-depth issues
 - Behavior enrichment and a plan of care developed by spcaLA Animal Behavior & Training Department
 - Facilities for multiple pets and those with special medical or behavioral needs
 - spcaLA is the only nonprofit animal welfare agency in the city of Los Angeles that is also Law Enforcement. If abusers turned their wrath toward the pets in our care, spcaLA Humane Officers will investigate and gather forensic evidence, so that animal cruelty charges can be brought against the offender.
 To better accommodate the ever-growing demand for ASN services, spcaLA desires to increase these offerings by:
 - Recruiting and compensating foster parents specific to ASN (currently, spcaLA foster parents do not receive any financial compensation)
 - Hiring additional staff to manage the program
 - Repurposing existing facilities to house ASN animals and/or paying for boarding facilities
 On a larger scale, spcaLA seeks to make ASN replicable. Like our award-winning violence-prevention program, Teaching Love & Compassion, spcaLA has developed a comprehensive manual for the ASN program. The manual offers humane agencies step-by-step instructions and guidance to operate the program in their communities. As part of the LA2050 Challenge, spcaLA seeks to market the ASN manual to other humane agencies in Southern California, thereby developing a true network of support for domestic violence survivors and their pets.","Successfully expanding ASN involves the collaboration between domestic violence shelters, police officials, and social service agencies. To help survivors, they must know we’re here. These organizations help share our services to those who can use our support. 
 While our program involves teamwork, ASN will be managed and staffed solely by spcaLA. The entirety of the grant will go to the ASN program.","$100,000 will play a substantial role in expanding the ASN program – a service the LA community deeply needs. But, to continue the program annually, ASN will require continuous funding. To cover these costs, spcaLA will continue to fundraise and allot a program budget.","LA2050 funding will be used to do the following.
 - Hire an ASN coordinator, who will be responsible for foster parent support, recruitment, & retention, as well as managing the boarding facility, evaluating the program and working within the community to increase awareness of our services.
 - Repurpose an existing spcaLA facility to accommodate ASN pets during peak seasons (typically Oct-Feb) and/or pay for boarding of pets. Costs may include:
 o staffing (two full-time animal care attendants)
 o operating costs for the facility
 o transportation (veterinarians, clients, clients)
 o minor renovations/repairs
 o boarding costs
 - Produce and market ASN materials to other humane agencies
 - Provide veterinary care, food, and shelter to animals in the program
 We anticipate grant funds will be used as follows:
 • $10,000: Veterinary Services & Food
 • $2,500: Transportation
 • $70,000: Staff Salary
 • $1,500: Foster Compensation
 • $1,000: Marketing 
 • $15,000: Facility/Misc.","The success of our proposal will ultimately be measured by the number of animals and survivors we support, as well as whether or not we are successful in replicating the program. Regardless of how many foster parents we’ve acquired, staff hired, or facilities we’ve repurposed, what is fundamentally important, is the number of lives we’ve improved. The number of men, women, and children we help escape the reign of their abuser and seek refuge. The number of survivors we give hope and peace of mind knowing their cherished pet is in good hands. The number of families we reunite and keep intact. This is how we measure success. 
 
 Last year, we helped 62 men, women, and children in 30 families by caring for their pets. A total of 32 dogs, 5 cats, 1 rabbit and 1 hamster were housed in safe, loving homes while their human families received much needed emotional support from domestic violence shelters across Los Angeles County. This year, we want to help more. 
 If expanding the ASN program helps save the lives of more people and pets and catches like wildfire – spreading to other humane organizations and communities - our project will be deemed successful."
5102035,STARS (Super Talented Artists Resource Studio) Fosters Artistic Entrepreneurship in L.A.,2015021,,,"Our 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Breaking into Hollywood, will launch an innovative resource center: STARS (Super Talented Artists' Resource Studio) in the city of Los Angeles for creative and business professionals in the entertainment industry. STARS will be a brick and mortar hub for aspiring and mid-level artists to collaborate and showcase their diverse talents.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Learn,"Our organization will make LA a better place utilizing STARS to foster artistic entrepreneurship along with cultural and economic diversity. Currently, Los Angeles is the mecca for creativity within the entertainment industry. However, it is difficult for aspiring and mid-level professionals to effectively pursue their entertainment careers when they lack key resources. According to UCLA’s 2014 Hollywood Diversity report, women, minorities and low-income creative professionals are underrepresented in the entertainment field. Our STARS’ facility will help our LA entertainment capital diversify its working population to be more reflective of the mirage of artists pursuing their careers. 
 
 STARS will provide the creative community with access to state-of-the art shared equipment, education and training, and accountability partnerships. As a result of STARS, more diverse artists will be better equipped for industry jobs and to produce their own projects, which will ultimately stabilize their finances as an artisticpreneur.
 
 STARS will not only be a destination for creatives, but the heart of where careers are developed and artistic dreams come true for all. Currently, our organization hosts over 25 educational networking events at various locations throughout the year with a total attendance of 2,000 entertainment professionals. This grant will allow our organization to use one venue for our events and programming. Los Angeles will become a better place to create because artists will not only have an avenue to learn about the creative arts, but also an artistic location to create their projects and showcase their talent within our center’s facility.
 
 Every professional coming through the door of the resource center will have an opportunity to become involved with our various Sections. STARS’ Sections are divided into each profession, such as the Acting Section, Writing Section, Directing Section, Producing Section, Music Composing Section, etc. Section Members can work individually within their Section, or collaborate with other Sections. Each Section has a Chair that is responsible to make sure that each Section showcases at least one project, or a joint project with another Section.","One barrier/challenge will be making the public aware of the resource center, particularly for recent college graduates and diverse groups. Our strategy is to utilize our 5,000 email list of industry professionals and local media to announce the opening of the center. Additional strategy for publicizing the center will include partnering with established industry organizations that focus on specific minority groups and women. We will also research diverse social media groups to get the word out that STARS exists. While there is often a key focus of finding talent from prestigious LA universities such as UCLA and USC. We will also notify community colleges in the county of Los Angeles, which will help us to get the word out to diverse aspiring professionals from an ethnic and economic standpoint.","We will evaluate our work through surveys and keep track of the number of people as well as the demographics of the people utilizing STARS. Each person taking advantage of the studio will be required to complete an initial survey and an ‘exit’ survey upon completion of a personal career project or Section team project. 
 
 We will monitor the number of projects being created within our center on a regular basis. Through our quarterly evaluation methods, we will be able to make any necessary adjustments to maximize the center’s operational goals.","The major industry organizations such as SAG, DGA, WGA, PGA, and other associations host events and offer resources to their members. But majority of their members are not aspiring and mid-level, they are primarily working professionals. Those unions also have pricey membership fees which is typically not affordable to aspiring and mid-level talent, which is the key focus of our center. 
 
 We will shepherd extremely talented professionals who may not have the credits to be a part of the unions. We will also provide them with training and industry contacts to better equip them with the tools needed to thrive in the entertainment business. 
 
 Majority of networking and educational events hosted by industry unions and other centers often occur in the evenings to accommodate those professionals who already have jobs. However, evening events often prevent many talented artists from attending because they do not have their own cars or because they work night shifts to obtain higher pay. Many industry events are held at elite locations which is not feasible for direct and safe bus routes. It can take artists 2-4 hours to arrive on time at an event that is only 20-45 mins way in a car. Lengthy public transportation commutes is a frequent hindrance for low-income industry professionals who have a sincere desire to attend evening workshops. STARS is unique in that it will hold a variety of events in the day to accommodate those who take public transportation.
 
 The STARS mission will be to equip and empower entertainment professionals with the tools needed to create their projects in a collaborative artistic environment. Collaboration is a key aspect of being successful in Hollywood. STARS will embrace collaboration and diversity among the various industry crafts.
 
 Lastly, STARS is unique because it is similar to a resource center but it operates like a small studio. It is a place where creative projects are actually being produced similar to a lab environment in the tech space. All artists will retain ownership of any projects they create unless otherwise decided by the artists. In other words, the studio will not own intellectual properties just because they are being created with the use of our STARS facility. To empower artists’ entrepreneurial spirits, STARS’ users will be encouraged to start their own entertainment companies utilizing guidance from our studio.

5102224,Strengthening LAs Entrepreneurs through Responsible Microlending,2018093,,,"Opportunity Fund has a vision that every entrepreneur in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize his or her full potential to create wealth and jobs. As California’s largest nonprofit microlender, we seek to invest $10 million in 700 small businesses across LA this year—creating and retaining 1,800 jobs and driving economic activity in the region’s most underserved communities.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0Create0Live,"Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for the future. The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors; this lack of opportunity is compounded for low-income and minority households by the poor education system. For many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability. 
 
 Small business ownership creates opportunities for families living in poverty to pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their communities. If one in three microenterprises hired an additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the economy. Yet, every day, 8,000 small businesses in the U.S. are turned down for a loan; 50% of small businesses fail, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs, and credit issues. 
 
 The mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown. The fast-growing alternative financing industry offers access to fast cash, but often at a high cost that can strangle a small business’ cash flow. Opportunity Fund is filling this financing gap by pioneering a new approach that combines technology, efficiency, market knowledge, and impact measurement to help entrepreneurs build sustainable enterprises and a better life for themselves and their families. By deploying affordable, responsible microloans to underserved entrepreneurs, our microlending program helps drive small business growth and job creation in the communities that need it most. 
 
 We target entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream. In LA, our borrowers are 98% minority, with an average median household income of less than $25,000. These clients have a 90% business survival rate; each loan we originate creates or sustains 2.5 jobs on average. 
 
 Through the LA2050 Challenge, we seek to scale our microlending in LA’s underserved communities to serve 700 small business owners in 2016—creating and retaining 1,800 jobs and generating more than $25 million in annual economic activity through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.","The credit crunch, combined with advances in financial technology and “Big Data,” has created an alternative financing industry that offers entrepreneurs access to fast cash but often at a very high cost. Merchant cash advances, in particular, offer quick money, but ensure repayment by taking a fixed portion of up to 50% of every credit/debit card sale—with annualized interest rates reaching 170%. 
 
 Opportunity Fund is finding an increasing number of small business owners who come to us with multiple “stacked” cash advances that are squeezing daily cash flow to such an extent that the business may not survive. Unfortunately, many of these stacked businesses have such constricted cash flow that they cannot qualify for an Opportunity Fund loan. To address this challenge, we seek to prevent entrepreneurs from taking on a cash advance in the first place by getting to them before the merchant cash advance providers do—through outreach, partnerships, and borrower education.","Opportunity Fund uses a variety of performance indicators to measure the success of our small business clients. In the short term, we track the number of applicants and number, dollar volume, and type of loans originated, as well as client characteristics such as income, ethnicity, gender, credit score, household size, type of business, sales, and number of employees. 
 
 Over time, we measure the impact of our loans by tracking changes in borrower household income; growth of business sales and income; job creation; and business survival rates. We also gather data related to client satisfaction and confidence in running their business. 
 
 We recently launched a multi-year effort to evaluate the longer-term impact of microloans on businesses, households, and the community at large. This study will gather and analyze data from thousands of microlending clients to deepen our understanding of the impact of a microloan on key economic and household measures.","LA is home to a number of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that offer a range of economic development services, including access to capital. Local microlenders exist on a continuum that runs from the smallest microloans (offered by Grameen America for household and business purposes) to the financial mainstream, represented by local banks. Among the region’s CDFIs, Opportunity Fund is one of the only microlenders focused on scale with the ability to originate 700 loans in LA (and 2,000 state-wide) in a year. Our loans range from $2,500 to $100,000, with an average loan size of $18,000. Some of our peer CDFIs focus on business development services, and originate loans on a smaller scale as part of these programs. Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) operates at a comparable size to Opportunity Fund in LA but focuses on larger loans of $100,000 to $700,000 to much larger enterprises. 
 
 By providing microloans to smaller businesses, Opportunity Fund is able to ensure the full range of entrepreneurs in LA has access to affordable financing. In addition, we offer our unique EasyPay loan--an innovative automated loan repayment system that allows borrowers to repay loans through a small, fixed percentage of daily credit/debit card sales. 
 
 As noted above, Opportunity Fund also competes against high-cost alternative financing products. For small business owners who cannot qualify for a traditional bank loan, there are few good alternatives. Credit cards provide access to financing to invest in a growing business, but can leave entrepreneurs with high balances and poor credit scores. Payday lenders offer fast cash, but at a perilously high interest rate. Opportunity Fund’s most significant competition is from merchant cash advances (MCAs) and other unregulated small business financing products. The merchant cash advance industry consists of non-bank companies whose products are unregulated, and who do not report to credit bureaus. Despite charging exorbitant rates, MCA providers hold $1 to $2 billion in outstanding financing to small businesses. Through EasyPay, Opportunity Fund is the only nonprofit lender in the country that is able to provide an affordable alternative to merchant cash advances that incorporates their convenience and flexibility, but with far greater benefit to small business owners.","Opportunity Fund works with a range of partners to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs.
 • Banks: We have built a network of bank representatives to facilitate referrals of clients who have been declined for a loan. 
 • Vendors: We leverage relationships with business services providers to raise awareness and generate referrals, including commercial vehicle dealers, tax advisors, CPAs, and equipment vendors (manufacturers of food trucks, dry cleaning equipment, etc.). 
 • Community partners: We have referral relationships with organizations that serve local low-income and disadvantaged communities, such as Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation and City of LA Business Source Offices.
 
 Funds from the LA2050 Challenge would support Opportunity Fund staff in building and nurturing these critical partnerships, but funding would not go directly to partners.","It will cost approximately $2.5 million to deploy $10 million into LA's underserved small business community. A $100,000 grant through LA2050 will provide critical funding to support the outreach, underwriting, advising, and loan servicing activities needed to help LA’s entrepreneurs grow their business and create and retain jobs in their communities. Earned income from loan interest and fees will provide an additional $1,500,000 towards this project, and Opportunity Fund plans to secure the remaining $900,000 from local institutional and individual funders (including the Parsons Foundation, Weingart Foundation, California Community Foundation, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and others). 
 
 Overall, Opportunity Fund is a financially sound organization with strong cash reserves. Given our strong track record of social impact—and the growing recognition of the importance of access to capital in helping underserved small business owners create jobs and spur economic growth—we remain confident of our ability to secure the funds we need to scale microlending, expand our impact in LA, and fulfill our mission. To meet the funding challenges ahead, we will rely on our growing base of supporters, board members who help expand our network, and our reputation as a microfinance leader and innovator.","Opportunity Fund will use a portion of LA2050 grant funds ($75,000) to cover the “people” costs of deploying capital to underserved entrepreneurs. Specifically, these funds will help pay salaries for Opportunity Fund’s microlending team to conduct the marketing, outreach, underwriting, advising, and loan servicing activities necessary to provide LA’s small business owners with access to financing and business support. We will use additional LA2050 grant funds ($25,000) to invest in marketing strategies to reach our target population of low-income entrepreneurs. Our marketing plan will include a multi-channel campaign integrating direct mail and mobile marketing with web-based strategies to educate small businesses about the true costs of merchant cash advances and offer Opportunity Fund as a better alternative.","Opportunity Fund has a vision that every small business in Los Angeles can access the financing and support needed to realize its full potential to create wealth and jobs. While we have no illusions that our microloans can eradicate income inequality, we believe that strong investment in the region’s small business community can drive economic growth and create jobs that offer a living wage. Many of LA’s most economically distressed neighborhoods are also hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity. By providing access to capital and support for these small businesses, Opportunity Fund can help them grow and thrive—offering a path to financial stability and economic mobility. 
 
 Over the past five years, we have gone from originating 70 loans a year in LA to 70loans a month in the county. We have achieved this growth by investing in the people and technology to reach and serve LA’s entrepreneurs. We know that every loan we make creates and sustains more than two jobs, and that every $1 we invest results in a ripple effect that generates almost $2 in new economic activity. By investing to scale in Los Angeles, Opportunity Fund is positioned to help thousands of small business owners access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050—supporting job creation at significant scale while spurring economic growth in communities that need it most."

Such access benefits the physiological and psychological well-being of our communities. Recognizing the benefits of community urban farms, our plan is to work within dense urban spaces to establish solar-powered, sustainable, community-based urban farms using a new water-wise conservation strategy in downtown Los Angeles without having to invest in real estate. We thus work with the urban environment as it presents itself to us. 
 
 The Tower Garden System is soil-less and uses 90% less water compared to soil based farming through its vertical aeroponic design. Plants thrive with purified pH controlled water and micro nutrients, providing a “beyond organic” farming technique. In partnership with LA Urban Farms, Union Church L.A., and Union Rescue Mission, GIVE plans to install twenty vertical tower planters on the South side of Union Church (see layout), located two blocks from Skid Row. 
 
 In an effort to help homeless individuals secure needed jobs and provide fulfilling and healthy physical activities for seniors living in Little Tokyo, GIVE will train local seniors and job-ready former Skidrow residents through Union Rescue Missions’ Job Development Program in the maintenance and care of the Tower Gardens. While the project is focused on outreaching to former Skidrow residents and seniors, the program and space will be open to all Little Tokyo residents to benefit community life and health of the whole neighborhood. 
 
 In the first year, the sustainable, organic food grown will be donated to Union Rescue Mission and other homeless shelters, as well as the students and their families who grew them. The long-term goal is to train and develop an urban farmers market network where urban farmers will be able to receive micro-loans to start their own businesses, and sell their produce at local farmers markets and to restaurants.","One of the major barriers we expect is a lack of awareness and interest in farming in urban spaces, as well as the appeal of eating plant based meals as a way of health and wellness. To counter this challenge while our site is being prepared for the garden towers, our GIVE team and volunteers will focus on outreach and education in the neighborhood by hosting a harvest festival, passing out flyers and talking to neighbors, and hosting workshops for our neighborhood on the benefits of a plant-based diet and a urban community farm. Further, our six-week long trainings will include education on nutrition, health, and wellness.",We will evaluate the success of our program based on how many urban farmers we graduate from our 6-week course and how many students are able to secure jobs after they graduate.,"Our partner, the LA Urban Farms (www.laurbanfarms.com) program is promoting urban farms in schools, restaurants, and homes.

We propose to develop and implement a sustainability curriculum for elementary school students that will personalize climate change, and help develop an aware generation with the skill set to make and advocate for environmentally friendly choices, and thereby help make Los Angeles a better place to live.
 
 Our proposal consists of a pilot sustainability curriculum to be delivered online so students can access it both in class and at home. The fun and engaging educational content and related activities will provide a broad overview of sustainability -- climate change and greenhouse gases, transportation alternatives, energy, water, waste, heat island effect, healthy food and sustainable living -- and emphasize how everyone and everything is connected and how personal actions can have global effects.
  
 As part of the curriculum, students and parents would be encouraged to implement related activities, such as exploring environmentally friendly transportation options (walking, biking, public transit), and reducing waste, energy and water use on campus and at home. Schools would be encouraged and supported through the pilot to connect students, their families, and other community members in collaborations to implement environmentally friendly projects such as planting trees on and around campus to reduce the heat island effect in their community, or install rain barrels and rain gardens. The Los Angeles World’s Fair will work to develop partnerships in furtherance of this goal.
 
 Successful implementation of the pilot, and subsequently scaling to schools in other communities, would improve the resiliency of these communities by helping reduce the impacts of climate change -- for example, climate change is expected to increase the number of extreme heat days by 50% -- increasing tree canopy coverage would create a virtuous cycle -- reducing the heat island effect and therefore the need for additional energy and water to run air conditioning, which in turn would reduce the generation of additional greenhouse gas emissions.
 
 Based on the success of the pilot, additional modules would be developed in the future to provide deeper dives into specific sustainability topics.","Adoption of the curriculum by schools may be a challenge. Our goal is to develop strategic partnerships with organizations that have existing relationships with schools/ districts that would be able to influence the adoption of this program on a pilot basis. Assistance from LA2050 would be greatly appreciated! The provision of the curriculum at no cost to the schools, and bringing grant funds to bear to support community outreach for projects, such as tree planting, are expected to be significant factors in overcoming these obstacles.","We will:
 - Survey pilot schools to determine their bike/walk/transit scores before and after delivery of the curriculum.
 - Track the number of trees planted through the program, and project tree canopy coverage at maturity.
 - Assess students’ knowledge about sustainability issues at the beginning and end of the curriculum.
 - Engage and track numbers of family and community members involved in curriculum supported activities.
 - Track the number of schools willing to participate in the initial and subsequent phases of the pilot.","LA DWP has a free-tree program, as does TreePeople -- their efforts are complementary, and we are exploring partnerships with both. The Metropolitan Water District and LA DWP have rebate programs for water and energy conservation measures that would help support implementation of potential activities (such as installation of rain barrels, and other water and energy saving devices).
 
 This proposed curriculum is unique in trying to help students understand the direct connection between their actions and the global environment, and providing tools and resources to do something about it.","The U.S. Green Building Council -- Los Angeles Chapter will work with us through: The Green Apple Day of Service program for implementation of projects at schools, and The Center for Green Schools, which can assist in development of the curriculum.
 
 We are also exploring partnerships with the Los Angeles Unified School District, TreePeople, and LA DWP.
 
 At the moment, all of the grant award would be utilized by the LAWF to support development of curriculum content and the delivery platform, as well as engage schools to participate in the pilot.
 
 We expect to engage additional partners -- local community businesses, nonprofits and local government agencies -- to support implementation of various activities, such as tree planting, installation of rain barrels, and others as identified by the specific schools.","We have sized development and implementation of the pilot to cost $100,000.

The success of the program has led us to plan an expansion of our capacity and partnership with LAUSD in 2016. By increasing capacity at our existing site and expanding to two new schools, we will reach 830 students annually with our rigorous water safety, swimming instruction and competitive program.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,Learn,"The Trojan Swim Club (TSC) Outreach Program was created as a direct response to the racial and socioeconomic barriers that contribute to the disparate rate of drowning amongst children of color - three times that of white children - and to this same group’s under-representation in recreational and competitive swimming. By empowering disadvantaged youth with the skills, confidence and desire to reach their fullest potential in life, these programs promise to be training grounds for success in and out of the water, and to change forever the lives of the youth they touch.
 
  In the 2014-15 school year, TSC served 200 youth of which 66% were female, 34% male, 85% Latino and 15% Black. A team of 50 was launched to introduce the most passionate participants to the components of competitive swimming with the goal of preparing them to advance to a competitive program and compete in meets sanctioned by USA Swimming. Twenty-five will join a competitive program scheduled to start at Fremont High School in January of 2016.
 
 Our curriculum is based on best practices in the field and is designed to help students acquire basic water safety skills, develop proper stroke techniques and also prepare advanced students for competitive swimming. The majority of the staff is made up of seasoned instructors with a passion for teaching disadvantaged youth to swim. 
 
 Our planned program expansion will allow us to implement high-quality swim programs at three schools in Los Angeles in 2016, providing 830 underserved youth with the instruction and mentorship necessary to develop basic water safety skills, learn how to swim, and for those that discover a love for swimming, to advance to TSC’s competitive swimming program with the potential to participate in college-level athletics.
 
 We envision a 2050 in which all Los Angeles youth have equitable access to recreational spaces and programs. Access to high-quality swim programs is a single piece of this puzzle, but, we believe, an important one in promoting positive youth development. Beyond the more easily measured health benefits, programs like ours have been shown to reduce neighborhood crime and improve the academic performance and general well-being of the youth that participate. We want to bring Los Angeles one step closer to a 2050 in which every child has the same opportunity to learn to swim and be healthy physically, socially and emotionally, irrespective of their parents’ paychecks or the color of their skin.","Transportation to programs sites and to competitions is likely to be a challenge after our expansion to two new sites. Participants in the age group program at John C. Fremont High School will likely be students at Bethune Middle School and 75th St. Elementary which means they will have to travel 8 and 14 blocks respectively to get to our program site. At Miguel Contreras Learning Center, we hope to attract students from the surrounding elementary and middle schools which may be beyond walking distance is some cases. Students who are at the age group level will be required to travel in some instances long distances to competitions on weekends. We plan to consult with parents to decide on the most practical solutions, which could be the use of public transportation, carpooling, the purchase of vans, or some combination of these options.","In order to maintain individual student and overall program progress, instructors conduct assessments periodically to evaluate student’s proficiency in mastering water safety and stroke development skills as well as program implementation. We pay close attention to attendance records to evaluate student engagement. Additionally, school administrators, teachers, and parents have opportunities to provide feedback on their satisfaction with the program and to influence program implementation strategies, administrative processes and related activities.
 
 We also will have the opportunity in 2016 to collaborate with Los Angeles Education Partnership, a nonprofit organization that is building Bethune into a full service community school. This will grant us access to data they gather using an independent evaluator, allowing us to monitor the academic achievement and the health of our students in a more scientific manner and to better meet the needs of the whole child.","An organization doing work similar to ours is the USA Swimming Foundation’s Make a Splash initiative - a national campaign that aims for every child in America to have the opportunity to learn how to swim. It has developed a Make a Splash Local Partner network comprised of nearly 700 qualified lesson providers across the nation to end drowning. Local Partners are mostly USA Swimming Clubs, YMCA’s or swim schools that for the most part offer a limited outreach program in addition to their regular activities or provide a small number of scholarships for youth who can not afford to participate in regularly-priced swim programs.
 
 The Trojan Swim Club Outreach Program is unique in that it is the only program and USA Swimming member club in Los Angeles that provides year-round, youth swim instruction and training for age-group competition in partnership with schools in low-income communities of color. Were it not for this model of a private and public entity coming together to share the use and costs of school grounds, it would be financially impractical to provide a free, swim program informed by a culture of high expectations to large numbers of disadvantaged youth that are now within our reach. It is this combination of scale and quality that currently sets us apart from others.
 
 By forming partnerships with LAUSD schools and leveraging shared resources, we have made high-quality swim instruction easily accessible to large numbers of children and youth because our pools are located at their schools - safe and familiar spaces that require no additional travel - and instruction occurs after school or during school breaks, when parents with full-time work or multiple jobs could not otherwise afford childcare. 
 
 In addition to swim instruction, our program provides the opportunity for students to connect with athletes and coaches from the USC Swim Team and Trojan Swim Club senior group who volunteer as instructors and support staff. These relationships and mentorships are important to the youth we serve, who may who may never have dreamed of attending a university like USC. Our partnership with USC also allows us to organize trips to the campus for time trials and clinics with some of the finest athletes in the world. These experiences expose our swimmers to the high quality of instruction and competition at the college level and make the possibility of swimming for a university like USC within reach.","-Bethune Middle School, 75th Elementary School, Fremont High School, Miguel Contreras Learning Complex provide the resources we need - safe pools fit for instruction and competition - to operate our program and achieve our goals
 
 -USC Athletics, Community Outreach Department has implemented an initiative called the Servicing Community through Outreach, Recreation and Education initiative to encourage the involvement of USC athletes in community programs like ours. This partnership has helped to connect youth in our program with athletes from the USC Swim Team and Trojan Swim Club who volunteer as coaches. It has also made it possible for students and their parents to take field trips to USC to participate in time trials and swim clinics conducted by Head Coach Dave Salo, his staff and athletes on the USC team. Experiences like these support our goal to provide youth with mentoring relationships and the confidence that college is within their reach. 
 
 -Los Angeles Educational Partnership (LAEP) is a nonprofit organization that creates and expands full-service community schools. They provide services at Bethune Middle School, 75th Elementary, and Fremont High in remedial education, academic support and enrichment, family engagement, primary health and dental, and mental health that will have a direct impact on our effort to address the needs of the whole child in our programs. By coordinating activities between the three schools, LAEP will enhance our goal of engaging youth at an early age and providing them with the opportunity to swim competitively through high school.
 Beyond the Bell Branch, LAUSD supports our program at Bethune by providing staff to supervise the pool facility.
 
 -Up2Us Sports leads a coach mentorship initiative - Coach Across America - that trains coaches in the principles of sports-based youth development .

 -USA Swimming Foundation provides marketing support through its Make a Splash initiative to help educate children and their families on the importance of learning how to swim, professional development to learn best practices, and scholarships for children to participate in swim lessons.","Our projected program budget is $430,372.00. We are optimistic about covering the additional cost of $330,372 to expand our program in 2016 due to the success of our program at Bethune Middle School and the impact it has had on the health and well-being of the 200 youth we have served. We believe our accomplishment at Bethune will inspire those who have supported us in the past to continue their support in 2016. At the same time we are taking bold steps to generate new sources of revenue.
 
 We project revenue of $393,350 in the form of cash and in-kind donations, an innovative fundraising event and hybrid program structure:
 
 -$11,350 from in-kind donations from Goggles for Guppies, Speedo, and LAUSD that can reduce our expenditures on swimming equipment and pool maintenance and operating costs
  
 -$60,000 in grants and donations from LA84, LA TriClub, and USA Swimming Foundation
 
 -$150,000 in donations resulting from the introduction of the Speedo Fall Challenge, a benefit to be held on November 21, 2015 at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center at USC. The event will highlight some of the finest talent in the U.S. in a made-for-broadcast swim-off fundraiser for our program 
 
 -$72,000 to help sustain and grow our age-group program, a limited number of youth who attend schools in LAUSD and who can afford to pay a membership fee typical for a USA Swimming sanctioned age group club team, will be invited to participate in the program at MCLC which can generate revenue that will help to reduce the   costs of operating a predominantly fee-free program.
 
 -$100,000 with a grant from the LA2050 Grant Challenge, our projected revenue is $393,350, leaving a budget shortfall of $37,022. We plan to make up this deficit through individual and corporate contributions.","PROGRAM BUDGET

 Only after maximizing capacity at our existing program sites - by increasing enrollment and instructional hours - will we continue our expansion to include new sites at partner schools. At present, there are an additional eight new LAUSD high schools with pools, many currently under-utilized, that are ideal sites for program expansion, allowing us to reach an even larger low-income population.

5102291,Teach For America: Growing the pipeline of DACAmented teachers for LA students,2016209,,,"Given the issues facing our immigrant students in Los Angeles and with the announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012, we are committed to increasing pathways for DACA recipients to join as Teach For America corps members teaching in Los Angeles public schools. We believe DACAmented corps members have the unique potential to serve as role models for students who share the same background.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,0CreatePlayLive,"Los Angeles must deliver on the promise of an excellent education for all, including our immigrant children. Los Angeles County has the highest number of undocumented immigrants in the state and within the Los Angeles Unified School District there are reportedly 200,000 undocumented students (Public Policy Institute of California). However, numerous barriers exist for the undocumented community that limits their ability to access educational opportunities. For example, less than 2% of college-going students nationwide are undocumented according to the UndocuScholars Project at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 
 Teach For America can help our city achieve its promise by providing a pipeline of impactful DACAmented educators. Implemented in August 2012, the DACA program allows undocumented young people who came to the U.S. before the age of 16 the opportunity to gain employment and defers any removal action for two years. 
 
 For the past 25 years, TFA LA has served as a talent pipeline of effective classroom teachers and leaders in the highest need public schools. Our corps members and alumni have a proven track record of leading students to excel. Last year , one of our teachers teaching chemistry at Ánimo College Preparatory Academy, led 75% of his students to score proficient or advanced in chemistry. In addition, KIPP Raíces, led by a Teach For America alumna, received the 2015 National Blue Ribbon Schools. This school has a student population that is 96% Latino and 90% of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch and yet is proving that all kids can achieve with school wide scores surpassing the state average 
 
 As part of our effort to develop more outstanding educators, we are committed to recruiting DACAmented teachers. Imagine if a undocumented student approached a teacher about the hardships of living as an undocumented child. Imagine if that teacher had the experience of navigating the education system from the same shoes. 
 
 One current corps member shared, “I wanted to ensure that there would be even just one less child who felt isolated and helpless because of his or her immigration status. I no longer felt afraid, limited, or ashamed because my story – and the story of many other undocumented immigrants – exemplifies perseverance, hard work, and strength, values that I hope to instill in my students.” This connection between teacher and student can bring limitless possibilities for undocumented children.","Teach For America’s recruitment model focuses heavily on college campuses and there is a small number of DACAmented college students. We believe we can play an important role in making sure that more of our K-12 undocumented students are aware of the opportunities that exist to attend college and apply for DACA. Moreover, we hope to deepen our partnerships with the AB540/Dream Centers in major college campuses in the greater Los Angeles area to ensure more DACA recipients are aware of the existing opportunities to become teachers. Even though we are early in our recruitment stage for next year’s teaching cohort, we already have nearly 20 applicants who are DACAmented from UCs or Cal State schools in the greater LA area.","We will evaluate our work by engaging in and assessing the following activities.
 • Fostering the leadership of our DACAmented teachers and maximizing their impact with students 
 • Increasing the pipeline of exceptional DACAmented teachers for LAUSD public schools
 • Increasing awareness on issues facing undocumented students for our staff and teachers 
 
 We aim to ensure we can recruit and place up to 10 additional DACAmented educators who will on average teach approximately 100 students beginning in fall 2016. We will measure our teachers' effectiveness by assessing their students' progress. We will also evaluate this project by the number of training opportunities we are able to provide to staff and corps members on issues facing undocumented students.","There are many important organizations working to address the injustices facing Los Angeles’ students impacted by their personal or family citizenship status and we strive to be a key partner among them. Specifically, there are many efforts to eliminate barriers to college for undocumented students. For example, Educators for Fair Consideration (E4FC) is aimed at empowering undocumented young people to pursue their dreams of college, career, and citizenship in the United States. They annually host a national conference to increase awareness for educators working with undocumented students. 
 
 Additionally, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) has established a CHIRLA Dream Center in response to President Obama's announcement regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in June 2012 which aims to assist eligible immigrant youth and community members in applying for Deferred Acton. 
 
 IDEAS (Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success) at UCLA aims to provide undocumented students with the resources and support needed to ensure their retention in higher education.
 They implement the AB540 Project which raises the awareness of undocumented youth, parents, educators, and the general Los Angeles community about the academic and financial resources available to undocumented students.
 
 In addition, Los Angeles Unified School District has consolidated resources to support students applying for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. The LAUSD school board also recently approved the program, Advocating for Youth Unaccompanied in Deportation Actions, which made the district the first in California to start fighting deportation cases for students who have immigrated without guardians. 
 
 While there are existing resources for undocumented youth, there does not seem to specific initiatives to recruit individuals with DACA status to serve as teachers. We are excited to serve as the only pipeline of DACAmented educators for Los Angeles public schools, specifically in low-income communities.","We envision the potential to provide additional financial resources to corps members, students applying for DACA status, and advocacy and education community organizations. As part of this project, we will explore organizations who have expertise in training educators around issues impacting undocumented students so that our entire teaching cohort of approximately 180 first and second-year teachers can deepen their ability to serve as allies to their students and families. We typically pay partner organizations an honorarium or fee for presentations throughout the year at a rate of approximately $2,000-$2,500. In addition, we intend to research local conferences or events led by key partners that we can send our staff and teachers to as well to supplement their professional development and increase their effectiveness as advocates for immigrant student issues. 
 
 Additionally, we can establish a scholarship fund to help students in our classrooms cover the fee ($465) for their DACA application. We could work with our DACAmented teachers to host a DACA clinic/info session and provide 5-10 scholarships for students in attendance that can be used to pay for their DACA application.
 
 Lastly, our corps members (teachers) who are essential to this project have the potential to directly benefit from this in the case that they experience unexpected financial hardship or legal fees. We currently have funding to provide up to $15,000 per corps member to provide the equivalent of the Americorps grant other corps members receive that they are ineligible for as well as legal fees. However, in the case that additional financial hardship occurs, this funding in part may be covered to address this in specific situations. For example, paying fees for their teaching certification can provide a financial barrier for many of our DACAmented teachers who cannot apply or receive federal financial aid. Funds for this project could in part be used in the form of up to $1,000 grants that can be provided to corps members to help pay for their certification.","We anticipate this project will cost $227,000. We will seek additional foundation supporters as well as individual supporters to join our Sponsor A Teacher Campaign to help offset these costs with a donation of $5,000 and above.","This budget includes our efforts to recruit, train, and place up to 10 new DACAmented corps members to teach in LA public schools in the 2016-17 school year, as well as to coach, support, and provide professional development to the 14 corps members who are currently teaching as part of the TFA LA corps.","In order to scale this project, we will need to deepen partnerships with key organizations both on college campuses and in the broader Los Angeles community to work together to recruit more DACAmented teachers by 1) expanding the pipeline and ensuring more eligible undocumented leaders are applying for deferred action and 2) cultivating more DACAmented college students and professionals to see the need for teachers with their background and apply to join the Teach For America Los Angeles corps. 
 Additionally, we hope to expand the training and professional development we aim to provide for our corps members (first and second year teachers) around issues facing undocumented students to our large Teach For America LA alumni base including the nearly 700 teachers and over 70 principals currently working in LA area schools. 
 
 Lastly, we see an opportunity to engage with other community service (such as other Americorps initiatives) and/or teaching pipeline programs to discuss how to collectively work to recruit from an expanded pool of DACAmented students and professionals to join the teaching profession."
5102168,Teach Kids Coding with Minecraft,2015108,,,"LA Makerspace will partner with LA-based benefit corporation Connected Camps to create free coding camps with a common core-aligned curriculum, leveraging Minecraft, the wildly popular computer game, to teach kids to build, design, and code. Open source, free, and tailored to after-school educators, youth organization staff, parents and those without education backgrounds, the camps will enable people in underserved communities all over LA to use Minecraft to develop STEAM skills in youth.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Afterschool Programs,Learn,"Often described as virtual Legos, Minecraft has been embraced by progressive educators as a learner-centered environment for developing problem-solving, creative, technical, and coding skills. Minecraft thus represents a unique opportunity to scale a gateway to STEAM-related interests, identities, and skills that can be implemented across a student education pipeline. This project leverages Minecraft to 1) bring more kids into coding and technically sophisticated forms of gaming, and 2) sharpen our understanding of the relational and cultural supports kids need to develop STEAM interests as they move from K-12 institutions to higher education systems.
  
 Relative to our proposal, while Minecraft gives kids a foot in the door, they need support to engage technically sophisticated aspects of Minecraft and fully develop STEAM interests. Prior research indicates that in order to engage in technical gaming interests kids need two supports: 1) peers and mentors they identify with, and 2) projects that engage their identities and interests. Our coding camp would offer these supports, both through the peer-based multiplayer environment in which the camp takes place, as well as via the curriculum itself.
 
 In addition, because Minecraft is deeply engaging as a learning environment, kids want to learn and have opportunities to cultivate positive attitudes toward learning. We know from research that attitudes toward learning play an important role in a child’s willingness to stay in school. It is our hope that by helping kids to develop positive attitudes toward learning, we can impact truancy rates in schools.
 
 And, because our camp model employs high school and college-aged counselors we are also working to reduce youth underemployment and unemployment.
 
 Lastly, we will be partnering with after-school organizations to deliver the camps, which will include professional development for their staff so they can repeat the camps independently.","The greatest difficulty we anticipate is bridging the gap between Minecraft-savvy kids and Minecraft-wary adults. Millions of kids are obsessed with Minecraft, but many parents and other adults are confused about what happens in the game and what effect it may have on kids. Our coding curriculum makes STEAM learning outcomes apparent to adults, because they can see them writing code to solve in-game design challenges. Via the college-age mentors that kids have a chance to interact with and learn from, kids and parents experience a pathway of coding expertise that leads, in many cases, to computer science-based degrees. In addition, the curriculum itself includes an introduction to Minecraft basic gameplay, facilitated for the parents by their child.","We use a number of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the camp. One measure is engagement: are kids actively engaged in our coding challenges; do they log in to our servers whenever possible? Another measure is a sense of belonging: do kids feel part of a community to which they are actively contributing and in which they are recognized as an important participant? A third measure relates to the mapping of our curriculum to the Next Generation Science Standards. Based on these specific learning outcomes, our coding challenges serve as performance-based assessments measuring the extent to which a kid has learned a particular coding skill or set of skills. We also gather daily data from our counselors on their interactions with the kids, noting learning challenges and successes and capturing information on how kids are doing with each of the different coding challenges. Counselor data is summarized and reviewed daily so that modifications to the curriculum can be made as needed.","There are currently two form of coding camps available in Los Angeles. These are: fully-featured, robust multi-session experiences held by for-profits such as iD Tech Camps, UCode, Planet Bravo, and CodeRev kids. At a cost of $550-$1700 a week, these camps are not accessible to many Angelenos. The second kind are free programs, which are typically one-off workshops or have limited seats because they are sponsored or run by a nonprofit.
 
 LA Makerspace is one of these nonprofits. We have experience in offering workshops in neighborhoods around LA County via our partnership with the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) system. Our workshops in Minecraft are multi-session, but spaces are limited by the funding available for LAPL. Partnering with Connected Camps to hold 200 hours of coding instruction remotely, for free, overcomes many of these obstacles. Particularly, through our partnership with afterschool programs, it empowers non-educator, non-Minecraft experts who work with LA’s underserved youth, to offer the camps for free again and again.","LA Makerspace will be partnering with Connected Camps, a benefit corporation. Connected Camps was co-founded by LA Makerspace’s founder, technologist and entrepreneur Tara Tiger Brown; with Mimi Ito, Professor in Residence and MacArthur Foundation Chair in Digital Media and Learning at UC Irvine, Research Director of the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub, and Chair of the Connected Learning Research Network; and Katie Salen, game designer and force behind the creation of Institute of Play and its partner school Quest to Learn. 
 
 LA Makerspace - $70,000
 Connected Camps - $30,000","60 workshop series; 825 Los Angeles students learning to code = $100,000
 
 The camp and its curriculum will be facilitated in the form of a series of workshops that will be made available to kids all over Los Angeles. The workshops will be delivered either in-person or online depending on the resources available in each afterschool setting. The in-person workshop is best for those afterschool programs that do not have laptops or sufficient internet access. LA Makerspace will run the entire workshop series and provide coding counselors, Minecraft server memberships for all participants, and something called a Minecraft-in-a-Box kit (1 Minecraft server + 15 laptops). The online coding workshop is for facilities that have computers and sufficient internet access and want to focus on flexibility and providing their staff with professional development. 
 
 We are proposing that each in-person coding workshop series is composed of 4 2-hour workshops and that we would offer 35 instances of the series with 525 students. Each online coding workshop series is composed of 8, 1.5 hour workshops and we will offer 25 instances of this series with 300 students.","In-person coding camps:

5102292,Tech LA Cares (TLC),2016210,,,"The Los Angeles tech space is growing at a rapid pace -- so much so, that it is difficult for tech companies to devote time, resources, and energy into being a strong partner within their own communities.
 
 Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge that gap by matching companies with organizations and events, both by in-person needs assessments, as well as online volunteer signup mechanisms.
 
 We believe in the efficiency of online tools, but also believe that human contact is key to success.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"The Los Angeles tech sector is on the verge of Very Big Things -- led by Mayor Eric Garcetti and fueled by an influx of venture capital, the City is now the third largest tech ecosystem in the US, #1 in Open Data, and graduates more engineering students than any other region in the nation (many of whom are now choosing to stay in LA, rather than head north upon graduation).
 
 As founder of LA Tech Digest (hence the preliminary links above to LATD), I have spent the past year chronicling a city with an upward trajectory that clearly shows that right here, right now, LA in 2015, is the absolute best place in the world to be, in order to pursue your dreams and secure a brighter future.
 
 And yet for all the great things happening in Los Angeles, we cannot allow a disconnect between the rising fortunes of the area's tech businesses and their surrounding communities.
 
 Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to bridge this gap by making it easy for startups and established companies to identify, and participate in, the success of charitable organizations and events in their area -- community centers, food banks, neighborhood cleanups, donation drives, volunteer / mentorship opportunities, hackathons, school trips, and more.
 
 True Corporate Responsibility is hard, and it requires a dedicated staff to match opportunities with resources. 
 
 Unfortunately, most companies do not have the energy to find the right opportunity for their employees to get involved.
 
 We aim to streamline this process, with an array of tools, both online and real-world: 
 
 The TLC website will feature a LA nonprofit directory and neighborhood map, an events calendar, organization spotlights, and events recaps that showcase these two worlds connecting for the good of their communities.
 
 The weekly TLC email will deliver this info directly to interested companies and individuals as well.
 
 The TLC social media will also highlight events, organizations, and companies, in order to better show and share with the world the strong ties between LA tech and their local communities.
 
 In-person visits by TLC to the organizations and companies will help assess the needs of the organizations, as well as the capabilities of the companies involved.
 
 Participating companies and organizations will also be TLC-certified, so that they can display their involvement, both online and in the real world.","The biggest obstacle in this process is the allocation of resources by potentially participating companies.
 
 LA's tech companies are on a fast track to success, logging long hours in order to grow their businesses at a very competitive pace.
 
 LA's tech companies embrace a work hard / play hard mantra that can make it very difficult to layer charitable work in as well.
 
 But two macro issues come into play: 
 
 1) Millennials want to do well by doing good, to live a life of purpose, as evidenced by their willingness to volunteer, by their choices in conscious commerce, by their choices of group & individual experiences.
 
 2) There is, and there has always been, a tension between social classes as the fortunes of some sectors rise faster than others'; you see it and hear it every day, in areas such as Venice and Downtown.
 
 Tech LA Cares looks to connect these worlds for the benefit of all, in a manner that makes it easy for companies to get involved, without draining internal resources.","Since we're in the beginning stages, it will be very easy to benchmark progress based on actions and data gathered: 
 
 From the real world side, we can continually measure:
 
 How many companies were visited?
 What causes mean the most to them?
 What is their current involvement in the community?
 Which companies are interested in participating?
 What resources do they have to offer?
 What do we need to build in order to make this a smooth process for them?
 
 How many community organizations were visited?
 How are they receiving support right now?
 What areas need further support?
 What resources do they need in order to best serve their community?
 What is the best way to collect and broadcast such information?
 
 From the digital side, we can easily measure progress of the site buildout, and watch metrics daily:
 
 Site traffic
 Email signups
 Open / click-through / bounce / retention rates
 Social shares / likes / comments / followers
 Company / individual signups
 Events listed / hours volunteered","There are quite a few national organizations that do what we propose!
 
 Total respect to the numerous organizations and sites that aim to connect individuals and corporations to relevant charitable entities.
 
 But what is missing from these national sites is, well, a sense of community. 
 
 And what Los Angeles needs is a local organization that understands its startup world, that understands the needs of local charities and community organizations, that can go out into the field and physically match both sides of the table.
 
 An organization built by LA, for LA, to show the rest of the world what we are capable of.
 
 An organization that can properly marry real-world with digital, social events with social media, to instill a sense of philanthropy and giving into our local workforce, that is more than just writing a check or wearing a t-shirt to an event.
 
 I lived in San Francisco during the original dotcom bubble, a time in which every other company was going public, and throwing a huge party to announce it -- even as thousands roamed south of Market and throughout town in search of food, spare change, and maybe a place to sleep where they wouldn't get harassed or mugged.
 
 I see the seeds of this happening in LA, here, now. And I believe we can address this early on -- sure, a lot of companies may already be contributing to local organizations, but perhaps they're not telling their story properly.
 
 Good deeds do not always need to be publicly broadcast, but there does need to be a constant stream of positive information going out to our communities, backed by real deeds, not just lip service.
 
 So in addition to the real benefits that come from local companies being actively engaged in their communities, there is a narrative to tell the world that Tech LA Cares.","We have not sought any additional partners or collaborators at this point, since a large portion of the grant will be devoted to covering the manpower needed to build out the program and the actual website.
 
 But by running LA Tech Digest, we have built a network of trust across all strata of LA's tech scene, and plan on strengthening these alliances by working closely with government agencies, charitable organizations, and local tech companies in order to identify entities in need, match company resources to community needs, and help spread the word about the efforts of those involved.","The entire plan is to keep this capped at $100,000 for at this early stage.
 
 The effort right now is 1) to build the site platform, 2) collect the information necessary to populate the site + have a continuous flow of information, and 3) connect local tech companies with community opportunities.
 
 All this will be done in a fiscally conservative manner, so that we have proof of concept in order to seek out additional funding via private donations, corporate matching, public grants, and other government instruments.
 
 There is much that we would like to add over time, but it really is a matter of taking baby steps in getting the product just right, in getting local tech companies excited to efficiently work with their communities.","We anticipate $50,000 to go to the manpower needed for community and corporate outreach in order to collect the data to populate the site, $40,000 budgeted to the build out of the site itself, and $10,000 in PR / social amplification.
 
 We are treating this endeavor like a tech startup in which LA2025 is the seed round, then seek further funding from other resources as needed, and as momentum builds.
 
 The biggest mistake anyone makes is trying to do too much too soon; it is our plan to keep a tight lid on expenditures in our earliest stages, and simply focus on building the core product before adding too many bells & whistles.","Success begets success, and people want to do good -- they just need the proper channel in order to easily do so.
 
 I've seen a lot of charity / volunteer services focus on the individual, which is good in encouraging friends to join friends; however, the network effect of 1 + 1 is largely 3.
 
 Now, you get companies involved, within a defined vertical (in this case being Los Angeles-area tech companies), and you've tapped into the network effect of a tight-knit, devoted group, thus bringing the network effect of 10 + 10 = 50.
 
 Do this enough times, and you've instilled a sense of involvement beyond LA's tech community, so that local companies from other verticals become involved -- first, from the initial periphery, next, from areas one would not anticipate.
 
 Tell these stories enough times, and you've created a movement, in which other cities want to know how to unify their businesses in order to strengthen ties between local businesses and charities.
 
 There are a lot of large companies that already have their own Corporate Responsibility departments. 
 
 However, LA is seeing a huge surge in tech-based startups that do not have the luxury of such departments to handle this work.
 
 We aim to make it easy for companies to better connect with their communities, so that the rising tide lifts all boats, and so that LA can serve as a model for yet another incredible civic achievement.
 
 (And yes, to be more concrete, it will be necessary to scale this model via earned and paid media across traditional, social, and online channels.)"

Not only will technology enhance learning but it will boost student participation and will reach all types of learners. We want to grow and transform Redeemer into an elite Christian private school for ALL children in the LA area. Because Redeemer is a small, affordable, private school our funding is limited.

It will be interesting to see how student participation and test scores are affected from the use of technology.,"Los Angeles has an over whelming number of elementary schools, the majority being public schools with technology already implemented in the classroom. Our situation is unique because we are a small, affordable, private, Christian school where funding is very limited.

We propose to expand our 2015 inaugural event of 7 participants and venues along a 2 mile linear portion of the LA River to 20 locations alon",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"River adjacent communities of Frog Town, Atwater Village, Cypress Park, Echo Park, Silver Lake and Downtown, cyclists, joggers, walkers and other roller visitors from all over the region.",ALL,"The 2015 10 FEET event brings together arts, culture, neighborhood and environmental groups to achieve unique and inspiring play along the river. The event leverages existing facilities like The Women’s Center for Creative Work, the Elysian Valley Arts Collective and Folar’s Frog Spot along with additional locations within the newly purposed 10 feet on the west bank of the LA River to engage visual, sensory and physical relationships with the River. Participants will exercise their bodies and their minds traveling between installations, seeing and sensing interpretations of the natural feature that gave life to the City of Los Angeles. 
 
 We envision an expanded event and children’s after school and family programs for 2016. For TEN FEET 2016 we propose to curate 20 individual sites from the Glendale Narrows to the Arroyo Seco. Participating artists and performers will create playful art and culture installations. Our after school program will partner with existing organizations and events to leverage and compliment existing resources. 
 
 Our inclusionary curatorial process requires research of the numerous neighborhood, arts and cultural and environmental groups in the River neighborhoods to identify potential exhibitors, venues, participants, contributors and volunteers. 
 
 We would like to supplement our exhibit with an after school program for students and families along the river. This will require resources for outreach to schools, community organizations, existing recreation programs at parks and non profits to provide a series of events and programs for students to become involved in arts and culture in their neighborhoods. This program will be focused on the playful qualities of arts and culture. 
 
 TEN FEET is the first and only community based initiative to advocate for an arts and culture infrastructure on Los Angeles River projects. We are advocates for the inclusion of arts and culture design and planning for public and private River projects as an essential ingredient to more inspiring, attractive and effective play along the river. The TEN FEET event demonstrates how we can transform the LA River Greenway and parkland into a globally significant and vital urban oasis where people of all ages and interests come to play.","The most challenging issue facing all River projects, including TEN FEET, is funding support. We successfully crowd funded our first TEN FEET event (2015) . Building on the demonstrated success of our first event we plan to solicit grant funding and corporate donations to support the 2016 TEN FEET event and after school children’s program. We have a great deal of support from complementary organizations, our ability to contribute resources will greatly facilitate their participation and our mutual effectiveness. 
 
 Our activities in 2015 have achieved broad interest and support from a number of local organizations including the Elysian Valley Arts Collective, the Women’s Center for Creative Work, FOLAR, and The Mayor’s Riverworks office. As the River continues to evolve, we will continue to be guided by and focus on the needs of the communities and organizations who consider the River their neighborhood place to play.","For 2015/6 TEN FEET will be successful if we are able to:
 • Secure funding for a curator and administrator to manage events and programs
 • Execute an expanded and memorable 2016 TEN FEET event
 • Successfully obtain grants and other funding 
 • Plan and conduct children’s and family after school arts and culture programs to provide healthy and fun activities for kids and families.
 • Further engage the Riverfront communities in dialogue regarding the value of arts and culture in their neighborhoods. 
 
 Benchmarks
 • # of children participating in TEN FEET programs and events
 • # of participants in TEN FEET event 
 
 Methodology
 • On-site surveys and suggestions from participants to evaluate how arts and culture can provide new and unique play experiences on the River.","The LA River Art Project is a unique advocacy organization whose goal is to leverage arts and culture to create LA’s finest environment for play along the River. We have met with numerous organizations and public agencies over the past 14 months and found that here are no similar groups focused on this subject. All of the groups we have met and worked with have expressed enthusiastic support for The LA River Art Project’s goals to create an intergenerational arts and culture infrastructure in all River projects. The TEN FEET event and future family and children’s programs will work with existing organizations to expand arts and culture in river neighborhoods. Our approach is unique because we are dedicated to working with local organizations and residents. Other similar public art programs have lacked a commitment and connection to local communities. 
 
 There are many precedents around the country and the world that demonstrate the power of public arts programs to enrich public spaces making them more exciting and rewarding places to play. Some recent examples include The Seattle Water Front, Millennium Park in Chicago, Governor’s Island and The High Line in New York. Numerous studies recognize that arts and cultural ingredients are key to socially and economically sustainable public spaces. The urgency to develop a lasting engagement with art at the River is inspired by our belief that the LA River is our next great public space. We should all enjoy playing at the River.","LA River Public Art Project partners will include:
 
 Sandy Rodriguez an artist and educator in Los Angeles associated with The J. Paul Getty Museum and Art + Practice. Sandy will develop the children’s and family after school art program curriculum and coordinate with program partners including schools and community organizations.

To grow beyond a relatively small event and a series of after school and weekend activities we need to create a program structure and build our non profit to have the resources to work with multiple cities, the County of Los Angeles, open space conservancies, community based organizations and the US Army Corps of Engineers. 
 
 We will build an advisory board, hire administration and technical staff, and continue our efforts to advocate for arts and culture in public and private river revitalization projects. We will seek the resources and opportunity to develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan for the River that maximizes the opportunity for playful art and culture as an essential component of the anticipated and future revitalization projects. The plan will include an approach to build long term resources and partnerships to sustain arts and culture on the River for the future as essential ingredients of great play. We believe there are excellent partnerships possible with community based organizations, arts institutions, educational institutions, philanthropic organizations, and public agencies that do not currently exist. 
 
 If we are going to spend over a billion dollars of our public funds on habitat restoration, water quality and passive recreation in the next decade we should make sure that it will provide great intergenerational play opportunities along with education, work force opportunities and fuel for our City’s global creative economy. Our efforts will be scaled according to the resources available. Partnerships and financial support will expedite the process. 
 
 We envision a generation of children and families growing up in Los Angeles who will think of the River as a memorable place that shaped their experiences and provided great places to play."
5102295,The Academy Project--Helping Foster Youth THRIVE!!,2016211,,,"50% of the 21,000 kids in foster care in LA end up homeless, in gangs, institutionalized or in jail, with 8% having dropped out of school (3 x the statewide rate), due to frequent school changes. Starting in Grade 7, TAP is building a year-round, in-school solution that integrates individual needs & guarantees youth a consistent placement through high school. Within a community of peers, TAP provides a safe place where youth thrive & discover otherwise ignored talents and wasted potential.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,We are targeting South LA first as this is where the largest population of foster youth reside,Learn,"California Standards Test (CST) results show the proficiency rate for the statewide student population to be 53% for English & 60% for Math, but only 29% & 37% respectively for foster youth. 75% of foster youth are working below grade level & only 58% will graduate high school (V’s 84% statewide). 
 
 The LA County Board of Supervisors Blue Ribbon Commission concluded “A State of Emergency exists. If we knew that 50% of all children in foster care end up homeless, or incarcerated upon aging out of the system & only 4% received any higher education, we would not tolerate such a negligent system.”
 
 We are failing this population, our citizens for LA2050. The best place to learn is where every child has equal opportunity to succeed. TAP’s new, innovative education engagement model will achieve this. The LA2050 grant would allow us to bring the following design to life.
 
 The Academy will start in Grade 7. A founding tenet is keeping school as the point of stability in a foster youth’s life. Students are guaranteed a tuition free placement through to completion of high school. The Academy will operate as a school-within-a-school, with an extended year round schedule providing the opportunity to participate in a variety of enrichment programs outside of class. 
 
 Students will be selected from a pool, created by self-submit applications & recommendations from experts (Social Workers, Lawyers, CASA). Engagement begins prior to the start of the school year, during a summer camp, focused on building trust & setting bi-directional expectations. 
 
 A comprehensive battery of tests will be completed (medical, dental, academic etc.) that will shape students’ individualized holistic plans. A licensed therapist will be matched with each student. Once the type & frequency of therapy sessions are prescribed, they will be included in each student’s plan, along with any required remediation & other appointments that would usually disrupt progress at school (e.g. court appearances). 
 
 The Academy will create a community for students, a home, with a core curriculum teacher & a site-based clinical social worker assigned to each class for the duration. After two years full time within The Academy, students will join mainstream high school. They will continue to have this ‘home’ for extra-curricular programs & support (therapy, tutoring, SAT preparation etc.). 
 
 TAP will ensure they graduate career & college ready & prepared to be well-rounded citizens for LA2050.","Work is underway to address each of our main challenges: finding a partner school; solving transportation issues; securing delivery partners; avoiding stigma. 
 
 The last is the most complex. Foster status can manifest in low self-esteem & negative self image. Foster youth exhibit so much anxiety, worried their foster status might be exposed, they completely withdraw from social interactions. Perceptions of them as troubled & delinquent compound this. Concerns are, attending The Academy could isolate youth further. 
 Findings from the Vera Institute (foster youth found solace with other foster youth) disprove this idea. Steps we are taking to address stigma include: starting in 7th grade so they can mainstream into high school as a “regular” kid; leveraging the experience of experts & former foster youth; understanding lessons learnt from other successful programs; creating a culture of self-respect, replacing worthlessness with value, & a feeling of pride for overcoming adversity.","Our solution has been designed with input from former foster youth & experts in the field, including a study by Princeton University. Our Focus Groups have determined evaluation metrics across 2 areas:
 Student: Individual baseline metrics established via tests applied on joining TAP. Academic proficiency & general well being will be monitored for improvement
 School Community: Several recent studies (The Invisible Achievement Gap) have provided baseline metrics for LA’s foster youth. TAP will also work with Partner Schools to establish these. Targets: improve student attendance rates; totally eliminate transfer rates to alternative schools; reduce discipline & expulsion rates; increase CST participation rates & eventual scores; reduce drop-out rates; improve AP & CTE enrollment & passage rates; improve graduation rates; improve college attendance rates. 
 We are working to define other metrics related to improvement to life outcomes (unemployment, homelessness, future health & happiness)","Complementary, yes. We are in the process of engaging many organizations as our intent is to take an “open-source” approach to The Academy, encouraging other interested entities to leverage their proven approaches in helping youth. By establishing partnerships, we can not only enrich students’ experiences, but enable these organizations to enhance their own depth & reach, while cutting back on ineffective replication. 
 
 In the past few years the issues surrounding Transition Age foster Youth--TAY--(18 - 24 years) have gathered much needed attention. There are many organizations in LA catering to needs such as housing, mentoring, job search, higher education prep etc. While this is invaluable, there remains a gap in addressing many root causes that manifest much earlier. The LAUSD Foster Youth Achievement Program was created to monitor this gap, but they recognize that they need support from community partners to make an impactful difference. 
 
 As far as we are aware, from extensive research & networking, our in-school solution for foster youth is unique. Some schools are trialling the school-within-a-school approach for general remediation & are seeing early signs of success. Several organizations do provide mentoring support for foster youth (e.g. Children Uniting Nations), outside of the school structure. There are several organisations that seek to provide after-school enrichment programs in LA, but few are targeted specifically at foster youth & their specific needs, much less seeking to create a community & sense of camaraderie among peers.
 
 The closest ‘rival’ to TAP in LA is First Star (https://www.firststar.org). They have a summer Academy delivered in partnership with UCLA (The Bruin Guardian Scholars Academy). While we hope to begin our program with a similar summer camp structure, the Academy will go much deeper in providing support to students throughout the school year.
 
 We have a State of Emergency, and the LA County Board of Supervisors recognizes that. Failing to educate & prepare foster youth for adult life fully & as early as possible, creates other issues for our City (gang membership, homelessness, incarceration, food stamps, subsidised health care etc.) If we do what we’ve always done, we’ll get what we’ve always got. It’s time to try something new.","TAP will work to launch our solution with the first cohort of 20 students starting at the beginning of academic year ‘16 - ‘17. The goal is to build a scalable model that can be replicated in other LA schools, & demonstrate thought leadership for other cities looking to address this issue.
 
 For the purpose of this grant application “the project” is the transition between completing the design phase & being ready for the first day of school . Our goal is to build the most robust solution as possible for that first, pilot year. Money will also be allotted to a Summer Camp, to kick off The Academy & ease students into their new world. We anticipate working with a range of partners to bring TAP to life. 
 
 Organisations we have approached & are in tentative discussions on partnering opportunities include: CASA, HopSkipDrive, Department of Children & Family Services, LAUSD, Los Angeles County Office of Education, First Star, The Alliance for Children’s Rights, United Friends of Children, Boys and Girls Club, iFoster, United Way, A Place Called Home, CITY, California Youth Connection, Guardian Scholars, iFoster, Unicamp, Future is Now, Children’s Institute, Coalition for Engaged Education, Education Coordinating Council, California Child Welfare Co-Investment Partnership, United Teachers Association, LA County Education Foundation, Children’s Law Institute, among others
 
 We anticipate many of our partners services will be provided for free during the life of this specific project , as part of a proof of concept driven by joint goals & values. We will also rely heavily on skilled volunteers. The majority of the costs associated with partner services will be assumed into the ongoing operating costs of The Academy Project, post Day 1. This is out of scope of the budget for this application.","For the purpose of this proposal, “the project” is the transition between completing the design phase & being ready for the 1st day of school, effectively Feb. 1st-Sept. 1st.
 
 For the past year we have relied on in-kind donations to carry us through, e.g. office space, phone & internet services, fees, expert consultations & guidance & professionals volunteering their time. We hope to continue to receive some if not all of these benefits as we move forward.
 
 To have as robust a solution as possible for Day 1 of school, we anticipate needing between $120 - $150k total. This does not include the funds we will secure for the complete operation of the school from Day 1 onwards; work is underway to secure this before the start of the school year. Costs will reduce as we define more clearly which of the several paths the design & delivery takes e.g. variables that may change in the next few months: Contributions to/from the Partner School; Recruitment of personnel; Transportation; Finalizing corporate sponsorships.
 
 We intend to influence these variables as much as possible to keep costs low & to continue to capitalize on in-kind donations. We have made the following assumptions for our proposal budget to bring us in line with $100k:
 Dedicated workspace will be required to enable collaboration on the design. We would make use of sharing spaces such as Blankspace / Nextspace to minimize cost
 Salaries for core faculty should be at the higher end of the scale (as per LA market rates), given the demands placed on & commitment expected from faculty
 Partners services will be provided largely at their cost during this time, as part of a proof of concept driven by joint goals & values
 We are in the process of expanding our Board to include professional expertise such as Finance, Legal, Marketing etc.
 Wherever possible, skilled volunteers will be used to achieve remaining objectives, using web resources such as Catchafire, Idealist, VolunteerMatch, all of which we are already members
 We are already capitalizing on free IT tools & services. e.g. Salesforce.com, Google suite 
 Not included in this budget is a separate project to have the physical classroom ready for Day 1. We are optimistic our network of potential corporate sponsors can be leveraged here.
 Also not included in this budget are the funds we will secure to underpin the complete operation of the school (e.g. full year salaries for faculty). Work is already underway to secure this before the school year starts.","$14k for Office Space for 7 months 
 $15k for Curriculum & Policy Development (consultancy fee, materials, behavioral management tools, design and execution of the battery of tests etc)
 $25k to Recruit Core Faculty & have them onboarded part time (20 hours per week) for 3 months prior to school starting, to be part of the design process (fully loaded salaries: $84k for Class Teacher; $79k for Social Worker, if not provided by DCFS)
 $3k training / professional development for core team, to ensure Day 1 readiness
 $10k for strategy development (recruiting partner school, completing operating model, advisory services, volunteer stipends, materials etc)
 $15k total for residential camp for 1 week. This again may reduce as we develop partnerships in the coming months
 $13k for marketing, to help raise awareness for TAP, to attract applicants & to galvanize support. A lot will be done via social media and relationship development
 $5k total contingency (e.g. unexpected costs, or advisory services","Significant preparations have been made to ensure the TAP solution is successful & scalable. Over the last year, collaboration with experts & former foster youth, including research led by Princeton University on TAP’s behalf, has contributed to our solid plan. The first cohort of TAP will clearly be important, as we pilot the solution for the first time, monitor against our key metrics & ensure we capitalize on lessons learnt. We are confident we are building something that can make a substantial difference in these kids lives.
 
 Once through the first 2 pilot years, The Academy Project will scale our successful model by recruiting more schools thus, serving more & more foster youth. We hope to replicate this model with an eye toward expediency, by opening & expanding our afterschool programs to non-TAP foster youth within our first few years of operation, in parallel to scaling “The Academy” to more schools. As the success of TAP is replicated, more resources will be made available, & stakeholders will look to TAP as an organization that continues to innovate & create complete, thoughtful, & effective solutions to issues facing foster youth. We will continue to explore engagement in earlier grades, & continued support beyond graduation. We will continue to promote Professional Development both within TAP & amongst the greater educational community, with specialized trainings on foster youth, foster care & education, & therapies for victims of trauma. 
 
 The Academy Project hopes to expand our reach by engaging Child Welfare Agencies throughout the country, guiding them to use The Academy Project approach as a basis for their own successes in caring for foster youth. 
 
 Many years down the line, it is our hope that The Academy Project will have taken the place of continuation schools & group homes, keeping foster youth engaged & thriving in public schools & foster family placements. 
 
 It is our belief that our greatest assets are the youth we serve & it is because of them that we will be successful & able to scale to reach more & more youth. By caring, nurturing & supporting these youth, they will no doubt thrive & continue to reach for the limitless potential that they all possess."

 Through our efforts we aim to increase public usage of ATP infrastructure & we will work with lawmakers to create a more expansive & even safer system.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,ALL,"WHY IT'S IMPORTANT: By 2030, roughly 1 billion more people will be living in cities (creating a Buenos Aires-sized city every 3 weeks for the next 15 years). With already strained roadways & population growth in our future, Los Angeles is looking at the very real PROBLEM of transporting even more people across our massive landscape.
 
 Continuing to look at mobility in LA from a car-centric view poses fiscal & human health costs. According to recent research, congestion’s cost has been estimated at 1.5 to 4% of GDP. Getting people from one part of a city to another efficiently & stress-free has monetary value. 
 
 There is also a real human health cost. California scientists recently linked chronic exposure to ultra-fine particles found in vehicle exhaust to deaths from heart disease. Individuals living & working within a 10 mile radius of major roadways were most at risk. So the cost of congested roadways isn't limited to our pocketbooks. 
 
 That being said, as LA's population grows, a truly ""healthy"" future for LA cannot entail building more and wider roadways. We have to take a very serious look at supplying our populace with safe alternative infrastructure to move around the city efficiently.
 
 ATP's ANSWER: ATP has been working steadily since 2010 to educate & motivate Angelenos to use their alternative travel infrastructure. To date we have made 11 videos highlighting the enormous health, environmental & community benefits of an ATP lifestyle. We hosted a salon (In Her Shoes) to bring together municipal leadership, law enforcement & commuters to establish a dialogue on how to ensure safe, reliable travel for women. We launch biannual ""Commute CarFree"" initiatives in which individuals volunteer to travel CarFree & share their stories. We serve as a voice with municipal leadership & law enforcement on the need for SAFE & extended alternative travel infrastructure. We network celebrities with ATP related events & organizations to give a global voice to ATP's goals.
 
 At ATP, we believe that LA is unique on the global stage because it has an unparalleled potential to effect the vision of what an ideal lifestyle could be. Our media, film & television tales reach even the most remote international villages. With the extraordinary amount of creative talent & financial power in this city, surely we can be at the forefront of what it means to transport Angelenos across our city; and by doing that, we would make LA as great as it has the potential to be.","The major challenge in effectively building ATP's vision is infrastructure. We see a future where, as LA grows (projected to grow by 1.7 mil in the next 5 yrs), pedestrian travel, cyclists, cars & public transit hold EQUAL value for those building infrastructure. An expanded, safe city-wide system depends on the approval of LA constituents & business owners. 
 
 The public & businesses have difficulty supporting infrastructure expansion when there is no statistical evidence that it would improve local lifestyles (financial & community safety). 
 
 At ATP we believe developing an app would be the key to overcoming this challenge. By creating a database that would provide numerical evidence of improved business & safety in areas that have extended ATP services, we would arm businesses & governments with the data necessary to comfortably justify building those facilities for the betterment of their economies, and for the health & happiness of their citizens. This data would be free.","An ATP App would do a majority of the work of self-evaluation. It would serve a few functions; however the ones that would most specifically assess whether ATP is making progress would be:
 
 1. A community forum (much like WAZE) that would give commuters a chance to highlight problematic spots (unsafe bike routes & hours, lack of connective infrastructure, etc.). We would compile the information & share it with developers & lawmakers in an effort to improve infrastructure.
 
 2. We would compare shifts in the number of ATP commuters on specific paths to changes in safety & business revenue on ATP thoroughfares. ATP believes there is a positive, direct correlation between ATP infrastructure & community safety and business profit. We would like to arm lawmakers with the statistics that would enable them to work towards a safe and welcoming alternative travel infrastructure for every Angeleno to use.","CicLAvia, LACBC, Metro, LADOT, EMA, FastLA are all examples of excellent organizations doing similar work. ATP's scope in comparison, however, is more comprehensive. Whereas the organizations listed focus either on quarterly ATP related events or on specific elements of ATP travel (for instance safety for cyclists), our organization looks at the transit of individuals by car-free means as a whole. At the Alternative Travel Project, we work toward and look forward to a future Los Angeles in which cyclists, pedestrians, public transit users & automobiles all hold EQUAL value for infrastructure developers & lawmakers.",There will be no partners on the proposed projects. All elements of the project will be produced in-house.,"In the next year at ATP, we believe our running costs will add up to about $200,000. We raised nearly $100,000 this year (our organization's first fundraiser) through an online auction & believe that a combination of donations, corporate partnerships, and merchandise sales will fulfill any additional costs in the upcoming year.","$50,000- towards developing the ATP App TOT: $50,000

5102284,The Art of Skid Row: Bringing awareness to the homelessness state of emergency.,2015193,,,"The Art of Skid Row’s goal is to bring awareness to the homelessness state of emergency through digital and print photojournalism. The AoSR is an print and digital collaboration of local photographers that will be launched through a loud social media campaign and sold at Los Angeles businesses including: book stores, art galleries, restaurants, and coffee shops. Proceeds from book sales will achieve both an immediate and long-term solution for the homeless crisis.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Create,"Using the launch of The Art of Skid Row as a catalyst, Sustaynabl aims to be an equitable and responsible economic participant, contributing to the stabilization of Los Angeles’ unbalanced housing market. By orchestrating the impact of state and local government officials, city planning professionals, key real estate investors, and social non-government authorities, Sustaynabl poses the innovation to develop an immediate and long-term permanent solution to urban poverty. 
 
 In Los Angeles, for example, if one person makes $20,000/year and spends 50% of their gross income, $10,000 ($833/month) on rent, that person would have $10,000/year to participate in the rest of the economy. In a balanced housing market, that person should be paying 20-30% of their annual income in housing costs. Let’s say 25%, which is $5000 ($416 / month). That person then has $15000/year to participate more equitably in other sectors of the economy. By reversing the damaging impact of a renter’s burden in our current state of imbalanced housing costs, LA becomes an community in which one can pursue educational aspirations, have financial flexibility to support a family, and gain access to bare necessities they couldn’t once afford. 
 
 At Sustaynabl we believe a truly healthy economy is one where interdependence is established between all constituents. It is one where an unsettling juxtaposition between extreme poverty and extreme wealth no longer exist; where raising a family in Downtown Los Angeles is just as healthy as raising a family in Beverly Hills. Where quality education is no longer dictated by zip code.","Lack of political will and cross sector collaboration has been the greatest deterrent to ending homelessness. This will be our greatest roadblock as well. Sustaynabl will use The Art of Skid Row to overcome these challenges by generating revenue through for profit business models to accomplish what governments and an army of nonprofits have tried to for decades. 
 
 Gary Blasi, a UCLA professor and homelessness expert, said previous grand schemes to combat the homelessness issue have ""never made it off paper.” The $100m plan announced by Mayor Eric Garcetti may not be enough. The Art of Skid Row aims to tackle the challenge by bringing awareness to the severity of the issue in the public eye, and in doing so, generate revenue for short term solutions such as homeless services; and long term solutions like Urban Habitats.","We will evaluate our work through book sales, social media impressions, global awareness created, feedback and impact in the homeless community.

 Connecting Angelenos with bi-annual tours of Skid Row for those that desire to reach out to our homeless community members.","The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, Poverty Matters, United Way for a Greater Los Angeles, and countless other non profit organizations all attempt to address homelessness and provide services to those on the streets.
 
 In 2003, the City of Los Angeles launched a ten year plan to end homelessness, titled “Bring L.A. Home.” It was part of a larger national effort starting in 2000 to end homelessness, lead by National Alliance to End Homelessness and HUD. In 2002, hundreds of cities signed onto the pact.
 
 2015 marks the twelfth anniversary of Bring L.A. Home’s launching. No one needs to walk far to see that chronic homelessness still permeates practically every corner of Los Angeles. By LAHSA’s 2015 homeless count, homelessness in LA County has increased to 44,359, up from 39,463 in 2013. Evidently, an army of nonprofits funded by government grants has not been effective enough.
 
 Creating and signing onto a plan to end homelessness establishes a roadmap to end the sad state of affairs for tens of thousands of people. It shows ending homelessness is within society’s grasp. Actually implementing such a plan as scheduled is a different issue. Homelessness is a systemic result of an unbalanced housing market. Solving homelessness requires a balanced housing market. 
 
 Sustaynabl’s differentiation from competitors is its development of innovative projects that generate revenue to support the core mission - eliminating extreme urban poverty. Our efforts are aligned with the number one global goal of ending poverty by 2030. Incorporating a market-based solution, Sustaynabl will have a long-term impact on Urban Centers that has not yet been achieved by similar non-profit organizations solely reliant upon private donors and government grants.","The Weingart Center Association will receive an investment of 10% of the proceeds from each book.

Sustaynabl plans to publish and sell 45,000 print and electronic copies; this represents the amount of people currently living on Skid Row.
 By implementing an aggressive sales plan through targeted marketing and community engagement - Sustaynabl expects to generate over $1MM in proceeds during the first 12 months. 
 Immediate impact: Sustaynabl will invest 10% of revenue generated through book sales to Weingart’s comprehensive 9-month program that provides safe housing, meals, case management, job training, and job placement services to those experiencing homelessness. 
 Long term scalable plan, 90% of the revenue generated through book sales will be used to fund Sustaynabl’s major GIP, Urban Habitats (UH’s); mixed-use, mixed-income and environmentally friendly urban developments.
 Urban Habitats are designed to balance the housing market. UH’s will also reverse the cycle of “renter’s burden” in a city plagued with income disparity. This cycle of burden refers to the everyday renter that spends upwards of 50%+ of their income on housing, thereby reducing their capacity to purchase bare necessities (food, clothing, education). Sustaynabl seeks to develop its first UH in Los Angeles which will scale to other regions in the United States and eventually, around the globe. Urban Habitats will operate at optimal economic efficiency by dividing the residential units into three rental structures as follows:
 65%: Sustaynabl Units: Individuals and families pay an Occupancy Fee which is based on a Qualification Percentage (QP). The QP does not rise above 40%. The algorithm takes into consideration IRS income data, family / unit size, educational aspirations, and an individual's ability to earn income.
 25%: Market Linked Units: These units are linked to market pricing, but are priced lower than the subject property’s submarket to provide a competitive advantage and keep our units fully occupied at all times.
 10%: Transitional Units: These units have the ability to transition 120 - 240 at risk / homeless individuals into stable housing through our 6 month or 1 year comprehensive programs.
 By using various for-profit business models, Sustaynabl will provide a source of funding for responsible housing development and create the foundation of a balanced housing market."
5102219,The Center for Sustainable Communities in Compton CA,2018089,,,"Utilizing the model of ""What Makes Community?"" as our focus, NHS is working with the City of Compton, Pacific Coast Regional, and Metro CDC to create the first of several Centers for Sustainable Communities in South LA. The CSC will help low-to-middle income families in Compton deal with the impacts of divestiture by serving as a hub to provide access to housing, transit, employment, healthy living, and community food resources that make communities stronger and more resilient.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0Create0Live,"NHS' Center for Sustainable Communities will serve hundreds of low income families annually in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of blight. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic unemployment and underemployment, reduced capital access for small business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth disengagement. 
 
 In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities will provide the people of Compton and South Los Angeles County a facility that will serve as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decades. Specific impacts include 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living resources and medical clinic services to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents through the CSC Neighborhood Revitalization Institute; 4) Increasing access to business incubator services and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging youth (ages 5-24) in on-site green education and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our Financial Opportunity Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects on the property and in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Providing valuable community meeting space. In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.
 
 As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and homeowners through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, community development agencies, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven. By winter 2016 we expect to partner with the adjacent Los Angeles Conservation Corps Campus to magnify our regional impact, collaborate to attract a wide range of volunteers for our municipal water and green projects, and reach out to the educational community as the Compton Creek Project evolves.","Though we have adequate funds in hand to meet our initial costs for launching the Center, securing an ongoing source of sustainable funding and investment commitments to maintain the facility over the first five years of operation will be a challenge. Our primary focus over the first year of operation (Dec 2015 - Dec 2016) will include facilitating the necessary number of non-profit service and commercial tenants for the Center as well as continuing to leverage funds through the City of Compton, CDCs, regional financing partners, and community lending organizations to ensure viability through 2016 and beyond. 
 
 An additional challenge involves meeting the immediate needs of the community. Given that the community has endured an abandoned and neglected building since 1990, NHS feels obligated to open the facility and establish community services as soon as possible. Allocating staff to co-manage the Center will be a driving force behind staying on our planning schedule.","Gauging the success and impact of the project will require tracking data among partners and service providers that utilize the facility. NHS will work with partners to consolidate and filter impact data of those taking courses, attending classes, and receiving training. Affiliated groups working through the Center will be asked to share all relevant statistics and deliverables data with NHS. NHS will serve as the central filter for evaluating the impacts and status of job training, homeowner education, senior and afterschool programming, and small business education programs. 
 
 Specific annual benchmarks include:
 • Providing healthy living services and resources to 1,500 residents;
 • Assisting 1,200 families through the Financial Opportunity Center; 
 • Improving job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce by 20%;
 • Establishing 50 home and neighborhood gardens with youth workers; 
 • Increasing lending access for 50 small business owners.","There are dozens of organizations in Los Angeles County that focus on encouraging and promoting sustainability programs for a wide array of stakeholders (Global Green, Sustainable LA, etc). And there are a vast number of health and community support groups and programs that assist small businesses, schools, government agencies, and municipalities with transitioning to a more sustainable future. Some of these non-profits in the housing and neighborhood revitalization/community health field such as Habitat for Humanity and the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America operate in more specific areas of direct need such as stand-alone housing construction and exclusively foreclosure relief. There are smaller-scale community centers in surrounding cities that offer valuable neighborhood resources, but the Center for Sustainable Communities is truly unique in that it will serve as a diverse, multi-use 28,000 sq ft facility in South LA that will provide a broad range of critically needed specialized services, information, and access to resources that will make underserved and blighted neighborhoods in Compton and surrounding communities stronger and more resilient. 
 
 Specifically, the Center will include a set of features and services not found elsewhere in the region in a single location. These include a business incubator, health clinic services, fitness rooms, a Community Technology Center, free community meeting space, a Neighborhood Revitalization Institute, senior and afterschool programming, a free library, adult and youth job training, a Green Education & Conservation Center, a Healthy Living Cafe, non-profit and select commercial tenants, and organic urban gardens. With the exception of the Eco-Village in central Los Angeles, there isn't another property and partnership on the scale of what NHS is undertaking with the plan. With the first Center scheduled to open in Compton in December 2015, NHS will be exploring additional locations for new Centers in underserved communities and cities throughout Los Angeles County over the next decade.","NHS has entered into agreements with the City of Compton, Metro CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation as primary partners and is formalizing arrangements with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and Christian Health Centers to provide expertise, customized services, training opportunities, and cross-collaborative projects through the Center. The LA2050 award will be allocated to partners based on this formula: NHS - $40,000; each partner (4 total) - $15,000. 
 
 Each core partner brings unique experience and value:
 • City of Compton – Compton contributed bond funds to acquire the property and will facilitate project approvals, general public outreach, and program advocacy. 
 • METRO CDC – Providing neighborhood outreach, employment training, community engagement, community garden management, and referral services for youth and young adults. 
 • Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation – As a tenant, PCR offers financial, educational and consulting services to small business owners and start-ups. 
 • Los Angeles Conservation Corps – LACC will partner on environmental and urban reclamation projects in the Compton Creek watershed and surrounding area and will provide training, education, and mentoring for youth.
 • Christian Health Centers – Providing full service health clinic programs and services. 
 
 At least 50% of the tenants in the CSC facility will be service-driven. Critical factors for partnerships include: 1) a commitment to build sustainability in Compton/South Los Angeles County, 2) eliminating “silo organizing” on common regional issues, 3) diversity of services offered, and 4) history of delivering neighborhood revitalization programs in low income communities.","The Center will be funded by a mix of public/private community partner and major donor support. The total estimated cost of the acquisition and renovation of the facility is $7.3m. The property was purchased in 2014 for $2.6 million and we need to raise an additional $950,000 to meet our initial project projection. NHS has already entered into MOUs with several developers to finalize land bank, joint ventures, healthy schools initiative work, urban gardening and other community development strategic alignment agreements. The project is currently under construction. A key goal is to further target New Markets Tax Credits, local lender financing, faith-based institutions, foundation capital grants, and exploring as many community investment options as appropriate to leverage the project. 
 
 NHS will use CSC program activities and tenant rentals to help fund project costs and is securing additional foundation fundraising to cover financial gaps. Because of commitments from local foundations, federal agencies, and a handful of donors, we are in a good position to leverage partnerships with local banks, servicers, and the City of Compton to move forward together in our commitment to serve Compton/South Los Angeles County. LA2050 support will serve as a capstone award for the Center and will allow us to leverage additional funds to help NHS and its partners meet our launch date for the facility as we build on our vision to create sustainable economic and educational opportunities for the residents of Compton.","Revenue

For 30 years NHS has partnered with private and public investors, financial institutions, foundations, national non-profits, and cities to create and expand sustainable funding relationships to broaden access to capital. Based on our project funding projections and overwhelmingly positive response NHS has received from residents and partners, we believe there is sufficient support among community leaders, local businesses, service groups, and residents to both meet the resource needs of the Center and support the creation of new Centers in underserved communities."
5102070,The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching App,2016043,,,"The CoachArt Matching App will modernize the way chronically ill students are paired into arts and athletics mentorships and expand CoachArt’s transformative community to include exponentially more families. Our algorithmic matching app will reduce 99+% of the overhead currently needed to make a successful matches, from an average matching process of 8 hours down to approximately 5 minutes. In two years, that will scale annually to provide a projected 3,000 more students in Los Angeles.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"Los Angeles is booming. From the re-emergence of a thriving downtown to having the third largest technological ecosystem in the nation, Los Angeles is a force to be reckoned with. Residents continue to find innovative ways to connect to the community and expand their impact. That community importance has also been prevalent in the world of volunteerism in the city. About 21% of Angeleno residents volunteer -- giving 283.3 million hours of their time amounting to $6.4 billion of services contributed per year.
  
 CoachArt wants to revolutionize how volunteers are matched to individuals in need by creating an app to speed up the process. We’re a nonprofit that creates a transformative arts and athletics community for families impacted by childhood chronic illness. 
 
 In 2012, the University of Michigan reported that 15-18% of children nationwide were living with a chronic illness. Chronic illnesses disproportionately impact under-resourced communities with one in four children below the poverty line suffering from a chronic illness. 
 
 These startling numbers motivate the dedicated staff at CoachArt to improve the lives of these students by matching them with volunteers who share their interests. In 2014 alone, over 90% of our CoachArt students confirmed that CoachArt allowed them to express what they think and feel creatively. 
 
 Currently, CoachArt serves 1,300 students and their families in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, and are on pace to provide over 20,000 hours of free lessons to our participants by the end of 2015. Hundreds more students are on CoachArt’s waiting list as they work to recruit new volunteers to meet ever-growing student needs. We rely heavily on the dedicated program coordinators to make matches, which can take up to 8 hours per match. By implementing a matching app system, the process can be decreased significantly to only 5 minutes per match.
 
 The core insight is that the quality of potential matches can be algorithmically predicted in the same way technology predicts matches for employment, dating, and advertising; significantly reducing overhead. This will bring a nuance to the nonprofit sector and transform local matching programs.
 
 We anticipate an 8,800% increase once fully integrated at CoachArt. Moreover, our “moonshot” includes the creation of a replicable tool that will empower any current and future organizations with a matching model in their organization helping increase volunteerism rates in LA.","The biggest challenge for this project would be if families impacted by childhood chronic illness did not adopt the technology, particularly families from under-resourced communities that make up 80+% of our students. We’ve addressed that by creating an app instead of a website because of the higher prevalence of smartphones among our population compared to computers. Additionally, we believe the risk is diminishing, as over 90% of families from marginalized communities now have access to a smartphone and/or internet service. 
 
 The second biggest challenge is that the quality of our matches is reduced without the human matchmaking element. Most of the traditional matching process is a simple information problem, but it’s hard to quantify the intuitive value that is currently added. By changing to a high-tech solution, we seek to keep our high-touch relationship with our families. We’ll address this through feedback from matches, and periodically iterating on the algorithm.","CoachArt recently launched a new performance evaluation tool that measures the impact of our program activities on each student we serve across five key metrics: skills learned, sense of community, self-expression/self-empowerment, positive attitudes toward self/confidence, and health attitudes. We anticipate showing gains in all five measurements in nearly 100% of the students we serve. The CoachArt Student/Coach Matching Tool will pair approximately 30,000 additional students (an 8,800% increase) affected by chronic illness per year with adults who will engage them in an 8-hour arts or athletics mentorship. The health impacts of those mentorships will vary based on the disease and the activity. For instance, among cancer patients, 1 hour of art therapy causes statistically significant reductions in 8 out of 9 qualitative symptoms. As for athletics, 1 hour per day of sports reduces depression among youth by 8%.","Several organizations are tackling different aspects of childhood chronic illnesses. Entities like St. Jude Children’s Research hospital are seeking cures and performing medical treatment for children with chronic illnesses. Whereas Make-A-Wish, on a national level, and Casey Cares in the mid-Atlantic, are providing fun events for a similar population. Starbright World seeks to create an online community of forums for children affected by childhood chronic illness to share their experiences, thus sharing the goal to use technology to reach this population. 
 
 CoachArt is unaware, though, of any organization that is tackling the issue of pairing chronically ill children with coaches for an on-going and transformative arts and athletics experience, nor of an organization that serves the entire family and any siblings of children with chronic illnesses, nor of any organization that is seeking to do so by using technology to algorithmically replace the “matching” process.","CoachArt does not have any planned collaborations to pilot the matching app, but is fortunate to have a Board of Directors that is deeply rooted in the technology sector who will be an invaluable guide during this process. Our disruptive and entrepreneurial board makes CoachArt nearly uniquely positioned to transform match-based volunteerism.

Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital healthcare information in LA’s hospitals to assess the differences between cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Learn,"The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. 
 
 The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
 
 Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease early in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
 
 Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.","Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on their institution’s weaknesses. We hope to gain buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help them understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to proactively study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage their subordinates to participate. Assure them that all information is confidential and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or hospital group. We will give them the opportunity to do either a person-to-person survey or a text-based survey on their cell phones (to be developed) as well as the tool we have ready.","Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers, administrators, and compliance officers will provide the questionnaire data analysis we need. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare associations will help and we have already gained support from them for the initiative. Analysis will concentrate on finding the specifics of the gap between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between perceived and actual threats.","To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare cybersecurity perception risk analysis like this. It is highly possible that for-profit cybersecurity organizations and the military might be doing related assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is private and proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in the military, are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to address this issue holistically across the healthcare sector. We need a framework for best practices, and this has to come primarily from the private sector.","Dignity Health, Providence Partners for Health, Hospital Corporation of America , UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, University of Florida School of Medicine, The LA Healthcare Coalition of the LA County EMS Agency are non-paid collaborators.

COMMET will aggressively seek funding from other sources to fund the initiative beyond the first year. However, the first-year funding provided by LA2050 is essential to get the project started. Also, as an alternative, the data collected during the first year with LA2050 funding can still be extremely valuable even if it the number of respondents is lower than desired. In other words, the project would still be a success if follow-on funding were not secured.

Appropriately, SoCal was the birthplace for surfboard manufacturing and innovation. Sustainablesurf.org is currently working with leaders in the surf world towards better, safer, healthier practices - from shaping + design to glassing + storytelling. Working with Marko Foam, E-tech, and Entropy Resin, we will show how this transformative process works.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Looking also at Hawthorne, DTLA or near USC Campus.",ALL,"E3 Surf Craft's E-tech Glassing + surfboards (http://www.etechsurf.com) featuring co-founder Ryan Harris, is the first African American led, LA based eco minded surfboard making shop of its kind. As our prototype and ""innovation lab"" EcoBoard partner, we will work closely to create a workshop where individuals, companies, students, amateurs and pros, in and around the surfing community can see how innovation in materials and mindset, as related to surfboard building, can help transform an entire surf industry + culture. The EcoBoard Project promotes the adoption of non-toxic and low-carbon materials that leverage plant-based chemistry and recycled components, to produce a superior sustainably minded product resulting ultimately in a healthier workplace and ocean playground. 
 
 Having this popup Lab in LA, one of the most creative hubs in the world, enables us access to many of the thought leaders, industry veterans, educators, artists and media professionals for a robust collaboration and meeting of the minds. As the Pacific is at our front door, we will have multiple opportunities for EcoBoard demo's, education on plastic pollution, ocean acidification, storm runoff, and the overall need to keep our oceans healthy. We would do this in collaboration with local experts and organizations like Heal the Bay, Surfrider, the 5 Gyres, WaterKeeper and the Plastic Pollution Coalition. 
 
 We have several other programs and initiatives which tie-in nicely to the EcoBoard Project. ""Waste to Waves"" (http://wastetowaves.org), our styrofoam collection which turns discarded foam into board blanks with Marko Foam. ""What's in your Board"" (http://wiyb.sustainablesurf.org), shows the evolution of the surfboard and how it went from a green to a very toxic product through its manufacturing + design evolution. And ""Deep Blue Surfing"" Events (http://sustainablesurf.org/contests/), where we work closely with surf contest and event companies like Volcom, Vans and the World Surfing League reducing environmental impacts of a professional surfing contest. 
 
 Surfing begins with a surfboard, and it is our mission to transform the industry into better practices without sacrificing performance nor the bottom line. As the Surfers Poll recent ""Agents of Change"", we can already see a movement starting towards cleaner, more planet friendly materials. Our hope is this trend continues into all aspects of ocean related activities - where toxic materials and waste have been the norm.","One barrier we can foresee is finding a location partner to house our pop up workshop with an eventual longer term arrangement. The other challenge may be manpower, but we are hoping to cover that through internships and an eventual affiliation with schools like Otis or USC. We are also not opposed to having our workshop on a college campus for part of the year and integrating surfboard design and production into their curriculum. Our strategy is through like minded partnerships and those who see a positive impact through our work as something they can support. We have discussed the opportunity to set up shop within the already existing E-tech surfboard warehouse to show proof of concept if need be.","The EcoBoard Project includes an evaluation component that tracks the evolution of the market and the effectiveness of the program. Our work is also quantitatively evaluated through extensive list management of workshop attendees, consultations with manufacturers and shapers, surf professionals, along with classes and events. Boards purchased through the workshop and the yearly output of E-tech will be catalogued. Sustainablesurf.org is aligned with industry leaders, professionals and amateurs purchasing EcoBoards through affiliates like Lost Surfboards, Channel Islands, Firewire and others whose data can be anonymously included in aggregate in our yearly summary.","There are several other surf related, eco centric, organizations around the world like Surfrider, Waves for Water, Surfers for Change, Save the Waves, WILDCOAST, and 1% for the Planet. Most of these however are dedicated to protecting and preserving the coastal environment in a general sense. For example, Surfing for Change’s goal is to spread awareness, motivation, and promote action from surfers and non-surfers alike. 1% For the Planet aims to build and support an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating a healthy planet, (sustainablesurf.org is a recipient of monies from 1% for the Ecoboard Project via E-tech). They offer simple, tangible and proactive ways for the business community to be a part of the solution. 
 
 On the other hand, Sustainablesurf.org through the EcoBoard Program explores the new emerging world of eco friendly board production, featuring a real world product with a very tangible solution for better practices in surfboard manufacturing through tactile examples you can actually hold in your hand and ride. Through our efforts, we can accelerate awareness and ultimately demand and production of sustainable surfboards, spurring additional innovation in new technology and design. Tactically, we achieve this by creating science-based measurable quantitative standards for sustainable surfboard materials, a bio-content labeling campaign based on industry best practices, and an EcoBoard education campaign for both surfers and industry. 
 
 For society, the sustainable surfboard revolution represents a high-profile media friendly and engaging story of sustainable design innovation. This workshop + lab becomes a “story-telling platform” that can galvanize all members of the general population: male, female, kids, young adults, middle-aged and even more mature adults. Research shows that surfing is the number one aspirational sport in America that youth (aged 14-25) most want to learn (Label Networks 2012). Simply put, surfing is a lifestyle that is highly attractive and often emulated. It is the perfect vehicle to promote a sustainable lifestyle that is “cool” and desirable; the EcoBoard becomes the catalyst and starting point for that conversation.","E-tech Surfboards for design, shaping, glassing and training. They will essentially lead the workshops along with the guidance of sustainablesurf.org. Marko Foam will provide the recycled blanks for surfboard design and shaping. Bio Epoxy Resin innovators, Entropy Resin will provide the ""super sap"" for the green glassing portion of the workshops. Sustainable surf.org will provide a more fully detailed breakdown on the proposed budget, however please note there will be an offset due to a balance between materials purchased and used at a wholesale cost that can be repaid through sales of workshop made boards and demo's. We are looking at a more sustainable model so the 100k is used more as a launch pad for the workshop and not for operating costs. Sustainable Surf will oversee the social media, calendar of events and management of the space.","We believe the $100K award will allow us to build a modular pop up workshop, lab, exhibition space that best represents the overall workings of the EcoBoard Project as outlined in this proposal. Being modular in nature, this will allow for greater flexibility for setting up and taking down at intended partner locations when determined. Since the EcoBoard Project is already in production, this adjunct location, exhibition space and workshop will act as a showroom site to better promote the ongoing program - additional costs will be covered by continuing sales, workshop fees, corporate underwriting and merchandise sales.","Ecoboard Pop-Up Workshop + Education Lab

Edible gardens provide organic produce, a sense of community, beauty, increase property values and provide an emotional and psychological benefits. Touching the soil has tangible benefits, as does being a part of a community and the building of a garden which creates a sense of hope and optimism for the future.
 
 While community gardens are a great model, not all LA residents have access to these kinds of properties, either because of proximity or expense. The two most prohibitive reasons why people don't grow their own food are: 1. Access to land. 2. How to do it.
 
 I will make LA the healthiest place to live by installing 15 new ""Edible Apartments"" around our City of Angeles. I have already piloted and proven the process here at my own apartment building in Mid-City Los Angeles.
 
 The Edible Apartment has transformed the quality of life for residents, created a sense of community, improved the property value and imbued a sense of curiosity and presence for the surrounding community.
 
 How do I know this? Because I have experienced it and documented it first hand. Strangers have knocked on my door to tell me that the garden has inspired them and made them go home and plant some tomatoes. I have met people outside of Los Angeles and told them about my project only to hear them say, ""Oh my goodness, that's YOUR project?...I saw it on the way to LACMA when I was visiting LA - it's amazing!!"" 
 
 We are holding classes here, community gatherings, informal TEA parties and garden tours. People are inspired, curious and want to learn how to do it for themselves. I've received national and international letters from people asking if I'd travel to help them at their own apartment building to create a similar project, or, at the very least, do videos on how they can do it themselves.
 
 The Edible Apartment was dead grass just four months ago. Now it is a thriving organic oasis right in the middle of apartment buildings and offices. It's the definition of health in a myriad of ways.
 
 As with so many other areas, Los Angeles will be an model to other cities around the world for what is possible in terms of creative and pro-active ways to take charge of our health, environment, community and sense of place, 'even for' those who don't own their own homes.","One challenge will be maintenance, which will be overcome with the implementation of a Green Team.","I have already evaluated my work with my pilot project here in Mid-City Los Angeles. It is thriving and the residents, community and apartment building owner are all thrilled with the outcome. They are calling me the Mensch of Miracle Mile (that means good person).

 The garden will serve as a center of healing for those navigating grief, where individuals of all ages can get their hands dirty with others walking the same paths, discovering over shared meals and shared experience that they are not alone.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0CreatePlayLive,"The same places where we see food instability are the same places where we see disproportionate loss. Fifty percent of inner-city kids will experience the sudden loss of a family member before they're 21. We cannot talk about poverty, race, systems-failure, or opportunity without talking about grief. If we’re to build resilient communities, and to solve the problems we need to solve in LA, we need to start by building authentic relationships between the people who make up this city. That starts by choosing to share the things we typically avoid, beginning with loss and grief.
 
 HOW: 
 - GROW: During the building phase, we will work with LA-based Hope After Project to design and custom-build four community service memorials. These memorials will invite those who have experienced grief to volunteer in memory of their loved ones. Teams may work on everything from painting the mural, to planting the garden, to building benches. The end result will not only be a thriving garden, but a series of living memorials within it: each a tribute to an extraordinary life lost. Moreover, building on LA’s thriving street art scene, we’ll commission a collaborative mural to honor and celebrate the ways in which the legacies of the dead endure through the living, and invite the public to join us in painting it. 
 - HARVEST: During a one-month span of the harvest season, we will bring together Angelenos of varying ages, creeds, and cultural and economic backgrounds for a dinner series and a chance to share in the foods of the garden, and to talk openly about our experiences of grief and loss and what it means to live well after. We'll invite dinner guests--chefs, storytellers, students & teachers, doctors & patients, police officers & those they serve--to learn about the stories beneath the stereotypes, about their respective roads traveled, and the losses and setbacks and sources of resilience that have made them who they are. 
 - SPREAD: We’ll film the series & share it as an episode on The Kitchen Widow, & develop a downloadable toolkit for others looking to create their own Grief Gardens. The toolkit will include everything from the science of food rituals & grief, to community gardening 101, to tips/suggested conversation-starters for facilitating a conversation about loss & life after over a meal. Finally, we’ll use the conversation series to create several accompanying toolkits, such as exercises & tips for parents/educators to talk to kids about grief and loss.","The biggest challenge is securing a site for the garden. We are currently in exploratory conversations with the Library Foundation of LA, building on the role of LA's libraries as curators of conversations that matter and as one of the few remaining gathering places that reflect the unique makeup of the communities of which they are a part. However, we are exploring various options, including schools situated in a neighborhood where both food insecurity and chronic loss are endemic, or in a public park or similar location. We are aiming for a space that can house a medium-sized garden, capable of holding at least six-ten raised beds, and a farm table available for use via sign-up by families, community groups and individuals looking for a chance to share a meal together. 
 
 A part-time gardener, together with a team of volunteers, will ensure that the garden is well-tended and welcoming throughout the year.","We will measure our success on three levels: 
 - Direct engagement, as measured through number of volunteers, number of visitors and frequency of use by members of the local community (with a focus on those with limited access to healthy food), number of meals served, and diversity among participants. 
 - Cultural reach, as measured by number and reach of press hits and social media shares, number of toolkit downloads, etc. 
 - Self-perception & perception of others: Through surveys & facilitated reflections with dinner guests/visitors throughout the year, we will examine the garden’s impact on participants’ feelings of physical and emotional well-being, mindset and feelings of agency, and empathy toward others both within and outside their own schools and communities. 
 
 We aim to realize a day in which those who have experienced trauma and loss are recognized not as objects of pity, but as better listeners and better leaders, characterized by profound empathy, resilience & agency.","When it comes to tackling food insecurity, there’s no such thing as competition: We’re all in this together. Our ability to build authentic community and to elevate a broader cultural change depends on our ability to secure a wide array of partners, and working hand-in-hand with existing community gardening programs and other grassroots organizations working in LA’s high-poverty neighborhoods.
 
 Already, school and community gardens are increasingly commonplace, thanks in large part to organizations like LA Green Grounds, Enrich LA, The LA Community Garden Center, The Kitchen Community, Pacoima Beautiful, The Collaborative Eagle Rock Beautiful, Occidental College's FEAST Organic Garden and Edible Schoolyard. Efforts like Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign have highlighted the need for fresh fruit and vegetables in public school lunches, and recognized school gardening programs as a tool to fight childhood obesity. 
 
 Less common are memorial gardens: Spaces designed so that grieving individuals and families can gather to remember loved ones, and for a few hours, focus their attention on growing new things. To our knowledge, no such community garden exists in LA. What’s more, few of these efforts make the conversations around the table, and the connections, empathy, and healing gained there, the explicit focal point of the garden. 
 
 The Good Grief Garden will be unique in doing all three: Addressing and raising awareness of food insecurity in high-poverty areas, creating an accessible and rejuvenating space for healing after loss--particularly among those subject to chronic trauma--and using the dinner table to create a unique bridge-builder across demographic lines.","This project is a joint collaboration between The Dinner Party and The Kitchen Widow.

And, often, they are the sole caregivers for their young children. By providing a continuum of care, including residential substance abuse treatment and outpatient services to this target population, the program transforms not only the lives of women but the health and wellness of their children as well. 
 
 As Los Angeles County struggles with overcrowding prisons with subpar services for those with mental illness and substance abuse, the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program is an already implemented and proven program for successfully helping families. Women with histories of substance abuse are more likely to cycle in and out of jail. Their children are more then likely to end up unstable living situations or foster care. By diverting women to this program, Prototypes reunites women and their children so they can both receive integrated care, including primary and mental health care. Children also get to rebuild the bond with their mothers in a safe and structured environment so they can grow and thrive. 
 
 In addition to comprehensive care for addiction, mental illness and any other medical concerns, the program provides wraparound services to help women gain vital vocational skills, complete their GED, and find employment. Case managers also help women with basic life skills to create a safe and healthy household for their families and help women find permanent housing. Employment and housing are critical components in helping women remain successful in their recovery. These comprehensive services also support a mother’s ability to create a safe, stable and healthy household for her children. 
 
 By addressing the underlying issues that led women to the criminal justice system in the first place, WRC empowers women to become independent and healthy members of the Los Angeles community. WRC also includes entire families and connects them with extensive services designed to increase a family’s self-sufficiency.","Policy at the state and local level could have a drastic impact on this program. Public Safety Realignment (AB 109) continues to present challenges by shifting how people are classified, from Parole to Probation, which has an impact on eligibility for funding for this program. Currently, there is no dedicated funding source for the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Court program. Instead, Prototypes uses existing funding streams to ensure access to care. Even so, Proposition 47 reduces penalties for drug possession and other nonviolent crimes so that many are able to reduce their convictions from felonies to misdemeanors. When treatment is voluntary (like under Prop 47), it can be more challenging to recruit and retain clients in treatment, even though those who graduate have a high success rate. Prototypes monitors LA County and California’s policy activities and advocates for the investment in community reentry and diversion programs for this women in the criminal justice system.","Prototypes and its partners track outcomes including improved mental health, reduced drug use, increased employment and housing, and reduced recidivism. Recently, the LA County Department of Public Health conducted a Health Impact Study that found multiple health and public safety benefits. Some of the major findings from the report include: graduates from WRC have a lower chance of rearrests, re-convictions and returns to custody compared to the California state prison population; and, compared to their employment status before entering the WRC, graduates experienced more than a 10-fold increase in employment after completing the WRC program and WRC graduates experienced a 54% decrease in homelessness after program completion. Prototypes is currently implementing an Electronic Health Record System that will better data collection. With enhanced services under this new project, Prototypes will monitor client access and outcomes with additional mental health services.","No, this diversion program is the only one of its kind for women in Los Angele County, perhaps in the country. It utilizes an unprecedented collaboration among public agencies to identify, engage, and monitor women who have cycled in out of prison for most of their lives. There are similar drug court programs but WRC is unique because it serves women with criminal records who are facing felony offenses, including women facing more serious offenses. Because of the collaborative approach, the Public Defender and District Attorney work closely together to identify women who would be eligible for the program, often making exceptions so that women with some of the most challenging histories are offered this program. Started as a pilot program in 2007, the members of this collaboration agreed early on that there would not be cherry picking of clients. Rather, the program was designed and implemented to accept women with co-occurring disorders, significant histories of trauma, and lengthy histories of involvement with the criminal justice system. In fact, the average woman accepted into the program has spent two-thirds or more of her life incarcerated without having received any treatment. Finally, this program is unique in that it reunites women with their children in the early stages of their treatment.","WRC is based on collaboration between District Attorney’s Office, Public Defender’s Office, Department of Probation, LAC Superior Court, California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, County Criminal Justice Coordination Committee and the Department of Public Health’s Substance Abuse and Prevention Control Program. Each entity uses its own resources to support WRC. The LA2050 grant will be used to enhance mental health services for women and their children at Prototypes.","The enhanced mental health and psychiatry services for WRC will cost $100,000 which the LA 2050 grant will would cover. Prototypes will be able to continue the enhanced services beyond this grant by accessing additional funding that will come available under the Affordable Care Act. The other program costs for WRC are covered through the public contracts that Prototypes has in place to serve this population. Through awareness and continued evaluation, the aim is for leaders in the community to realized the true benefits of WRC and create dedicated funding streams to serve more women in the criminal justice system.","Prototypes

The LA 2050 grant will fund comprehensive and evidence-based mental health treatment as well as psychiatric assessment and services to better meet the mental health needs of the target population. This includes individual, group and family therapy that incorporates evidence-based practices including: Seeking Safety which assists women with trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder by seeking help from supportive peers, accessing community resources, increasing participation in disease prevention/health promotion, practicing honesty and increasing self-care; Motivational Enhancement Therapy in which staff develop a partnership with the women to better match the level of care to her readiness for change and to resolve ambivalence to change; and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help develop positive beliefs and attitudes by helping women to identify with peers, receive support and practice new behaviors. By more effectively improving women’s mental health, Prototypes can increase the likelihood of a woman’s successful recovery once they leave the program. This will further increase the outcomes for women and demonstrate the overall effectiveness of WRC. Reducing mental health barriers, along with advocating for treatment for formerly incarcerated women among elected officials, will provide Prototypes the leverage to scale the Second Chance Women’s Reentry Program."

5102195,The Los Angeles Service Academy,2018077,,,"We seek philanthropic support to fund LASA's ongoing operations and next cohort of student participants in the 2016-2017 programmatic year. Specifically, LASA brings together high school juniors from all over Los Angeles County for an intensive week in the summer, plus one Saturday per month during the school year. Each meeting combines experts with field trips tied to themes critical to civic life in LA: transit, governance, water, the LA River, the harbor, law enforcement, food/housing, etc.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,,ALL,"LASA BEGINS WITH QUESTIONS. 
 
 How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such agencies funded? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles? What about businesses and non-profits? What are the potential career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin? These are among the thousands of questions that students have about the city and region in which they live. There are a million more that they would have if they knew more about place, region, and history.
 
 LASA participants (all high school juniors) will gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies – infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise – of the region in which they live, and will build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers they connect with over the course of a year. Over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of change, community building, and connection throughout Los Angeles.
 
 For example, a perennial LASA theme is water: where does it come from? Who buys and sells it? How is it delivered to cities, regions, neighborhoods, homes? In answering these questions, LASA's students meet with officials from agencies such as MWD and DWP and then visit water treatment and delivery facilities to see firsthand the complex processes at work in watering such a vast region.
 
 Garnering such knowledge will allow the students to become more civic minded and engaged with a critical aspect of life in the Los Angeles Basin. Over the year, LASA grapples with other issues equally important to the future of the region and to every Southern California resident. These include investigations of law enforcement and police oversight, business and entrepreneurialism, sports and entertainment, technology, governance and electoral politics, the harbor and the basin's rivers, food security, housing access, museums and cultural institutions.
 
 In studying these issues, young people from across the entire basin will connect with one another and gain confidence in their roles as agents of change.","As we move into year five of our project, we recognize even more clearly that LASA works best when it reaches across the entire basin and when its student cohorts are reflective of the diversity of the region in all metrics. Sustaining that breadth is a challenge, and we address it by way of rigorous outreach and face-to-face recruitment of young people. Simultaneously, we work hard to develop and nurture LASA's relationships with a network of teachers, counselors, and school administrators who assist us in identifying young people who can become part of the program.","We approach evaluation in two ways. One, we monitor the program by way of annual evaluations from participants. This process is a way of seeking ongoing feedback in order to make regular, modest adjustments to the program. 
 
 Second, and more important, we have always maintained that the best measure of LASA's effectiveness will be evident in years ahead. As our students graduate from high school, move on to college (which we track), and return to Los Angeles to begin careers, we believe that their time with LASA will enable them to become effective agents of change. As they become increasingly engaged in civic life, our hope is that they will draw upon productive connections to one another, connections initially fostered when they were sixteen years old.","To our knowledge, there is no such program aimed at the region's young people. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, in its non-profit capacity, sponsors Leadership LA. This is a program with LASA-like structure and aims, but it is entirely reserved for mid-career professionals (who pay to participate).
 
 LASA is offered at no cost to all participants.","LASA's two institutional partners -- The Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library -- offer in-kind support to the program (primarily meeting spaces). If successful with LA2050, LASA will utilize the entirety of the $100,000 grant for programmatic use in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.","LASA currently operates on an $85,000 budget annually. LA2050 funds would be utilized at $50,000 for 2016-2017 and the same for the following year.
 
 With LA2050 support, we feel confident that the additional $35,000 per year could be raised from other philanthropic sources -- several of which have indicated a willingness to help with such shortfalls if LA2050 funds are provided.","$80,000 total:

We would like to increase the size of a given class to between 40 and 50 students per year. More than that on an annual basis would inhibit the connections and lines of engagement fostered throughout the year. However, we would like to continue to grow the program beyond the aggregation of ""students served."" We are considering programmatic ""wings"" to LASA's central, student-participant model, but we have made no firm decisions in this regard as yet."

One-in-a-half out of every 100 students have actually attempted it and nearly half of those never told anyone. Ninety percent of people who have committed suicide were depressed and withdrawn, and love loss is one of the leading causes of depression and isolation. 
 
 Our organization is committed to suicide prevention by providing connection through the power of storytelling. Our multimedia production company, The Love Story Media, Inc. produces content and publishes quarterly documentary journals. 
 
 These digital and printed ""documentary journals"" is a collection of journal entries from our writers' interview experiences and the videos covering interviews. Most importantly, the documentary journals provide blank pages for customers to journal their experiences of letting go so they may discover their own experiences and find the courage to reach out and share.
 
 The documentary journal is produced for people who have loved and lost, of people who have loved and lost, by people who have loved and lost. Since college students are one of the highest young adults at risk after a love loss, our digital and print copies will be distributed among colleges bookstores throughout Los Angeles. Thirty-three percent of those proceeds will fund the workshops of our non-profit arm, The Love Story, Inc.
 
 Our non-profit arm, The Love Story, will provide online and in-person workshops. By emphasizing our values on courage, compassion and contribution, we encourage our students to learn the craft of story, apply it as a personal catharsis, and publish their work to our community as a contribution. 
 
 Once our Angelinos will start writing in The Love Story journals, we will invite them to engage their experiences with others on our online community by sharing parts of their journal entries and viewing other submissions. They also have the opportunity to workshop their journal entries through our online and in-person workshops that sharpens their writing craft. Ten percent of the profits from our curriculum and workshops will also provide scholarships to those in need.","One challenge that we will face would be finding instructors who have a dual background in storytelling and in mental health. However, doing preliminary searches, we have already found quite a few who are passionate and qualified to integrate the craft of storytelling with the art of letting go. 
 
 Another challenge would be to maintain the integrity, privacy and anonymity of those who share their story of love and loss through our website, keeping it troll- and bully-free. To prevent this, we will create a membership login system where we can track our users and clearly outline our anti-bully and anti-trolling policy. We reserve the right to exclude anybody who violates this policy. We have a no tolerance policy and set high standards to ensure a safe, understanding, and healthy environment for people to process their loss and share themselves without judgement.","We will measure the success of our educational impact by the number of online and live workshop registrations. 
 
 We will measure the success of the social impact from our stories by our online metrics such as mailing lists, unique monthly visitors on Google Analytics, and open, click-through, bounce and retention rates. 
 
 We will measure the success of social connection based on our digital and printed documentary journal sales, the number of production applications, and the number journal entries submitted by our customers. We will also measure connection through social shares, likes, comments, and followers on Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter.","Our first type of competitors are local writing workshops like Writing Workshops LA and LA Writer's Group who cater to clients interested in publishing novels, short stories and poems. Other similar competitors are colleges that provide courses on similar crafts. The Love Story’s curriculum hybridizes the craft of writing, photography, and filmmaking with the art of letting go. 
 
 Another type of competitor would be other non-profit organizations like the Trevor Project and college counselors who offer intervention in the areas of depression and suicide. People who go through these programs have the context of being the “patient” or “sufferer” who needs “help” and through our organization, people have the context of being the “student” or “storyteller,” who serves as a contributing voice to our community.

We will look for outside grants to expand the program to documentary filmmaking and photojournalism. Our goal is to reach 1,000 registrations within the first year. 
 
 The second third of the grant will be to expand the production by investing in equipment and hire professional writing and film editors who oversee and guide the students who produce the content. We also want to invest in the producer will will scout for artists willing to get interviewed and matching it with the right student producer.

Our organization is doing its part by providing business and entrepreneurial training to residents of homeless shelters throughout Los Angeles. While our clients are getting excellent business training and are even partnered with a team graduate students who volunteer to help them with their business ideas, our clients still lack basic resources needed to actually launch and run their businesses. Many of our clients have struggled with homelessness, addictions and have been incarcerated for many years. For some entrepreneurship is their only option for income. Last summer we were able to secure a small facility for a few of our clients and successfully launched 4 new businesses. However the space could only hold 4 businesses and was also restrictive on the types of businesses permitted to use the space. We have 14 new clients currently going through our training program that will need access to space to launch their businesses in a few months. This funding will allow us to secure a larger facility to help more of our clients launch, grow and operate their small businesses.","One major challenge we face is dealing with the variety of businesses our clients propose. We have some clients starting food businesses, some starting craft businesses, some starting welding and/or furniture businesses. Our challenge/solution is to find a facility that we can renovate to create separate work areas for each category of business. For instance, we would like to create a commercial kitchen in part of the space, have an industrial section and an offices section, a warehouse section and a store front. If we are unable to secure such a location we will have to rent two separate locations (hopefully next to each other) to accomplish the same goal.","The most obvious performance indicator for us is the number of businesses that are able to launch as well as the amount of revenue the various businesses generate. We are also looking at how many of our clients are able to move out of the shelters and into permanent housing. Additionally there are qualitative items that are relevant to our work, such as increased quality of life as well as the pride/self confidence that goes along with entrepreneurship - especially for those coming from a background of homelessness, poverty, domestic violence and substance abuse.","Yes, there are other organizations doing similar work; the SBA, SCORE, etc. However, we are unique in at least three distinct ways. First we are working with a target demographic that most other organizations do not work with. Secondly, each of our clients are put on a team of 2-3 graduate students who volunteer as business mentors for our clients and help the develop their business ideas and business plans. Finally we are providing funding (micro-loans) and other resources for our clients allowing them to overcome a major barrier in entrepreneurship.","We have several partner organizations that we work with. First off we work with homeless shelters including URM, Hope Gardens, PATH, Upward Bound House, 4 different Salvation Army Shelters, Chrysalis, San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission, DWC. Additionally we work with Pepperdine University who supplies student volunteers/business mentors. However, the $100k will be used to secure work space and equipment for our clients and access to micro-loans for working capital. Our partner organizations will not need to access these funds.",We have budgeted $100k for 1 year. See projections below,A 1 year lease in the valley for the size of facility we are looking at is $4k per month - roughly $50k for the year. We will utilize $30k to renovate the facility and to purchase equipment. The remaining $20k will be used to provide micro-loans for our clients. On average our clients need $2k to start their businesses. This means we will be able to provide loans for at least 10 clients,"We have already had several organizations approach us in the past from Orange County, Arizona, Seattle and others. However, we have been very hesitant to pursue these options as we want to first prove our concept. Up until this last summer our program has been strictly and educational program. However as mentioned, this last summer we were able to secure a small facility to prove our concept - ""homeless people can indeed start businesses."" - though our success has been small so far.

The city has inspired a new generation of artists to migrate there for production and ideas. 
 
 The Moving Museum Los Angeles is offering this opportunity in bringing an influential group of international and local artists and collectives together in an intervention that will encourage social interaction and participation, empower communities, and activate a new chapter of development for LA as the most significant and accessible place to create. 
 
 Participating artists will receive a budget towards producing their commissioned work and will be supported in the professional development of their practice throughout an intensive residency period involving in-depth dialogue around research, conceptualization and production of their work. 
 
 The residency component and inclusion of artists with a social practice are an important catalyst to form a lasting dialogue between these diverse and currently fragmented voices across the globe at an important moment for LA’s position within a shifting international context. 
 
 We will run a public and educational program geared towards engaging the artists within local schools and universities and offering students across all ages to learn from established contemporary artists. The Moving Museum will a develop Curatorial Fellowship program as part of the LA project to offer recent graduates a rare opportunity to gain valuable first-hand professional experience with artists production, curators, exhibition production, running a residency.
 
 We will find diverse ways of including artist within the project as producers, collaborators and advisors. The Moving Museum will deliver an intensive public program, initiated by the participating artists and in collaboration with local institutions and non-profit spaces, which aims to engage local audiences and offer a point of access to art and artists that is more direct and less didactic, focusing on Food, Performance, Workshops, and Performative lectures. The program will also be made accessible for international audiences through an online platform.","While LA has a burgeoning art scene, the scale of it geographically is such that creative communities are spread out and often remain within their own districts. One of the biggest challenges will be ensuring that we reach and engage with the multitude of LA communities in a meaningful way that aligns with their cultural interests and vision for the city. We aim to activate projects citywide, housing artists in different areas and engaging local and international audiences from various communities and backgrounds. 
 
 The Public Program will serve as the backbone to the residency as an active interface, a more organic, less institutional meeting ground for interested publics. We will invite a local curator to lead the Public Program and will collaborate with local institutions and non-profit spaces. We will host events, focused around a culinary or performative gesture held in different venues spread throughout LA.","We hope to create meaningful and socially engaged projects that have a lasting impact on the communities affected. We will track the development of those participating in the project, the number of Fellows who have been offered employment or developed their own projects, the quantity and success of future LA projects from our partners, the art spaces and projects formed across the city. The commissioned artworks will be measured on how they materialized during the residency and exhibition period, and the impact they have made. We will follow international artists on-going relationship with LA, whether through production of artwork, museum or institutional interest, or continued talks or events with the artists.
 
 Our aim is to create a dynamic events program that engages local and international audiences and successfully bridges the gap between disparate communities. We will collect data on audience numbers and the types of communities represented, on the ground and online.","There are currently only a small number of international artists residency programs active in LA and this project will aim to mark one of the largest, coordinated influxes of international resident artists in LA’s recent history.
 
 There is a need for a cultural and educational program that actively nurtures the development of new work and ideas in a more progressive and impactful way, both in supporting the professional development of local and international arts practitioners and to re-imagine the transferal of cultural information through a less institutional context. As a result, The Moving Museum Los Angeles will provide a catalyst to activate a new chapter of development within the Los Angeles creative community. 
 
 The Moving Museum identifies a real and pressing opportunity to encourage collaborations between industries, cultures and voices, and to connect the culturally disparate social and ethnic communities across LA by exchanging ideas from leading artistic voices around the world. The intensive public program aims to engage artists with local audiences more directly through social and performance based activities.
 
 As the role of the artist and arts practitioner shifts within the changing institutional landscape, so do the requirements, experience and skills. The Moving Museum has identified areas that are vital for this development and offers the type of stimulating environment, which is fundamental to deliver rich and diverse work. 
 
 The Moving Museum aims for its activities to be sustainable and beneficial to artists and the communities in which they take place - offering a lasting, daring, and unparalleled international platform for artists and new ideas.
 
 The Moving Museum is a catalyst for thought around the changing spaces of art production. Through artist residencies, commissions, partnerships with local institutions, publications, educational and public programming, The Moving Museum is committed to supporting and presenting innovative research and discourse wherever we go.","The 40 participating artists will all be commissioned to develop new projects alongside the residency as a means to articulate their practice within an exhibition that marks an important moment for Los Angeles’s position within a shifting international context. Each artist will be provided a stipend towards the production of their work. This stipend, for the most part will be used on manufactures and other practitioners within Los Angeles to support the production of the artists work. Thus, indirectly these funds will also be reinvested into other industries within the LA community. 
 
 The Moving Museum will provide a Curatorial Fellowship as part of the program to offer recent graduates an opportunity to work closely with the Directors to oversee various aspects of the project including artwork production, exhibition production, running a residency. This type of engagement within the contemporary art field is not one that can be taught through art colleges or traditional education. There are few opportunities to gain such first hand and expansive experience. 
 
 We will work with local designers on aspects of our marketing campaign including publication and brand development. We will engage with local writers to develop the publication text and anthologies for the online journal. We will work with craftsmen and practitioners across different industries to help with the exhibition production, with local film makers and photographers on the documentation of the project.
 
 We will partner with local arts organizations and non-profit spaces to facilitate and host the residencies and public program.","Though the overall budget we are aiming to raise for the project in its entirety is $450,000, this $100,000 backed by the LA2050 Grant Challenge would play an integral part in realizing this project happen.
 
 We have a founding partner, The Vinyl Factory, who share our vision for creating unique experiences around the world and contribute to percentage of our operating budget. We are continuing collaborations with the foundations, cultural partners, government organizations, embassies and individual patrons whom we have worked with in the past that will support their local artists. We have tentative confirmation of all of their support upon submission of artists proposals. We are also growing a network of partners and supporters within Los Angeles to support at various levels as well as providing in-kind support, which will reduce the overall budget. The Moving Museum is also allocating a percentage of its funding that was raised through its previous exhibition to support the early stages of The Moving Museum LA.","The $100,000 budget will go towards the residency program, artist production costs, professional development opportunities and documentation costs. We have allocated the actual costs below and how much of that we would contribute from the total $100,000.

 The overall budget is $450,000 which includes all the exhibition production, logistics, visas, administration, PR and Marketing etc. We will fundraise the other amounts however the above is how we would allocate the funds received from LA2050.","The Moving Museum aims to make long-term impressions through temporary interventions, with an experimental format that responds in a unique way to each local context.
  
 Although Los Angeles has a wealth of artists and enterprising start-ups, the city is populated with culturally disparate social and ethnic islands and the current arts activities tend to be independently produced. As the city enters the 21st century, there is a real and pressing opportunity to connect these local communities with each other within an international context to encourage collaborations between these pockets of the city, with other industries, cultures and voices and exchange ideas from leading artistic voices around the world.
 
 The Moving Museum will continue to advocate for Los Angeles as a visionary city at the forefront of artistic ingenuity and will draw on this newly positioned global arts hub, to cultivate and re-define the contemporary art landscape.
 
 Following the residency, public program and exhibition period we would hope that a number of the discussions, commissioned works and other projects initiated would continue to develop and be taken on by future partners, collaborators and the local community. Inspiring a new generation of residency models, artist networks and spaces to take the lead, we would see outside industries attracted by the scope to collaborate and drive their presence through artistic innovation and ideas.
 
 We would develop our online platform to provide an opportunity for continuing the development of digital and interactive works as well as host webcast talks built from topics addressed during the project to extend on LA’s influence with an online audience as an increasingly important arena for the arts.
 
 Ultimately, the success of this project would be used as a model example of how to transform artistic communities in other cities that desperately require a program of this nature to survive, evolve and become part of the global dialogue."
5102198,The OCEAN is the best place to play in LA! But we must keep her clean!,2015131,,,"At least once a month, we go to various shipwrecks and reefs that are covered in ghost nets, which will wreak havoc on fragile marine ecosystems for decades or even centuries if they are not removed. Los Angeles is FULL of people who scuba dive, surf, swim, snorkel, kayak, windsurf, etc.- we live near the ocean because we LOVE her! We also do a lot of outreach for adults and kids of all ages: lectures, presentations, tabling events to let everyone know what is happening in the ocean.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,"ANY school that will let us do a presentation, we will attend. For ocean cleanups: we are working mostly in the San Pedro Bay and off of Catalina.",Learn,"This is a project that is already underway, but we need funding in order to sustain it. People move to California to be near the ocean, this is a precious resource that affects many lives. Abandoned commercial fishing nets pose multiple threats- not only to the underwater world, but for the people enjoying the ocean. Abandoned nets create navigational hazards to boaters, they damage fish stocks, they cause death and destruction which directly impacts the enjoyment of scuba divers and other people who come to the ocean to play.","Our biggest barrier is funding. Strategies for overcoming this obstacle includes maintaining efforts to solicit donations/ grants, and to generate interest in our project. Invariably, every time we are invited to do a presentation, so many people approach us afterwards and say, ""I had no idea this was happening!"" Ghost fishing is a HUGE problem- and in Los Angeles, it is literally in our backyards! We also invite non-divers to come on our cleanup missions, so that they can see first-hand what we are doing to help the ocean. This has also received a very consistently positive response.","We have been keeping track of every single cleanup and every single outreach event, to approximate our impact on the community and of course on the ocean. I have an ongoing spread sheet on my computer that I keep ""public,"" it is available to anyone who wishes to see it. Regarding the ocean, it is fascinating to see the transformation of a killing field to a healthy, vibrant reef once the ghost nets are removed. Documenting every single cleanup dive with video and/or still photography is another way that we keep track of our progress and evaluate our impact.","What is unique about our project is that all of our volunteers have been trained in the exact same manner, which codifies the approach and makes it not only safer but more effective. There are other organizations that do ocean cleanups, but ""Ghost Fishing"" uses Global Underwater Explorer trained divers (www.gue.com), and we have projects underway in over 15 countries around the world.","100% of this grant would go to ocean cleanups (primarily paying for boat charters and breathing gases for the scuba divers- our two biggest expenses). With this additional funding, we would be able to do more frequent trips and recruit more volunteers. We have a pool of approximately 50 volunteers (divers and deckhands). The people who commit to the cleanups would have their expenses covered on that particular day. Each time we do a cleanup, there are about 10-15 people involved, depending on the mission.","This funding would easily cover us for a year or more. All of the volunteers are already donating their time and their talents, and using their own scuba gear. We are getting donations here and there, plus we are now partnering with Fourth Element ""Ocean Positive,"" a line of swim/ surf wear that is made from recycled fishing nets. They will also be giving us some funding. Lastly, we receive sponsorship from manufacturers of ""ghost net removal"" gear, namely Eezycut and Halcyon.","*$200 per diver for breathing gas X 10 = $2,000 X 24 trips/ year = $48,000
 *$1,500 per boat charter X 24 trips = $36,000
 
 $48,000 + $36,000 = $84,000
 
 Remaining $16,000 for proper training/ certification through Global Underwater Explorers (GUE certifications are required for all volunteer scuba divers), as well as required training for the volunteers (CPR, first aid, oxygen for scuba diving emergencies, etc).
 
 ANY leftover funds will be carried over into the following year.","We will keep monitoring our success with our data spread sheet, as described earlier. It is critical that we have the opportunity to present to as many schools as possible, to increase awareness of this issue. Secondly, it is imperative that we keep this project going! Sadly, there is no shortage of work for us in Los Angeles. There are ghost nets polluting our waters everywhere. We have more recent videos on Vimeo, but your application only seems to recognize YouTube."

This grant will fund a brick-&-mortar locale, centralizing our programs, & fund infrastructure for volunteer engagement, recruitment & training for our respective programs, plus a co-working space where members can connect & create.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,ALL,"We'll rent a commercial space & build infrastructure for The Partnership for Los Angeles’ Creative Education (PLACE), a collaboration between the nonprofits, DSTL Arts, Trade School Los Angeles, & Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles.
 
 With all 3 organizations sharing the space, we're committed to collaborating across all our programs to create a pipeline of arts mentorship & educational opportunities for creative, at-risk youth, emerging artists, & seasoned arts professionals, with various entry points for anyone from the ages of 16 to 116.
 
 The centralized location will house DSTL Arts' programs, including their Arts Mentorship Program for at-risk youth ages 16–21, a new fiscal sponsorship program for individual artists, Art Block (a zine-making workshop series for youth ages 16–21) & Conchas y Café, an arts-literacy & creative writing workshop series for Spanish-speaking adults & caretakers of youth in DSTL Arts' programs.
 
 The space will also host regular, free-to-low-cost educational & professional development workshops for adults ages 18 & over, conducted by Trade School LA volunteers & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA, ranging in subject matter from art appreciation & DIY crafts, to freelance creative business & arts administration. Trade School LA, through barter-based programs, offers pedagogical training to anyone interested in sharing skills through workshops, regardless of age, providing a low-stress environment for knowledge-sharing. Additionally, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will coordinate its Protégé arts-professional mentorship program out of the space.
 
 We'll rent a 1000–1500 square foot space within 6–8 months of funding, & purchase furniture & equipment to convert the space into a gallery & creative workspace for our co-working membership program, including internet, copy, print & phone service.
 
 We'll also purchase volunteer management software for The PLACE. DSTL Arts will utilize up to 10 volunteer arts mentors & interns yearly in support of their Arts Mentorship Program, & Art Block & Conchas y Café creative writing programs. Trade School LA will use up to 75 volunteer instructors & interns yearly in support of their educational workshops. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will use up to 40 volunteers & interns yearly in support of their Leadership Council, “Protégé” emerging arts-professional mentorship program, & professional development workshops. Our shared infrastructure will match skills & interests of all volunteers with the appropriate programs.","DSTL Arts, EAL/LA, & TSLA have identified 3 common challenges we currently face in offering our respective programs: 1) volunteer attrition, 2) participant attrition, & 3) decentralized, nomadic program structures.
 
 These challenges stem from the lack of a dedicated, physical space where we can each coordinate our programs & conduct deeper community engagement. As such, our forming of The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is the solution for many challenges we individually face.
 
 Pooling resources & jointly entering into a lease agreement for a commercial space will eliminate several problems we individually face with constantly traveling to conduct our programs. Logistically, we'll become more efficient with time & resources, utilizing a central, consistent space & programming pipeline to meet the needs of all participants & volunteers, including regular volunteer trainings, & collectively dedicating staff for inter-program support & scheduling.","We'll evaluate The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education annually based on the following goals:
 
 DSTL Arts
 -recruit & train 5 volunteer arts mentors for cohort of 20 total Arts Mentorship Program students, ages 16–21
 -provide 1,500 hours of mentorship to at-risk youth, ages 16–21
 -60% of Arts Mentorship Program students will enroll in, or continue, post-HS degree/certificate programs, 30% will continue HS, graduate, or enter HS-equivalency programs
 -fiscally sponsor 5 emerging women and/or minority artists
 
 EAL/LA
 -pair 16 emerging arts-professionals (age 22 & over) with 16 seasoned arts admin through Protégé mentorship program
 -offer 12 professional development workshops & mixers
 -provide 20 professional development scholarships to emerging arts-professionals serving on Leadership Council
 
 TSLA
 -recruit & train 75 volunteer instructors
 -offer 120 barter-based educational classes, serving 1,000 participants
 
 The PLACE
 -host 16 internships for all programs","The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is comprised of the 3, individual nonprofits: DSTL Arts, Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles, & Trade School Los Angeles. As individual organizations, there do exist other programs & organizations that do similar, if not complementary work to ours. However, we know that as a united force, our partnership will drive the creation of new approaches to arts mentorship, creative education, & professional development for emerging & seasoned artists.
 
 For example, DSTL Arts takes an approach to arts mentorships similar to Venice Arts or Las Fotos Project. Venice Arts provides mentorships focusing on photography & visual storytelling, where Las Fotos Project does the same for young Latinas, exclusively; but DSTL Arts provides mentorship to at-risk youth, ages 16–21, & teaches them to not only develop their artistic talents in creative writing, visual art & photography, but also adds work-readiness training & entrepreneurial skills to the mentorship program, something that not many other arts-education nonprofits do. Our focus is more on teaching transferable skills that will help youth succeed within the creative economy, & in life as a whole.
 
 Emerging Arts Leaders/LA is part of a network of organizations throughout the country that provides professional development opportunities for emerging arts professionals. As the exclusive Los Angeles chapter of the Americans for the Arts-backed initiative, EAL/LA shares only a few similarities with even less organizations & professional associations in LA, such as Arts For LA or the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network.
 
 Trade School LA is the most unique organization of our partnership. TSLA is also part of a larger, international cooperative of Trade School organizations, but in LA, the nearest complementary organization would be the informal association called the Time Bank. With a barter-based system for organizing & engaging in knowledge-sharing workshops, TSLA truly defies typical operating structures for nonprofit organizations.
 
 As a collective, we are creating a pipeline of arts mentorship, education & professional development unlike anything ever seen in LA. By providing programming to individuals from the age of 16 & beyond, we truly believe that our Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education will excel in bringing diverse, creative individuals together for the betterment & economic empowerment of our creative community.","The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education is headed by the nonprofit, DSTL Arts. As the leading force behind this partnership, DSTL Arts has strategically approached fellow nonprofits, Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles & Trade School Los Angeles, in order to create a pipeline for arts mentorship, creative education & professional development for the creative community.
 
 DSTL Arts, the only nonprofit of the group currently holding a 501c3 certification, will act as fiscal receiver of grants & donations for The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA & Trade School LA will be ""contracted"" by DSTL Arts to provide professional development classes & workshops in the commercial space we will lease together. Additionally, EAL/LA & TSLA will aid in the maintenance of a co-working membership program that we'll offer on a sliding-cost-scale for emerging creatives, as well as with a robust volunteer recruitment & training program for all of our programs.
 
 Given the initial cost of leasing & preparing a commercial space for occupancy, DSTL Arts will bear fiscal responsibility for start up costs & future maintenance of the space, thereby leaving a small portion of this grant to be dispersed to Trade School LA & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA for their services. However, other funding is being pursued to cover additional costs related to our programming.
 
 In total, DSTL Arts is projected to receive $94,000 for start-up costs related to the leasing of our space, including the purchase of furniture, equipment, insurance & other unexpected costs. Emerging Arts Leader/LA will receive $1,000 for the provision of professional development workshops & mixers in our space. Trade School LA will receive $3,000 for the scheduling of educational workshops in our space & for recruitment & training of volunteers for our programs. All organizations will also receive administrative workspace & access to infrastructure for the execution of all our programs.
 
 Each organization will designate a board member, advisory board member, or staff member to be part of a steering committee that will provide governance to this partnership, while continuing to receive governance from their respective boards for their individual organizational & programmatic needs. New members to The Partnership for Los Angeles' Creative Education will be vetted through a rigorous application process to ensure the sustainability of the partnership & space.","Forming The Partnership for Los Angeles’ Creative Education, & establishing a permanent space to house all of our programs, will utilize the entirety of the $100,000 grant. As our budget reflects, the majority of these funds will cover start-up expenses related to the opening of a commercial space in a centralized location in the City of Los Angeles.
 
 With the cost of rent, insurance, & general office-related expenses, a small amount of funds will be left over to initiate programming within the space. Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles already has secured funding for their programming, including funding from the Department of Cultural Affairs, the Hewlett Foundation, & other professional-development specific grants. Additionally, Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles already utilizes a corps of volunteers to conduct, plan, & coordinate the majority of their programming, so their overhead costs are minimal as we begin to activate the space.
 
 DSTL Arts has secured funding from the California Arts Council to provide their Art Block & Conchas y Café programs, which have already begun, & this funding will be utilized to further activate the space, once the location is established. DSTL Arts’ Arts Mentorship Program is an ongoing program, & DSTL Arts has applied to various funding sources, while concurrently cultivating donors, to continue providing this program.
 
 Trade School Los Angeles has an established network of volunteer instructors & a shared infrastructure with other Trade School chapters. The funds they receive from this grant will be utilized by Trade School LA to cover small expenses related to their educational workshops & organizational overhead as we begin to activate the space.
 
 We foresee the creation of our co-working membership program generating funds that will sustain our space. All of the funds generated from the membership program will be held in a fund specific to maintenance and rental overhead costs. When it comes to programming, each organization will continue to independently develop funding opportunities for their respective programming costs. As such, DSTL Arts, Trade School LA and Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles will have full access to the space for their individual fundraising activities throughout the year.","The PLACE — Start-up Expenses

 For example, Trade School LA is already expanding their service footprint by establishing a Trade School Long Beach sub-chapter. Trade School LA is coordinating with volunteer instructors in the Long Beach area now to bring barter-based educational workshops through the established Trade School LA sign-up infrastructure. With the establishing of The PLACE, we are bringing stability for Trade School LA to begin recruiting & on-boarding more volunteers while fundraising for their growing overhead costs.
 
 Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles is the exclusive chapter of the Emerging Arts Leaders network in Los Angeles, but there already exists an Emerging Arts Leaders/Orange County, which could potentially work with The PLACE as we look to expand our partnership further south. It would not be difficult to connect with Emerging Arts Leaders/OC once The PLACE establishes a working model in central Los Angeles.
 
 DSTL Arts, after establishing a centralized location with The PLACE, is looking to raise funds for a Mobile Art Lab for their Arts Mentorship Program students who may not have the ability to frequently travel from South LA, or further inland, into Central LA. The idea is to provide a mobile, creative workspace for youth who don’t always have access to tools or space to create at home. With the ultimate goal of expansion, DSTL Arts is very open to establishing chapters in the South Bay area & the San Fernando & San Gabriel Valleys, especially galleries that will display student artwork & provide work-readiness classes in the arts.
 
 The leadership of Trade School LA, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA & DSTL Arts are very committed to creating a pipeline of mentorship & education for creatives at all levels of their career. We are focused on establishing a mutually-supportive infrastructure now, that can eventually be expanded into other markets that will benefit from our pipeline structure. As long as we are able to collectively find funding to expand into other markets & establish centralized spaces, while hiring staff to coordinate our respective programs, we will scale the success of our proposal."

By connecting these underserved communities of color with healthy food growing, food access and education, job training, housing stability programming and homelessness prevention, the LA CAN Justice and Wellness Center will help make LA the healthiest place to live. 
 
 In May 2014, LA CAN purchased a 5,000 square foot warehouse located in Skid Row as our new organizational headquarters. We are renovating the full space and transforming the building into a Justice and Wellness Center that will feature a healthy food access micro-enterprise project. For the past year and half, LA CAN has been operating a weekly pop-up produce market in the Pueblo del Rio public housing community in South LA. The Center expands on this successful and innovative model and will feature a rooftop community garden, a micro-enterprise training space focused on gardening and food retail skills, a community kitchen for nutrition education and food demonstrations, and a pop-up produce market that will provide organic and local produce to the community at below-market prices and with EBT (Food Stamp) access. Furthermore, by incorporating our rooftop garden herbs, vegetables, and fruit into our produce market, we will not only be making Skid Row a healthy food access point, but a source as well. 
 
 Part-time employees, hired from the homeless and extremely low-income constituency in our community, will staff the market and provide outreach and nutrition education. Initially the market will operate weekly in the courtyard in front of our building. This will allow the market to also serve as an entry point for our housing stability and homelessness prevention programming, which includes know your rights training and education, housing and homelessness policy advocacy, and legal services. Additionally, the eventual expansion of our market to other areas in the community, such as public parks, high-foot traffic areas, and social service provider locations, will further meet our goals of eliminating barriers to healthy food access and directly connecting residents to all of our health and wellness programming.","We will be bringing fresh fruits and vegetables to a community where such a direct source has not existed. Thus, one challenge will be building the market and developing an active and engaged customer base. However, with 15 years of experience in community engagement, we are confident that our existing relationships with residents, expertise in resident engagement and outreach, and existing community garden programming and networks will allow us to quickly build a base of customers. We can then begin connecting community residents with fresh produce, nutritional education, job training, housing advocacy, and legal support.","When approaching our work, we strategically follow a model of ongoing: planning-implementation-evaluation-decision making. Our criteria for evaluation is rooted in two questions: 1) Has our strategy engaged, empowered, and educated both new and existing low-income community leaders?; and 2) Has our strategy led to policy or practices change that strengthens human rights and equitably distributes resources among all stakeholders, with direct benefits to low-income people of color?
 
 We will supplement this general evaluation approach with community surveys that will help inform our market and nutrition education choices before we launch. Out of these survey participants, we will create a community team of 10-12 residents who are participating in our project and that we will regularly convene to track their purchasing, engagement in nutritional programming, and overall health and wellness outcomes.","There are many organizations doing complementary work in Skid Row, including affordable housing developers, homeless service providers, health and mental health care providers, and others. However, there is no other similar project in the Skid Row community and, in fact, there are no other organizations focused on changing the food access environment or creating resident-led projects and advocacy campaigns. An overwhelming need for shelter or housing, primary health care, mental health services, and other resources, as well as decades of disinvestment by government agencies, has left Skid Row experiencing a continual state of crisis. Yet, despite the enormous challenges, in recent years housed and unhoused residents have been taking leadership and initiative to improve their community. The proposed project is a result of that initiative and innovation of residents to create community-led solutions to the problems they face. 
 
 The unique aspects of the project include: 1) the project is planned, led and implemented by homeless and low-income residents whose skills and talents are generally overlooked; 2) utilizing micro-enterprise as a means of providing much needed healthy food to an extremely low-income community and building skills for a population that has been disconnected or excluded from mainstream employment; and 3) combining much needed improvements to the built environment with direct goods and services that are needed will lead to tangible community improvements not often experienced within Skid Row.","We will work with a number of organizations as a means of outreaching to community residents, identifying potential participants in programming, and as sites for our market when it goes mobile. These include, but are not limited to, Downtown Women’s Center, Skid Row Housing Trust, the Los Angeles Catholic Worker, Homeless Health Care Los Angeles, Lamp Community, and Los Angeles Poverty Department. However, this aspect of the work is part of ongoing working relationships between our organizations and thus we will not be utilizing funded partners for this specific project.","The total annual budget to implement the healthy food access components of the Skid Row Justice and Wellness Center is $175,000. We will cover the additional costs with other grant funding and individual donations, of which approximately 50 percent has already been secured.","Personnel:

This market has successfully created a new and sustainable source of fresh produce in an extremely low-income community, provided local employment opportunities, and distributes 0.6 tons of produce each month. Our project also builds on our streetscape garden at our Skid Row location, which has more than 20 active residents maintaining it, harvesting food grown, and providing it to the community through food demonstrations and meals at community meetings. 
 
 We are fully confident that the support we receive from LA 2050 will allow us to continue to expand this proven model for creating a healthy LA. Once operational, we envision building other community gardens and incorporating produce grown in these spaces into our market, expanding the locations and days we are able to operate the market, and sharing this model with other organizations throughout Los Angeles. 
 
 We know our model for increasing the health of poor communities of color through community education, gardening, healthy food access, and micro-enterprise works. With the help of LA 2050, we can continue to help make LA the healthiest place to live."
5102312,The Story Project,2015207,,,We propose the creation of a media dialogue between rival communities throughout the city of Los Angeles that erases violence by humanizing the surrounding neighborhood. Stories have power. Media is a way of sharing those stories.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"LA is a city of communities and with it are cultures that are all too often at odds. Since 1998, The Story Project has been bridging gaps through media education teaching storytelling through filmmaking, screenwriting, photography, poetry and many other devices that encourage self expression. Our intention is simple, create a citywide media program in video that shares challenges and desires from those whose daily struggle is a matter of life and death. Often this is found in the form of gang affiliations. What The Story Project proposes is to create a series of films from various communities that explore what it is like to live in their community. The idea is that through media storytelling the similarities will temper feuds and breed cooperation and peace. The project will have its own portal and support staff in addition to team members that will reach into the community to mentor and coach all involved.","Dealing with rival gangs is a very risky on a number of fronts. First, there needs to be a desire to want change, without it everything remains stagnant. This is going to have to be accomplished through powerful activism and education that will provide an education to those involved. There needs to be a tangible level of optimism that is felt by those involved. If our participants struggle to uncover a positive future than this will have no long term value. And lastly, the city needs to endorse this cooperation, possible giving us a physical venue giving passersby a destination of change.",Evaluation will occur through accomplishment. We will have deadlines just like any other type of project with project managers and benchmarks. The Story Project was founded on the basis of incorporating the local media landscape into our classrooms and this program will be no different. We will reach out to the professional TV and film industry for mentors to work with participants in all enrolled communities.,"We have worked with groups such as 826LA and Young Storytellers in the past but The Story Project is unique in that we are all media based and have been since our inception in 1998. The idea has caught on, as it should, but The Story Project is proud to be one of the first on the scene.","This box is very much TBD. However, we are very active with the Boys and Girls Clubs throughout Los Angeles and Central High School in the Mar Vista Gardens housing projects. They will absolutely be included in all aspects of this project. I did have a recent meeting with the director of media projects at Venice Arts and continue to have an open dialogue, including them would be a please.

The success of this program in such a wide metropolitan city as Los Angeles will absolutely pave the way to further this type of outreach in other cities throughout the country. Based on this factor we would plan additional community outreach across the nation and create proposals for corporate involvement and sponsorship.

5102261,The Thrive Center at Samohi,2015174,,SMMUSD: 956002855,"Teens are facing a mental health crisis due to a complex interplay of factors that takes many forms, including substance abuse, social isolation, depression, and suicidal ideation. The Thrive Center at Santa Monica High School will tackle the crisis head-on through coordinated wellbeing services and positive psychology. This next generation school-based health center will be a place where teens learn how to do more than just survive - they will find the support and tools needed to thrive.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Santa Monica High School, SMMUSD, Santa Monica",None,"As a regional Title 1 school, Samohi serves a diverse population of 3,100 students from a wide range of cultures, backgrounds, and households. Samohi is also at the frontline of an unprecedented adolescent mental health crisis experienced locally, regionally, and nationally. According to Centers for Disease Control, 20% of American children ages 3-17 have a mental health issue, a rate that has steadily increased since 1994, with suicide as the leading cause of death among this age group in 2014. Regionally, over 16% of youth in LA County suffer from emotional and mental health problems, with 32% of 7th-12th graders reporting depressive feelings and nearly 20% experiencing suicidal thoughts (UCLA Center for Policy & Research). In our own backyard, we have found shockingly high rates of substance abuse, depression, social isolation, and thoughts of suicide among Santa Monica high school students that exceed regional averages. 
 
 Adolescent mental and behavioral health issues stem from a complex interplay of factors. Reliance on traditional clinical approaches to address this crisis is not getting the job done. Santa Monica will become the first city and school district in LA County to create a center providing coordinated services focused on youth wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will not be your typical school-based health center. It will be more than a dingy office with a bowl of condoms, a nurse, and some DARE posters. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a vibrant space putting cutting-edge wellbeing research into practice. Youth will learn strategies to address the full spectrum of factors influencing their personal wellbeing, both in the immediate and long-term. Co-created with students, activities will focus on both mental and physical health, including stress management, building connections with others, and other wellbeing-boosters. This will serve as the foundation for lifelong empowerment to better understand and take charge of improving one’s personal wellbeing. The Thrive Center at Samohi will be a key component in a suite of collective impact strategies to actively improve the health and wellbeing of our community’s most valuable resource: our youth. 
 
 Mental health issues impact communities regardless of background, economics, or other demographic characteristics. What we learn in Santa Monica will be open and scalable to communities throughout Los Angeles dealing with this adolescent mental and behavioral health crisis.","1: No Model Exists. We will revolutionize school-based health services using wellbeing research and positive psychology. As an internationally-recognized leader, we can leverage lessons learned and established partnerships to develop an effective, sustainable program. 
 3: Student Skepticism. School-based health centers are clinical with an undeniable hospital vibe. As such, use rates are typically low. The Thrive Center will be radically different. The space and services will be co-created with students and oriented toward positivity. 
 3: Adult Skepticism. Wellbeing is often confused with happiness, and therefore easily dismissed. We have been working for 4 years to build awareness and solidify wellbeing as a credible framework for understanding the myriad factors impacting people’s lives. We have established mechanisms for measuring wellbeing and a network of supporters. Hard data, early adopters, and updated educator and service provider training will help us to counter skepticism.","The Thrive Center at Samohi was conceived as part of a suite of strategies to address critical challenges faced by people in our community. These challenges were identified through development of a broad definition of wellbeing first as part of our youth-focused Santa Monica Cradle to Career Initiative and then scaled to the community at large through our award-winning Wellbeing Project. Based on these definitions, we developed mechanisms to measure levels of wellbeing in our community. The Youth Wellbeing Report Card, released in 2012 and updated in 2014, revealed striking baseline findings about the state of mental health and rate of substance abuse among our children, especially among high school students. Success of the Thrive Center will be measured in both micro and macro terms - outputs like rate of use, clinical contact hours, number of faculty trained, as well as moving the dial on adolescent mental health and substance abuse rates as shown in the youth wellbeing report card.","School-based health services is not a new concept. Over 2,000 programs exist nationwide, with 271 in California and 72 in LA County. The majority of programs focus on a narrow clinical set of traditional services. Clinical services are an important 1st step, but only a small fraction take youth engagement and limited wellness-oriented services into account. 
 
 There are other evolving models as well. In Los Angeles, the LA Trust for Children’s Health has worked with LAUSD to update their school-based mental health centers to deal with the current crisis. Located at 14 high priority areas, these Wellness Centers are more in alignment with the goals of The Thrive Center and we have partnered with the LA Trust to learn from their example. Our project seeks to take the concept further by combining their lessons learned with our work in advancing community wellbeing. 
  
 Wellbeing services are emerging as effective ways to address the complex interplay of factors in mental and behavioral health. For example, CalState Northridge established the Oasis Center in response to a growing mental health crisis on campus. While CSUN’s program is not targeted to the same demographic as The Thrive Center, it is an important contribution to this next generation of wellbeing-oriented school-based health services. 
 Beyond LA, there is a growing coalition reimagining the potential of school-based health programs. The San Francisco Wellness Initiative is a dedicated to improving the health, wellbeing, and academic success of the city’s 16,000 public high school students. The program is similar in that it is based on an updated view of health. Services provided by adolescent health professionals will help students learn to deal with the various mental health stressors they encounter. This initiative is not a competitor of The Thrive Center. Rather it is evidence that this emerging holistic focus on coordinated wellbeing services is the next frontier of school-based health services. 
 Our program is different in that it is data-driven, partnership-based, and will be co-created with students to ensure the end result meets the needs of and appeals to our primary end users. While we are starting small, Samohi is a Title 1 school with a highly diverse population, 20% of which live in surrounding areas of LA. This, plus our existing partnerships, will help us establish an open knowledge sharing network with a built-in reach well beyond the borders of Santa Monica.","The Thrive Center is part of a suite of strategies to address the health and wellbeing of children from cradle to career. Bringing this concept to life will require a multi-agency collective impact approach. Led by the City of Santa Monica and SMMUSD, Thrive Center partners include:

 RAND Corporation: As a partner on Santa Monica’s Wellbeing Project, RAND’s extensive research and analysis of community wellbeing measurement and interventions will help inform development of The Thrive Center Concept, including impact measurement. Share: $0k","As part of a collective impact collaborative, The Thrive Center is supported by the City of Santa Monica, SMMUSD, and partners through direct funding and in-kind services. Start up costs include resources needed to secure a physical location, planning resources to develop and implementation and service plan, and one time technical infrastructure. Total project implementation is estimated to cost approximately $300,000, as follows: 
 
 Facilities: $50k
 Health Services Staff, Infrastructure & Service Delivery Tracking: $100k 
 Coordinated Mental Health Care & Direct Student services: $75k
 Mindfulness Capacity Building Program Development: $30k
 Human Centered Design Services: $25k
 
 Ongoing operation is estimated to cost $75k-$100k annually, depending on services provided and hours of operation. Both startup and ongoing operation costs are in line with national averages, according to the Alliance for School-Based Health Centers. 
 
 Startup and ongoing operation costs above and beyond the $100k LA2050 grant will be funded through a $200k 4-year grant from the City of Santa Monica and a $50k in-kind contribution from SMMUSD for facilities. As part of its partnership in the project, Venice Family Clinic will also use its expertise in securing health reimbursements to assist with ongoing operation costs. Other potential funding could come via Federal health care reform, which has provided a much-needed financial boost for school-based health centers. For the first time in history, dedicated funding has been allocated for these services ($200M over 4 years for the construction and equipment for centers). Thrive Center partners will explore all available funding options to ensure continued operation of this program.","100% of this $100,000 grant will be applied directly toward startup costs to create The Thrive Center at Samohi, to be broken down as follows: 
 
 Venice Family Clinic: Administrative support and fundraising activities, $25k
 Family Services of Santa Monica: Inter-agency coordination to create and deliver services: $25k
 Yes For Schools: Additional program design and service delivery: $30k
 Human Centered Design Partner TBD: Co-creation of physical space and supporting technology: $10k
 LA Trust for Children’s Health: Technical assistance with program development: $10k
 
 Additional startup and ongoing costs will be covered by in kind contributions, existing partnerships, City grant funds, and other sources.","The Thrive Center is a highly scalable concept with the potential to reach tens of thousands of young people throughout Los Angeles. Growing this project can be achieved in 3 phases.
 
 Immediate scalability will focus on reaching all 3,000 students at Samohi, over 20% of whom live in low income communities throughout Los Angeles. Our multi-pronged strategy for reaching the entire school population includes student co-creation, integrated school-wide health nudges, and embedding wellbeing science and positive psychology into curriculum, training, school culture, and student support activities. By involving students in the design of services, space, and outreach, we will ensure that the Center is created with end users in mind from the start, thereby increasing its uptake among the student community. Health nudges are a flexible and proven to work. They can include text message campaigns, modifications to the school cafeteria and other common spaces based on the science of choice architecture, and modernized public health messages based on principles of behavioral psychology. Finally, by integrating wellbeing into regular faculty training and student support services, concepts including mindfulness, mindset training, and positive psychology will become embedded into the school day.
 
 The next level of scale will extend this pilot program beyond Samohi to SMMUSD’s robust school-based mental health infrastructure that provides support services for students at 4 Title 1 schools, including John Adams Middle School. Based on what we learn about growing wellbeing services at Samohi, we will be able to replicate our model throughout an existing school-based mental health service infrastructure that will reach students throughout Santa Monica’s school district.
 
 The third level will focus reach beyond Santa Monica through our established relationships with the LA Trust for Children’s Health and Alliance for School Based Health Centers. By creating an open knowledge sharing network through these partnerships, we will help disseminate The Thrive Center wellbeing services model for replication in at least 14 existing student wellness centers located in high priority areas throughout Los Angeles."
5102315,TheLab: LA’s Place for Scientific Exploration,2015210,,,"We are looking to acquire additional scientific and safety equipment with the goals of expanding our youth scientist program, community classes, and workshops. We will design classes most suitable to the needs and capabilities of our community.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"TheLab has a three part proposal.
 
 1. We need to increase our research and safety equipment. TheLab will offer more workbench spaces to accommodate more members and classes with a larger number of participants. We will install more equipment to make the lab more functional and safer. Our goal is an open laboratory space with multiple workbenches and a common area for group events and presentations. 
 
 2. TheLab is actively involved in mentoring youth scientists. Cory Tobin has volunteered countless hours personally mentoring students. His success is undeniable. All of his students have won science fairs at their schools, won awards at the LA County Science Fairs, and won awards at the California State Science Fairs. One of his students was selected to be a participant in the Broadcom Masters and had the opportunity to meet President Obama to honor his successes. Two of his students participated in the iGEM competition impressing graduate and post graduate level scientists with their presentation and knowledge. The successes of these youth scientists are amazing and will propel these students into incredible opportunities. 
 
 TheLab needs to expand to have a permanent program for student scientists. Without more resources this will not be possible. TheLab will provide the opportunity for students in the LA area to have a safe and resourceful laboratory where they can learn from other students and experienced scientists to conduct professional research experiments. 
 
 3. TheLab will offer classes on topics ranging from sophisticated research such as CRISPR to beginner level topics such as tree grafting. We will accept suggestions to create classes to meet the needs of our community. We believe that these classes are our best way to engage with the community. Many of our classes require no prerequisite knowledge allowing beginners to become familiar with laboratory equipment and proper research and safety protocol. With these skills they can advance to independent research or meet with other members to form research teams.
 
 In order to accomplish parts 2 and 3 of our proposal we are asking for your help to fund part 1.
 
 Biotechnology is expanding at an incredible rate. We are experiencing a wave of new DIY biologists that are doing research comparable to that of professionals. Our community is excited to learn how the world works and be part of the science of the future. With your help we will be able to expand TheLab and open our doors to all of LA.","Currently our biggest challenge is finding funding. With your help we will finally have the financial resources necessary to purchase new equipment and repair existing equipment to make our laboratory safer and more functional. One challenge we will face is find good quality equipment at discounted prices. With our established network of connections we will work diligently to stretch the money as far as possible to acquire the most resources.
 
 Once we have these new resources in place they will accommodate more members, more student programs, and more classes. It will be a challenge to manage these expanded programs. We will be faced with needing new class curricula as well as needing classes to educate our members about how to properly use our new equipment and how to work safely in our laboratory. We will rely on volunteer hours from our experienced members to execute these classes.","TheLab will evaluate our progress by keeping detailed records of our participants in each of our programs.
 
 1. For the youth program we will track how many students are involved. The students’ success in the program will be evaluated by our experienced members and the students’ placements at the local and state science fairs. When possible we will assist students in publishing their research in professional peer reviewed scientific journals.
 
 2. For our classes we will track participation and provide surveys after each class for our students to give feedback. We will use the participation numbers and the surveys to determine the classes that are working best and which need to be revamped.
 
 3. We will also have routine meetings with our members to discuss their individual research work and get updates on their progress. From this we will know how we can assist our members, possibly through acquiring necessary equipment or teaching classes on skills needed to continue their research.","TheLab was formed in 2011 and is still the only organization of our kind open to the community of Los Angeles. Similar organizations exist in other areas: Biocurious in Sunnyvale, Genspace in Brooklyn, HiveBio in Seattle, BUGGS in Baltimore, and others around the world. Southern California and particularly Los Angeles has seen a recent growth in startup incubators but these facilities only offer opportunities to biotech companies.
 
 TheLab is very unique in that it offers any person with any level of education the opportunity to get involved with science. We pride ourselves in serving the community with a wide range of science opportunities without discriminating based on academic pedigree or age.","Since its formation, TheLab has been sustaining itself solely through donations. We believe that with this money we will be able to increase the resources of TheLab allowing it to raise more money through educational programs. All of the money from the award will go to TheLab to reach our goal of building a bigger and better community laboratory. We do not intend to distribute the money to any partners.","Our budget for the equipment we intend to acquire is $98,061. We do not plan to exceed the budget. The execution of parts 2 and 3 of our proposal is not critically dependent on the acquisition of all the equipment listed. For example, it is necessary that we increase our workbench space to accommodate larger classes. However it is not immediately necessary that we purchase additional microscopes.
 
 We will prioritize purchasing safety equipment to guarantee that we have a safe work environment. Beyond that, we will prioritize equipment purchases based on the number of students who will benefit. If we are not able to purchase all the equipment listed in the budget, we will run additional classes to generate the income necessary for acquiring those items.","Equipment

 Upon completion in February of 2016, Shane's Inspiration will transform these playgrounds, along with others already in progress throughout the County of Los Angeles, into classrooms bringing 3,500 children of all abilities together where they will learn profound lessons of acceptance, understanding and respect for diversity. 
 
 Children with disabilities are 66% more likely to be bullied than their typically developing peers due to damaging misconceptions and bias. By discovering our similarities and connections, children are able to build powerful bridges of friendship and inclusion.
 
 Educators will deliver interactive class workshops to elementary and middle school students designed to increase understanding of people with disabilities which will include:
 
 Writing and group discussion about feelings and assumptions about disabilities;
 
 A fast-paced verbal game that helps differentiate between disability fact and myth;
 
 A powerful video shows children with disabilities in their daily lives, giving students a chance to identify with their peers; and
 
 Simulation exercises offer possible perspectives of individuals with disabilities
 
 Staff workshops on social inclusion best practices and how to support students
 
 Students are then prepared for their field trip with specific tools to interact with peers who have non-verbal communication, sensory processing differences, and physical challenges. 
 
 We provide transportation from the campus to the playground via local transit companies. Our staff meet the students at the playground, where we support children with and without disabilities during a day of integration and play.

 This powerful acceptance of our diversity will make LA the very best place to play!","We anticipate that we may face the challenge of educators who have very impacted schedules. This could make some hesitant to initiate a new program for their students. To this end, we have aligned the education program with the Common Core and Character Counts to provide educators with an opportunity to satisfy mandated learning goals, while also providing inclusion strategies for the ever increasing integrated classroom. We examined what educators required for their existing workload and designed the program to meet those needs rather than add more work. 
 
 In order to provide the educators with further clarity, we are including a professional development training video that will walk the educators through each step of the program implementation. A free webinar series will further explain in detail the process for implementing the program.","""You can learn more about someone in an hour of play than in a year of conversation."" Plato
 
 Our educators will measure attitudinal shifts in students via pre- and post-field trip written assessments. Prior to their field trips, students may communicate that they are: fearful of people in wheelchairs; sad and believe people with disabilities are unable to live a fulfilling life; afraid of touching people with disabilities because they are contagious; and afraid of being hurt by them. 
 
 Written assessments after the field trips may reveal a major shift in perception. In one classroom of 5th graders, the words sad and bad were repeated 90 times in their written assessments. After their field trip, those same words were used 19 times.
 
 Educators will also be given a written assessment form to provide valuable feedback on their experience of the program.
 
 It is our goal to work in partnership with a local university to create a broader assessment of this program.","We live in an extraordinary community that features the contributions of many individuals, non-profit, and for profit entities that are making substantial impact in the area of play in many ways. We know that there are non-profits that provide inclusive recreation programs and non-profits that provide ability awareness programs, but to our knowledge, Shane's Inspiration is the only organization combining inclusive playground design/development/programming into a play based structure which transforms the playgrounds into an outdoor classroom designed at eliminating bullying and bias.
 
 Shane’s Inspiration's expertise also includes professional development workshops, which it being translated into a DVD that will walk educators and parents through the program, step-by-step. This will:
 
 Increase awareness of the need for and benefits of social inclusion in the education community, providing examples of best practices 
 
 Increase focus on and support of social inclusion on school campuses
 
 Provide examples and important talking points to increase the understanding and use of the classroom workshop content
 
 Offer step-by-step instructions on how to connect children with a wide variety of challenges
 
 The DVD will be broken into modular, 3-5 minute segments that walk educators through:
 • Pre-field trip classroom workshop material, emphasizing key themes and talking points
 • How to facilitate social interaction between children with typical abilities and children with: 
 • Autism and Sensory Processing Disorders
 • Physical impairments (Cerebral Palsy, Spina Bifida, vision impairment, etc.)
 • Intellectual disabilities (Down Syndrome) with an emphasis on how to facilitate communication with children with no or limited verbal skills
 • Post-field trip classroom workshop material, emphasizing key themes and activities to help synthesize the experience
 • How to utilize and integrate the Academic Curriculum and its key features into classroom content
 With an investment in place, production of the DVD can be completed in 3 to 4 months.
 
 DVD Distribution: Thanks to our ongoing partnership with Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest district in the nation, we have a powerful distribution channel in Southern California. The audience includes teachers, principals, and parents, offering a wide range of consumers. LAUSD is also interested in utilizing Shane’s Inspiration’s professional development services online, offering a wider user base via webinars.","Implementing the Together We Play L.A.! initiative in the next 12 months is achievable because Shane’s Inspiration will develop this project and expand its reach while building on the strong foundation of partnerships and programs that have been created since our inception. The success of this initiative will rely heavily on three key partnerships: Parks; Schools; and Community. 
 
 1. Parks. Shane’s Inspiration has designed and developed 39 inclusive playgrounds in the County of Los Angeles, 30 of which were built in partnership with the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department. The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department will be donating the funding for the equipment and construction of the fully inclusive playgrounds at Vermont Gage and Jackie Tatum parks. They will also be responsible for liability and maintenance of these vibrant park communities. Therefore, the locations for the play aspect of the initiative have been created and identified. 
 
 2. Schools. Grant funding received will help us expand the program into South Central Los Angeles where resources are scarce. There are 31 schools within the catchment zip codes of these playgrounds. Upon completion, we will engage the schools with our education program, offering field trip transportation and facilitation. The schools necessary for the success of this initiative have been identified in South Central and will receive the program free of charge.
 
 Schools citywide will receive a collective $25,000 in bus transportation for program field trips. This will include approximately 70 buses for over 50 schools.
 
 3. Shane’s Inspiration has established an extensive Community Outreach program in order to promote these playgrounds to the public. We plan on utilizing these existing outreach mechanisms to promote the Together We Play L.A.! initiative to a large and diverse audience. Outreach partners include: Exceptional Children's Foundation, Best Start Communities, First 5 LA, Regional Centers, LAUSD Schools.","The total cost for this project is $1,408,516. 
 
 Shane's Inspiration has secured a commitment from the City of Los Angeles for the playground and construction costs totally $1,150,000. 
 
 Program expansion of the program, as well as the implementation of the city wide program facilitation will total $258,516. If awarded the $100,000 grant, this would leave $158,516, $120,000 of which has already been committed. 
 
 Shane's Inspiration will bridge the remaining gap through corporate, foundation and individual gifts. Donors to our programs include: Seba Foundation, Landscape Structures Inc., The Green Foundation, Joseph Drown Foundation, Phantanos Foundation, Discover a Star Foundation, Pilgrim Studios, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, John W. Carson Foundation, Remington Foundation. 
 
 Shane's Inspiration also generates substantial revenue from four annual events including a Gala, a Golf Tournament, a Tea and a Walk n Roll 5K event.","$25,000 - BUS TRANSPORTATION - We estimate the coordination of approximately 70 buses for approximately 50 schools. This is based on $350 per bus, transporting 3,500 children. 
 $35,000 - Completion of the Professional Development Training Program DVD for Educators 
 
 $10,000 Printing - Ability Awareness Workshop Materials, Day 1/2/3; Supplemental Materials; Classroom Poster 
 
 $5,000 Postage
 
 $5k for professional development workshops
 
 $5k for parent outreach and education in those communities (supporting social integration holistically requires parent education and support)
 
 $5k for paraprofessional development workshops
 
 $5k for technology upgrades to support and integrated, user-friendly sites for schools to access and integrate our curriculum","Shane's Inspiration will continue to partner with the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Depart to identify/design/develop parks in under served, resource poor communities that have the need for an inclusive playground. 
 
 The plan for scaling the education program is to continue to streamline the materials and structure, providing educators with the tools necessary to independently facilitate the program for the children in their classroom. This streamlined approach will support the educators facilitation of the pre-field trip workshop, as well as the post. We would continue to participate in the actual field trips, as our staff is well trained in playground integration strategies. This approach would help scale the program into a substantial number of schools throughout Los Angeles in impoverished communities.
 
 The program is now available free of charge to download for educators on our website at: 
 
 http://www.shanesinspiration.org/education-inclusion-lunch-box/
 
 On a broader impact scale, Shane's Inspiration's work in Los Angeles is currently serving as an example for other communities on how to create play environments that unite the whole of the community. Shane's Inspiration and the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department travel nationally and internationally to promote the replication of these playgrounds and programs to a global audience. 
 
 The 37 playgrounds developed in Los Angeles have sparked a world wide movement in inclusive play, generating Shane's Inspiration projects in 15 states, as well as in Mexico, Ecuador, Israel and four in conjunction with the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics in Canada and Russia. As members of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), Shane's Inspiration is participating in conversations with the CGI Disability Strategy Group and Too Small To Fail Initiative regarding the importance of inclusive play environments as they pertain to community resiliency. 
 
 We will also utilize print, radio, television, and social media avenues to promote this initiative, raising a broader understanding of the importance of dissolving the barriers that divide us and the opportunities to connect. 
 
 The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will provide another important opportunity for Los Angeles to lead the way in play - today - tomorrow - into 2050 and beyond!"
5102051,Training LA Nonprofits With The Best Ideas To Create The Biggest Impact,2015030,,,"We will host a 4-month training program for startup nonprofits that are based in and serving greater Los Angeles. The program will teach the most promising new nonprofits to create sustainable business models, to use data to innovate faster, and to build partnerships that enable their organizations to scale. Our LA2050 program will culminate with a pitch competition, where industry leaders and our participants will gather to showcase their bold ideas and make LA the best place to create change.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,,Learn,"Our program trains promising nonprofit startups to create sustainable business models, to use data to measure their impact and innovate faster, and to create a network of partners that will enable their organizations to scale. At Change Better, we promote best practices for the nonprofit space, bringing in new techniques and knowledge from other sectors to help organizations maximize their limited resources and achieve greater impact.
 
 Over the 4 months of the program, we will train participating organizations on business strategies, data systems and metrics, and partnerships and collaboration through the Change Better Startup Curriculum. The curriculum brings together best practices from the for-profit business and tech startup worlds into the context of running a nonprofit. It’s been tested, refined, and proven to work over the course of the last year and a half. 
 
 The training culminates with Pitch Day where we will bring all of our program participants together with other leaders in the LA nonprofit community for a high-energy, big-stakes competition where five attendees will walk away with $1,000 grants. 
 
 While LA has been a hub for artists, creatives, and entrepreneurs for years, the geography makes it a difficult city in which to connect. This pitch day brings together the best and brightest nonprofit startups from all corners of the county to meet, and form partnerships. We believe that all attendees will be able to bring back skills that will allow them to achieve the LA2050 create goals.","One challenge is selecting the best startup nonprofits for the program. We believe that a part of finding the most innovative solutions means looking in new places and bringing resources to unexpected places. While we have roots in Los Angeles, we’re excited to explore the potential that’s simmering in greater LA.
 
 In selecting organizations to join the program, we will look for 5 key characteristics: 
 
 1. They value their community. Participants have cultivated long-term, respectful relationships in their community. They listen to community members and understand the problems they face.
 
 2. They have identified an impactful solution. This solution has a proven potential for high impact based on early indicators.
 
 3. They are devoted to testing & learning. They are ready to build, measure, and learn. 
 
 4. They know the value of collaboration. Participants are open, transparent, and self-aware. 
 
 5. They have long-term vision that solves the root of the problem.","Our goal is to provide best-in-class resources for nonprofits, so we use data to improve the quality of our resources. 
 
 To measure our program, we look at the type and frequency of member needs, the kinds of solutions we offer, and the rate of adoption on the insights we provide. In addition, we conduct extensive ethnographic interviews at the end of each program to gather qualitative data on participants’ experiences. 
 
 Through this framework, we have consistently witnessed the impact of our program. Our members have told us that we’ve created a safe space to explore new ideas and build the skills needed to be successful. As one of them explained:
 
 “There are two opposing pulls in running an organization – the passion and the business. I do this because I’m passionate about it and it’s always been hard for us to balance that side with the business side. You brought those two pieces closer together and showed us how the business can support the mission.”","There are other organizations that support nonprofit startups and social entrepreneurs (Echoing Green, Ashoka, Be Social Change, PresenTense) and even other nonprofit training programs (Fast Forward, Beespace, Points of Light).
  
 Change Better is unique because: 
 
 - We look different than your average training program. We meet our nonprofits where they are. Instead of requiring the organization to pick up what they’re doing and meet in our space, we plug into participants' location and schedules.
 
 - We work differently. We train new nonprofits with the latest trends in the tech innovation space with an emphasis on lean startup and agile development. The focus is on skill training by collaborating. We’re not just consultants and we’re not just advisors. We’re partners.
 
 - We hold our participants accountable to impact. We give open and honest feedback. Each organization that works with Change Better builds metrics by which they’re judging their work. We aren’t afraid to speak up when they’re not getting the results on those metrics, then we help them take that information and pivot.
  
 Our founders started in the nonprofit sector and launched their careers at one of the leading nonprofits in the U.S. – DoSomething.org. In true lean startup fashion, they learned by doing. Ellie and Amanda received their formative education at Do Something, where they helped the organization transform into a powerhouse nonprofit on the cutting edge of technology, data, and social good. As the leaders of the social entrepreneurship programs, Ellie and Amanda trained many of the best young change makers in the country to build strong, strategic businesses.
  
 Our Board of Directors is made up of a Chief of Marketing, a Head of Product, an Economist, and a Data Scientist – a team that’s distinctly different than an average nonprofit board. Our board is more reminiscent of a tech startup than a nonprofit. And that’s intentional. We are building a team of experts in lean startup and agile development to bring these movements to the nonprofit space.","We know there is power in numbers and in order to make an impact, it takes a village. So we plan to engage many partners in this project - people to refer and identify the best nonprofit startups for the training program, partners to organize the Pitch Day, and leaders in the LA community to give guidance and support to our participants along the way.
 
 The first way we will be mobilizing partners is through our selection process. In order to find the best startups for the program, we will need to look in all corners of the nonprofit community. We plan to reach out to key players in the LA area to help - including the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab at USC Marshall School of Business, the Impact Hub, Community Partners, Taproot Foundation, and we would love to engage the team at the Goldhirsh Foundation as well.
 
 We also plan to collaborate with partners and volunteers to put together an exciting, productive, engaging Pitch Day. We will work with partners to host the event, and we are in the process of securing the space and a food sponsor. We will also be inviting leaders in the social innovation community - both funders and nonprofit executives to network with and provide feedback to our pitchers. 
 
 While all of the funds of this grant will go directly towards Change Better, we will use a small portion of the funds (as outlined in the budget section) to pay for speaking fees for the Pitch Day.","The total cost of the program is $111,270.00. This includes the full cost of the training program, the full cost of the Pitch Day, and the corresponding staff required to make the program successful.
 
 The $100,000 contribution from LA2050 will be critical to get this initiative off the ground. The remaining $11,270.00 will be covered by additional fundraising efforts. Change Better’s fundraising comes from three primary areas: foundations and grantmakers, individual contributions, and earned income from our consulting arm. We expect to cover the additional costs through a combination of dollars raised from individuals and from our consulting income.","We will use the $100,000 grant from Goldhirsh Foundation to cover the costs of running the 4-month training program for four LA-based nonprofits, and to cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day, including the four nonprofits, as well as leaders from around 20 other LA-based nonprofit organizations. Approximately 53% of the funds will go towards the training program, and 47% of the funds will go towards hosting Pitch Day. 
 
 To cover the costs of the LA-based training program: 
 - $46,900 in staff costs including coverage of the Executive Director (30% of time during the training program); Program Director (60% of time during the training program); Program Associate (80% of time spent during the training program); and Creative Director
 - $4,000 will go towards a stipend for an intern who will help with the program execution and administration, part-time for Spring semester, and 30-hours a week for summer semester
 - $1,500 will go towards marketing and program materials 
 - $800 will go towards office supplies in support of the program 
 
 To cover the costs of the capstone Pitch Day: 
 - $22,000 will go towards the staff costs of planning and executing the Pitch Day
 - $5,000 will go towards the 5 grant winners of the pitch competition. The winners will be determined based on scoring of their pitch. 
 - $19,800 will go towards the costs of executing the event itself including cost of space, food, supplies, promotion, speaking fees, and travel.","Our plan to scale is focused on 1) improving the success rate of the organizations who participate in our training and 2) fostering collaboration in the LA nonprofit community to create a space where the best solutions thrive and have the support networks they need to grow.
 
 The organizations that participate in the program will build the skills needed to improve their impact and scale their work in the LA area. In this way, investing in Change Better has a multiplier effect. LA2050 funding will allow Change Better to reach more nonprofits in Southern California, who in turn will help more people in their respective local communities. 
 
 From this multiplier effect, we expect to see an increase in jobs per capita; an increase in women and minority owned businesses; an increase in the number of high growth startups; and an increase in venture capital investment -- all driving progress though our participants increased capacity and success. 
 
 Next, we will scale the success of our program by fostering collaboration between the organizations in our program and the other groups participating in the capstone Pitch Day. We expect attendees at the event to make the connections needed to take their work to the next level.
 
 Each organization that participates in the training program goes through an extensive exploration of their partnership strategy, focusing on their areas of need and of leading strengths. Through the 4 months, we create a map of potential partnership opportunities and rehearse putting those options into practice. The startups that go through the Change Better training program come to Pitch Day ready and eager to grow their network. 
 
 By facilitating this network building, we can maximize the potential of the nonprofit community in LA. We can create a city where startup organizations have the connections for their work to thrive and nonprofit veterans have access to the freshest new ideas on the block."
5102251,Training leaders to launch new and redesigned next generation schools in Los Angeles,2015167,,,"Reframe engages frontline educators in collaborative school design, rethinking the factory school model in favor of designs that personalize learning for students. Our programs include: free, monthly workshops across LA; deeper 2-day bootcamps; a 6-month Redesign program open to any existing school (public, charter, private); and a prestigious 1-year Next Gen Fellowship for leaders who want to launch innovative new schools. Reframe will help LA become the next hub for K-12 education innovation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,,Learn,"The technology revolution in education is accelerating. Despite LAUSD's iPad rollout challenges, the silver lining is that there is now a hyper-awareness that education technology is a tool that needs to be complemented by clear instructional plans and more investment in talent. 
 
 Reframe Labs will bring together educators, central office leaders, families, and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of school. We will facilitate professional learning experiences for existing schools that want to implement personalized learning practices, as well as train leaders to design and launch innovative new schools. Specifically, Reframe will emphasize innovation around student ownership, use of real-time data, competency-based progression, learning time, staffing, academic content, and physical space. By building a true community of practice, we believe these innovative new schools will lead to higher student academic proficiency and growth, and higher through-college graduation rates (building on early research by RAND as well as other national proof points). Reframe's focus on community-building and talent development will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn as it becomes the next hub for K-12 education innovation.","Reframe Labs will focus on talent development, with the ultimate goal to prepare those leaders to launch new and redesigned schools. When it comes to K-12 education, however, Los Angeles is the most politically-complex urban district in the nation. With a school board looking to stabilize a district still looking for a permanent superintendent, there is a risk that the board may object to and block the launch of new schools. For leaders looking to create new charter schools, this would mean denial of charter authorization from the district, and lead to an appeals process with the L.A. County Board of Education and, if necessary, the California Department of Education. While there may still be a pathway for the launch of charter schools through these appeals, Reframe would increase its work with existing schools seeking to redesign their instructional models. Our strategy would then deemphasize new schools and instead focus on redesigns.","As a talent development pipeline, Reframe will count the number of attendees that graduate from our different programs and use surveys to evaluate our impact. We will also count the number of new and redesigned schools that emerge from our programs. For those leaders who ultimately go through our Redesign and Next Gen Fellowship programs (we aim to be one of the Top 3 professional learning experiences attendees will have ever encountered), we will measure the schools' impact on student learning, from both proficiency and growth perspectives, as measured by state tests (using API, which we believe will be replaced soon with another state measure).","There is no other organization training leaders to design and launch next generation school models in Los Angeles. In other cities across the countries, there are organizations that fund innovative new schools but do not run talent development programs (i.e.: NewSchools Venture Fund, Silicon School Fund, Next Generation Learning Challenges, and Charter School Growth Fund). There are also some organizations starting to focus on innovative teacher training (i.e.: BetterLesson, Relay, Highlander Institute FUSE, and CityBridge) and these are highly complementary and of course needed. Building Excellent Schools (BES) is a respected organization that trains new principals; in many ways, Reframe Labs will be a BES 2.0, training new leaders with an emphasis on new learning practices. 
 
 While Reframe will work with anybody who wants to discuss the future of school, our biggest investments will be on school leaders because they have the most control over instructional decisions at school sites. The Reframe talent development model is designed to be a funnel for surfacing the coalition of the willing--district, charter, or private--and investing more into those who show promise for advancing new and redesigned schools.","Reframe is fortunate to have connections with virtually every other organization nationally focused on next gen learning. When it comes to Reframe's programming in Los Angeles, however, 100% of this grant award will be used internally. None of it will be used to subcontract other partners.","Overhead cost (3 FTEs and operations) is approximately $600,000/year.
 
 Our Programming has four levels: Discover (one day workshops), Spark (two-day bootcamps), Redesign (six-month program), and Next Gen Fellowship (1-year fellowship). Programming costs are variable based on the number of participants. Our Year 1 forecast for each program, respectively: 600, 360, 50, 5. With these assumptions, our Year 1 program costs will be $1,024,500. 
 
 We anticipate covering the additional cost via philanthropy and are in conversations with other funders. We will also explore making certain components fee-for-service. 
 
 A grant from LA2050 and the publicity that will accompany it will not only help launch Reframe's talent development programs but catalyze other funders as well.","A $100,000 grant from LA2050 will go towards hiring one full-time partner who can help shape and facilitate our design programs with educators. This person will ideally be a teacher turned instructional lead and principal, who also has had some consulting experience.","Reframe will make all proprietary content freely accessible to all. Unfortunately, we know from experience that even the best (and priciest) research, white papers, and strategic plans ultimately lie on a shelf collecting dust. What brings those findings to life for the masses are direct coaching experiences. Reframe will engage educators in collaborative school design, applying the latest research and practices. 
 
 As a member of LAUSD's Instructional Technology Initiative (I'm one of five expert resources for the Task Force), I will ensure that Reframe's professional learning opportunities are open to all interested throughout the district. 
 
 I will also diffuse lessons learned through my national network, providing a blueprint for next gen talent development to other regional organizations."

5102089,Turning Effort Into Opportunity Through Saving,2015054,,,"EARN will expand our innovative, online, matched savings program to serve families in Los Angeles. EARN’s program promotes positive financial behavior and develops a lasting habit of saving, which is the first step in achieving financial security and upward mobility. Through saving, individuals can weather financial storms, and invest in their dreams",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,Magnolia Catchment Area,Learn,"EARN’s vision for a healthier Los Angeles begins with building economic self-sufficiency and resiliency. Los Angeles residents face numerous financial challenges due to unstable incomes, poor credit history, and lack of access to savings. Despite their best efforts many families are struggling to get by. 
 
 Research shows that in the event of job loss, working class families have enough cash on-hand to survive just nine days of expenses. Without a savings safety net, nearly half of American households are just one paycheck away from financial disaster. Our research found that nearly 90% of families want to save, but most are not saving and don’t know how to begin. 
 
 EARN’s solution to this problem is to foster a lifelong savings habit that creates financial security and capital for residents of Los Angeles. Saving improves economic resiliency, allowing individuals to weather financial storms and invest in long-term dreams, such as getting an education or buying a home. The Pew Charitable Trust found that regularly saving is one of the three predictors of people achieving mobility out of the bottom 20% of the economy. 
 
 In partnership with the Magnolia Place Community Initiative, EARN will expand our online, matched savings program to provide Los Angeles families with the opportunity to start saving. EARN’s program promotes economic resiliency by teaching and incentivizing people to save and invest in themselves and their families. The program is simple. Clients link their own savings account to our online platform, set a personal savings goal, make deposits, and earn rewards. The program tracks behavior and rewards users for making $20 minimum deposits over consecutive months. 
 
 Our research shows that after program completion, 85% of participants are living within their means and 92% are prepared to handle financial emergencies (compared to only 42% prior to program enrollment). Additionally, 83% of our clients continue to save after incentives end, leading to increased economic opportunities for themselves and their families in the long-term. 
 
 EARN’s online savings program has the potential to be used by all qualified residents of Los Angeles who are making less than 80% of the Area Median Income, which is $68,300 for a family of four. During the grant period we propose to enroll at least 300 households. By 2050, Los Angeles will be a healthier place to live because all residents will have the savings to handle financial volatility.","EARN attributes our previous success to our clients promoting and recommending EARN through their own personal networks (which speaks to the quality of our programs). As EARN expands beyond the San Francisco Bay Area and scales the number of people served by our savings program, our main challenge lies in recruiting new clients. To overcome this obstacle we are actively forming partnerships with Los Angeles based organizations to reach low-income Angelenos. We have already begun working with Magnolia Place Community Initiatives and related organizations to enroll their clients in EARN’s savings program with great success. EARN is also in the process of creating a comprehensive marketing campaign to increase awareness of our organization and to drive program sign-ups.","EARN rigorously evaluates our savings products; over the course of the program we track our client’s financial security and spending and saving behaviors. Our ultimate goal is to improve economic self-sufficiency by helping our clients build savings. Therefore, we also evaluate our work by the impact it has on financial behavior in the long-term. Key indicators we assess are if program users: 
 
 o Demonstrate a regular pattern of saving and reach their savings goals.
 o Continue saving 6 months to a year after the program ends using a.) either a mainstream savings product or b.) an EARN goal-based account. 
 o Show an improvement in psychosocial behavior towards saving. For example: Being more prepared for financial emergencies and reporting more self-efficacy regarding their financial future. 
 
 Our goals are for: 
 o 300 LA households will enroll and deposit at least $20 a month.
 o 85% of participants will complete the program and 70% will consistently reach their monthly deposit goal.","EARN is the only organization in the United States focused on building savings habits via a laddered online approach. Our market research revealed that one of the largest unmet needs for the low-income population was a basic, short-term savings product that focused on cultivating a saving pattern. We found that nearly 90% of families want to save, but most are not saving and don't know how to begin. EARN’s new online savings program was created to fill this gap by reaching underbanked individuals and guiding them through the savings process in order to build short-term savings. 
 
 We set accessible savings goals and program lengths to reach people who have never saved before. Many traditional savings organizations require participants to set aside large sums of money ($1,000+) over several years without making a withdrawal, and the funds saved can only be used for a specific asset. These large savings goals and the long length of the program were barriers for enrollment and scalability, leaving many households underserved. EARN is unique because we work to create a habit of saving, starting with smaller dollar amount for emergencies. Our clients identify the greatest value of the program to be their own changed behavior and attitudes about finance, leading us to believe that they will be able to continue saving for larger goals.","The $100,000 grant award will be utilized by EARN to expand our existing partnership with the Magnolia Place Community Initiative. The initiative brings together over seventy organizations that achieve and sustain community health in the neighborhoods within the five hundred blocks of the Magnolia Catchment Area of Los Angeles. EARN collaborates with several of these organizations including LIFT LA, CABO (Center for Asset Building Opportunities) and JF LA to bring savings to their constituents. 
 
 EARN will use the grant award to enroll an additional 300 Los Angeles households in our savings program. EARN covers the complete cost of the program, which includes full customer service for users, marketing and outreach support, matched monetary rewards, and reporting and evaluation for partner organizations. Meanwhile, partner organizations are responsible for promoting the savings program to their clients. Partnerships are mutually beneficial because EARN reaches more underserved, underbanked households while partner organizations expand the services they deliver.","The total cost of expanding EARN’s saving program to Los Angeles is $300,000. Our project goals are to enroll at least 500 Los Angeles households in 2016 and to translate the program into Spanish. 
 
 EARN has already received $200,000 from the Leonetti O’Connell Family Foundation to serve 200 Los Angeles households and to translate the program into Spanish. The LA2050 grant will support the enrollment of 300 additional households in the program.","2015-16 EARN Budget for LA2050

 Total Expense $100,000","EARN is dedicated to scaling impact through the use of technology. We have brought our savings programs online and are equipped to respond to the unique and varied needs of traditionally underserved individuals anywhere in the nation. The EARN savings program was specifically developed to focus on the transformative habit of saving, while being extremely cost efficient and highly scalable. By leveraging technology and using behavior-based rewards and incentives, our program has the potential to build a habit of saving in thousands of households in the United States. 
 
 The potential market for our savings program is huge. Almost half of Americans (40%) – 126 million people – are living on the edge of financial collapse with almost no savings. EARN intends to reach these individuals through direct marketing and by pursuing strategic partnerships with other organizations to offer EARN’s program to their low-income employees and clients. EARN has already established partnerships with twenty organizations, including four in Los Angeles. We are also pursuing sustainable earned revenue streams for businesses that want to offer the program as a benefit for their low to moderate income workers, allowing EARN to reach even more people. We currently have eight customers providing employees access to the EARN savings program. 
  
 Beyond this, EARN is working to scale the impact that our program can have on people’s lives. We are building out a comprehensive suite of savings products that our clients can use to reach more ambitious savings goals. After successfully saving for emergencies our clients will be able to start saving for their children’s education, a home, or even their own retirement. All new products will be based upon our existing technology infrastructure, powered by Intuit and Amazon Web Services. 
 
 EARN believes that providing the tools to save is one of the most effective ways to ensure resiliency and social-economic opportunity in our communities. We are determined to scale our success to reach people across America."

Fellows are trained as interdisciplinary creative community problem solvers and future civic leaders as they work on projects to strengthen LA neighborhoods. Fellows develop career and community-building skills and networks through projects addressing arts, culture and equitable development, community health, and neighborhood identity.",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,Pilipino Workers Center; Historic Filipinotown; LA County. Elysian Valley; LA County. East Los Angeles Renaissance Academy; East Los Angeles; LA County.,Learn,"Urban Futures Lab creates work that matters. It reimagines Los Angeles’ civic and creative capital by altering how young adults from under-resourced communities of color access opportunities that employ their inventiveness and support their professional aspirations. The Lab provides young adult Fellows with career-building skills that simultaneously strengthen the region through work of social consequence. It prepares Fellows to pursue higher-earning professions that require varied skill sets through direct work on Public Matters projects. Unlike conventional service learning or workforce development programs that focus on “the job, ” the Lab focuses on Fellows’ career arcs. 
 
 Young adults have the financial imperative to work, the desire to pursue meaningful work, but lack outlets, professional networks, or structure. Often, those pursuing higher education don’t have access to paid civic opportunities. Most young adults lack the on-going mentorship and support essential for their educational and professional growth. For those who desire to work in cross-disciplinary fields or create their own jobs, the challenges are even greater. They are even more formidable for young adults from resource-poor LA neighborhoods. 
 
 Through Urban Futures Lab, Public Matters senior staff act as project leaders and mentors, guiding Fellows’ work in LA neighborhoods. Fellows work in project-based teams, interacting with Public Matters’ vast network of multi-sector partners and collaborators. 
 
 Urban Futures Lab Fellows are paid living wages to use creative, visual and critical thinking skills in neighborhood-based projects. Fellows participate in regular expert-led workshops and trainings. Concentrated summer labs and retreats add in-depth learning. Fellows gain career and life skills that include: 
 
 • Project Conceptualization, Design, and Implementation
 • Leadership and Communication
 • Community Engagement and Relationship Building 
 • Public Speaking, Performances and Presentations
 • Mentoring 
 • Creative Skills (including Media Production, Social Marketing + Design)
 • Personal and Community Health
 • Cultural and Economic Development
 
 Anticipated projects include Hidden Hi Fi, an arts and cultural economic development project in Historic Filipinotown; an urban planning and design project with East LA high school students; assisting the LA Kitchen to develop a line of healthy, affordable snacks; and Market Makeovers that address healthy food access.","Urban Futures Lab must overcome the dual pressures of time and money faced by young adults of limited means. Fellows will include college students, recent graduates and part-time students – many trapped in the web of financial aid, overcrowded classes, and family pressures. 
 
 Scheduling is a challenge. Our projects take place across LA. Some Fellows can only travel via public transit. Public Matters’ flexible team-based project model can accommodate both geography and diverse schedules. Whenever possible, Fellows work in their own or nearby communities, addressing aforementioned transportation concerns while strengthening local knowledge and investment in projects. 
 
 To address financial concerns, we will provide Fellows with living wages and sufficient hours to circumvent the need for other, lower-paying, unskilled jobs. Through one-on-one mentoring, senior staff will work with Fellows to design schedules that support their educational and professional goals.","We will evaluate two tracks: Fellows’ learning/career development and Fellows’ impact on LA neighborhoods. 
 
 We will evaluate learning/career development at various points during a Fellows’ tenure through metrics including: contribution to projects; quality of work; partner/client feedback. We will gauge written, verbal and visual communication skills, time management, project implementation and capacity for independent work. Fellows will maintain a portfolio with client references and their own reflections, allowing us to track their progress. 
 
 To assess Public Matters and Fellows’ impact on neighborhoods, we will use evaluation methods that track their contributions as part of Public Matters’ projects. In general, we employ mixed-methods evaluations – quantitative (surveys) and qualitative data (structured interviews and direct observation). Fellows will participate as both subjects and participants in our research, and thereby expand their own research skill set.","Most programs for young adults of color tend to focus on the extremes: advancement opportunities for the “cream of the crop;” safety nets for the most at-risk. Our experience of working with youth of color for 10 years at Public Matters and for decades independently tells us that the talent pool is deeper than currently recognized: the proverbial cream is thicker than thought. There are countless talented, committed, smart and capable young adults of color who are hindered by systemic problems of poor education, poverty and associated health and social stresses. 
 
 Urban Futures Lab is an atypical workforce development program. Most programs, particularly those serving low-income communities of color, focus on a singular vocation. The Lab prepares Fellows for careers at the intersection of arts, business, media, public health, urban planning, and community change, among others. It trains them in hard and soft skills that translate across industries and professions, and prepares them to thrive in a 21st century job market. Young adults today will change jobs with more frequency than their predecessors. The Lab also engrains in Fellows the belief that careers driven by commitment to civics, community, and equity are both viable and accessible. 
 
 The central distinguishing feature of Urban Futures Lab is its Fellowship structure. The Fellowship prioritizes continued learning, collaborative group work, case studies, professional networking and mentoring—beyond just performance of daily work tasks. A key component will be regularly scheduled lunch and career-building workshops that expose Fellows to professionals in their fields of interest. Many of our potential Fellows, particularly those who have been exposed to Public Matters’ interdisciplinary work as high school students, are looking for jobs that don’t fit narrow categorizations. A hybrid urban planning/ public health/community activist only finds their way—whether they come from resources or not—if they have access to the right mentors, networks and guidance. Public Matters will draw on, and build, its vast network of partners and collaborators (large and small institutions and organizations, universities and local businesses) to ensure that Fellows access forward-thinking and inspiring individuals.
 
 Our goal is to equip these young adults with the skills to access professions with higher earning potential, in careers that fully realize their creativity, ambition, and commitment to community.","Public Matters work is predicated on partnerships. As a social enterprise, we also rely on a client-based, earned-income model. The LA2050 award lowers the barriers for entry, and clients’ cost to work with Public Matters and Urban Futures Lab. It also supports the Fellowship component of the Lab. Therefore, partners will receive Public Matters and Fellows’ services but they will not receive direct funds from the LA2050 award. 
 
 Among the partnerships and projects that we anticipate will be part of Fellows’ work and training over the next two years are: 
 
 • Hidden Hi Fi, an arts, culture and equitable development project with the Pilipino Workers Center, Big City Forum and Metro in Historic Filipinotown. Hidden Hi Fi illuminates neighborhood assets through interactive events, tours, and experiences. Fellows lead cultural tours, build relationships with local businesses, develop revenue-sharing models, and create marketing materials for Jeepney tours. Fellows learn business, marketing, public speaking, community history, and community development skills. 
 
 • An urban planning and design project with East LA Renaissance Academy (ELARA). Fellows, likely some past ELARA graduates, will mentor teens and develop leadership, communications, design and planning skills. 
 
 • “B.O.S.S.” (The Bureau Of Super Snacks/ Bocadillos Optimizados Súper Saludables), a program with the LA Kitchen to provide low-cost healthy, nutritious and culturally appropriate snacks on LA’s eastside. Fellows will undertake product planning and development of a healthy snack line, including branding, social marketing, and community outreach and partnership development. Fellows will work directly with local organizations, schools and institutional partners. Additional skills gained will include Food Manager’s certifications and food handling training, product development, healthy eating and nutrition, financial literacy, business development and promotion.
 
 • Market Makeover projects to improve healthy food access. Fellows will lead the physical transformation of existing corner stores; education and community engagement; and social marketing to change health behaviors and increase fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Potential projects include a project in Elysian Valley with River Wild LLC. 
 
 • A partnership with the LA Times Youth site, highschool.latimes.com, will also allow Fellows and community members to contribute media about projects and neighborhoods.","Public Matters’ community projects are financed by a variety of sources, including direct client fees often in conjunction with some form of grant funding. We have a ten-year track record of working on large-scale projects with universities, national organizations like Truth Initiative (formerly Legacy, the largest national tobacco prevention agency, based in Washington DC), and on initiatives like Healthy Eating Active Communities, a California Endowment project. We often are subcontracted and directly written into grant proposals. 
 
 The total cost of Urban Futures Lab, including staff time for Public Matters senior staff and mentors is $235,000. Funding from LA2050 covers the Fellowship program: Fellows’ wages, workshops, lunch-time meet and greets with professionals, project supplies, and Public Matters staff time for mentoring. 
 
 Urban Futures Lab is directly connected to Public Matters’ work, allowing us to match LA2050 funding with earned income. LA2050 award funds are critical, as they underwrite the expenses of a Fellowship program not supported by revenue from client fees; in fact, LA2050 would enable clients and partners to work with Fellows and Public Matters at reduced cost. 
 
 Additional costs for the Lab will be covered by project budgets, whether the sources come directly from clients or from philanthropy. We have already identified and in most cases already secured funding for the projects listed: Community Economic Development Funds and business sponsors for Hidden Hi Fi; Exploring the Arts and likely USC Price School of Public Policy for the work with the East LA Renaissance Academy; Emerging Markets for the Market Makeovers project in the Elysian Valley. While funds have not been directly secured for work with the LA Kitchen, we have strong interest from the Economic and Workforce Development Department. We are confident that the total costs for Urban Futures Lab will be secured.","PERSONNEL

Scaling up means going deeper with projects and relationships, and increasing the level of services and social change we can offer a client, the surrounding community, and Fellows. 
 
 Our first priority is to make sure the Lab meets our Fellows’ needs and aspirations as they grow through the program. As the Lab grows, we will increase the range of projects and locations offered to Fellows. Greater geographic and content diversity will build Fellows’ knowledge and awareness of the region, expanding their networks and skill sets. We will expose Fellows to different neighborhoods, food, cultures, and customs. With growth, we will facilitate field trips and visits to places and groups doing innovative work in LA. 
 
 We also plan to create partnerships with community colleges and business development programs to provide entrepreneurial training and college credit to Fellows. 
 
 We intend to develop partnerships with groups that have the capacity to hire Fellows as they complete their time with the Lab. Groups like PolicyLink have told us that while they recruit from well respected universities, these hires often lack knowledge of how communities function. Fellows hailing from communities served by groups like PolicyLink and savvy in community processes, would be ideal hires. 
 
 Public Matters’ work has a multiplier effect. We have seen this time and again. Our projects strengthen individuals and communities. For example, in Market Makeovers, students learn about healthy eating and nutrition, change their diet, their families’ diet, and help their parents lose weight. Parents become advocates and share the information with friends and relatives. Students lead healthy cooking demonstrations and decide to enter related fields like nutrition, public health, and planning. They plan to return to help their communities. In “The Truth About Flavor,” we worked with South LA high school students to create media about small flavored cigarillos. We built a partnership with the City Attorney’s Tobacco Enforcement Program. Students’ media played a role in the City’s recent decision to enforce greater penalties on tobacco sales to minors and to create a new Responsible Retailer Initiative. Public Matters’ goal is to continue to deepen and improve our engagement with young adults and prepare them for vibrant careers as creative thinkers and civic leaders."

The experience will be available in English and also in Spanish.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Live,"Obesity has become a major public health concern in the United States, and Type-II diabetes is on the rise. It’s a sad fact that nearly 1 in 10 Los Angeles County residents have diabetes, and the total direct cost of treating diabetes is more than $6 billion a year. Diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease and nerve disease. Preventing diabetes requires lifestyle modifications to change the most basic habits-how we eat and how active we are in our free time. Despite efforts of clinicians to educate patients with prediabetes, lifestyle interventions are intensive and community-based, rather than clinical. Our program is evidence-based, and will create a virtual community to overcome “obesogenic” factors that have become the norm in our communities. It’s time to translate the scientific evidence into a wellness movement. Our program will harness smartphone technology to successfully implement a large-scale intensive lifestyle intervention. This intervention translates a proven, community-based structured lifestyle program into an innovative, mobile format. We intend to recruit participants through community health clinics and screenings across the county. We would, however, like to target our efforts at regions of the county particularly impacted by type-II diabetes. This mHealth intervention is titled “Life in Balance: A Mobile Application for Wellness”; in Spanish, this translates into “Vida en Equilibrio: Una Aplicación Móvil Para el Bienestar”.
 
 This program will inform, educate and empower participants through a convenient smartphone app.
 
 The program is based on the CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum, and it will be tailored to adults living in Los Angeles. In order to maximize the potential of our mobile program, the intervention will be available in two formats: English and Spanish. This will enable us to reach a wider audience of adults who may benefit from the program. Los Angeles residents who complete this mobile intervention will experience a 12-month intensive lifestyle intervention. The main objectives are modest weight loss of 5-7% and increased physical activity. The app will include many features that connect participants to the world around them. Each participant will receive a Bluetooth scale that will link directly to the app to record weekly weight, and a smartphone pedometer will assist in recording physical activity.","A major challenge to implementing this lifestyle intervention is participant dropout. Oftentimes, community health interventions experience high attrition rates. This may in part be due to constraints due to family obligations, lack of transportation or conflicting work schedules. By developing a mobile app that can deliver weekly content and link participants to live certified Lifestyle Coaches, participants will be able to experience the app at their own pace, wherever they are. This will also allow us to recruit participants from diverse areas of Los Angeles, and to allow participants to begin the intervention at different times.","The primary evaluation will be conducted with the pilot program prediabetes participants. They will take a survey prior to program commencement to test their knowledge of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. This survey will be redone at the end of the one-year period again to see if there are any improvements in their knowledge. 
 
 A lifestyle survey developed by the Minneapolis American Indian Center (Minneapolis American Indian Center, 2004) will be administered at three, six, nine and twelve month intervals to check on the participants’ progress with the mobile DPP program. 
 
 In addition to the self-reported data, A1C testing will be conducted at baseline and at the same intervals as when the surveys are administered and will be done by staff working at the DPP partners. The A1C testing will determine if the program participants are successfully able to use the mobile DPP platform to reduce their risk.","There are currently organizations that offer chronic disease prevention programs, both in-person and through an online platform. To our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first mobile app to be offered to the citizens of Los Angeles, in English and Spanish, as a completely mobile evidence-based lifestyle intervention. Our approach is also unique in that the content will be tailored to residents of Los Angeles; content will be filmed at various sites throughout Los Angeles County, and will feature guest appearances by prominent residents of Los Angeles.","In order to recruit potential participants, we will need to partner with community health organizations. We estimate that $1000 will go to each partner that is able to assist in recruiting potential participants. We will identify partner organizations based on a survey administered by Polar Tech Ed and Consulting, LLC.","Ideally this app will be completed for around $100,000. We have 30 years of IT experience, and feel confident that the app can get up and running for around $100,000. There may be additional costs involved, and we would like to apply for other grants that focus on chronic disease prevention, such as the National Institute of Health. We will look at other funding sources in the private sector such as health startup incubators and venture capital in addition to traditional public health funding methods.","Platform development costs: $60,433.00

5102058,Volunteer Glendora!,2015033,,,"The City of Glendora offers a variety of opportunities to its residents as well as those of surrounding communities, to volunteer within our parks, facilities and wilderness areas. The City would like to increase its volunteer programs in our Trails and Wilderness areas as well as individual projects by investing in an enclosed mobile tool trailer that would house various equipment needed for volunteer projects throughout the City. It is the goal of the City to get the community excited about",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,City of Glendora,Learn,"Glendora believes that volunteering plays a great role in creating a tight knit and socially aware community. Volunteering is a great way to meet new people, learn a new skill, help others, and relieve physical and mental stress. It is said that those who volunteer have a higher change of finding a job after being out of work than those who do not volunteer and that those who volunteer are more likely to participate in other civic engagements. Volunteering also leaves a positive impression on our youth as it is said that those who volunteer in their youth are twice as likely to volunteer later in life as adults. 
 Glendora has orchestrated many volunteering opportunities such as our Adopt-A-Park program that allows groups or individuals to clean up a park, donate a needed amenity such as a bench or drinking fountain, or even plant a tree. We have also orchestrated a community build day through a grant from Kaboom! that brought hundreds of community members together to complete the construction of a new playground for our Gladstone Park. 
 In addition to these opportunities, the City also works with the local Trails Volunteers to organize Trails Days where boy scouts, girl scouts and other community members come out to clean up the trails within our wilderness areas. 
 The City's Parks Division has always done a great job in making sure that all of the tools for the job are available for each volunteering opportunity. This often means that tools from their own day-to-day operations are provided for volunteers to use, however many times there are not enough to go around. The City would like to be able to expand upon its current volunteer opportunities and in order to do so would like to purchase an enclosed trailer, fill it up with tools needed for volunteering and dedicate this trailer to the Volunteer Glendora! program. The City would like to market this trailer as an easy all in one accessible option for volunteer groups, such as scout troops and other community organizations. With this program we hope to really push our community to volunteer more, which we believe will create lasting connections between people as well as connections to nature within our wilderness areas and Glendora's rich culture.
 
 This program will also coincide with our Healthy Glendora Program, which promotes healthy lifestyles, both mentally and physically. We believe in the connection between nature and health is extremely important.","One of our anticipated challenges will be to create a policy that dictates how the mobile tool trailer will be used within the community. Policies such as who utilizes the mobile tool trailer, where they can use it and for how long they can use it will be carefully considered to make sure that our program is as effective as possible. Another challenge is getting the word out that the trailer is available for use. To overcome this obstacle we will work with our social team to develop a positive eye catching campaign that reaches all ages within our community.",The City will keep track of how many groups or individuals reserve and utilize the mobile tool shed and what type of work they intend to complete with the use of the tool shed. We hope to increase the amount of volunteering requests by providing a ready to go trailer with all of the essentials. We will use our social media platforms to market the program to our community and will keep track of how groups hear about the mobile tool shed to make sure that our media outlets are reaching our target audience.,"The Trails Volunteers currently have a small shed with small tools in it. It is not portable and contains a minimal amount of equipment. This mobile tool trailer would complement their volunteer efforts and actually help them to do additional work. 
 
 We believe this program is unique in that it will provide both the tools and a visual component to encourage our volunteers to enjoy their experience. By supplying all the tools necessary in a mobile trailer wrapped with positive images and designs we remove the difficulty of brining supplies to the day of event and create a fun atmosphere.","At this time, the City will be the primary entity working on this project. The Glendora Trail Volunteers will be working closely with the City, but will not receive any direct funds.","It will cost approximately $50,000 to implement this project in its entirety. We do not anticipate this project going over $100,000.","It will cost approximately $50,000 to implement this project in its entirety.

5102154,Vote for civic-minded students and college success!,2015100,,,"JSA will partner with Alliance College-Ready Public Schools to provide a civic leadership program that prepares low-income students to become engaged citizens and successful students into and through college. This proposal will create six new JSA chapters at Alliance schools, which are uniquely suited to host the organization because of 1) their mission to empower LA’s underserved students for college and career success, and 2) their focus on student-led project-based learning.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,Learn,"For over a decade, Alliance has proven that exceptional can become the rule for public schools. Committed to increasing access to a high-quality, college preparatory education for Los Angeles’ most vulnerable communities, Alliance educates almost 12,000 students (94% low-income and 99% Latino or African-American). The results have been dramatic-91% of students graduate high school in four years and 95% are accepted to college. The challenge faced by Alliance students though, similar to other low-income students of color across the nation, is persisting through and graduating from college. By expanding the JSA footprint to six new Alliance high schools, we can help the network address this challenge. JSA’s unique student-led programming builds the advocacy, leadership, resilience, academic and social skills that will prepare Alliance’s students for future success. 
 
 The partnership will bring JSA’s three-pronged model to six new schools:
 
 1) School-sponsored extracurricular clubs that meet weekly to plan candidate forums, political fairs, debates, voter registration drives, and community service projects. 
 
 2) Overnight conventions and 1-day regional conferences that bring together students from across Southern California, with student-led debate and a Congressional simulation.
 
 3) 3-4 week Summer School academic programs offering a college-level curriculum.
 
 To drive expansion, we will hire a Fellow to train students and teachers to offer JSA in Alliance schools, we will subsidize the participation of Alliance students in regional events so that they can become leaders and liaisons to their home campuses, and we will host an Alliance forum at City Hall where students can meet civic leaders and discuss and debate issues identified by students. 
 
 Alliance students will also develop a cross-school activism project. Designed by participating students, it will focus on youth issues in the 2016 elections, increasing voter turnout city-wide, or creating safer, cleaner communities. 
 
 These activities are well-suited for incorporation into the Alliance model. Alliance believes that interdisciplinary real-world projects are essential, and that high expectations become self-fulfilling. JSA’s activities incorporate leading civic and political thinkers and doers as well as issues ripped from the headlines, and they assume the students not only can but must take the lead.","A challenge we anticipate is the need to help parents and students understand what JSA is and what it does for a student, and what their roles are in participation. This is always a challenge for JSA in expansion, and it is compounded in working with Alliance because of language barriers and other factors common to students from marginalized communities. 
 
 A person-to-person approach is an important tool for addressing this challenge. We will hire a Chapter Development Fellow who is a JSA alum and current college student or recent graduate. The Fellow will work directly with students and families, answering their questions, guiding them through the forms and other processes that are a part of participation, and connecting them to currently participating students who can vouch for the impact that the program can make on a student’s life. The Fellow will also make presentations on campuses and train teachers on how to support students in developing their JSA on their campuses.","Over the grant period, we intend to track the following outcomes:
 1. Reach, as measured by the number of students participating in each JSA chapter and in network-wide events.
 2. Impact on each student, as measured by self-reported changes in key skills such as communication, research and analysis, and leadership capacity.
 3. Impact on school-wide culture, as measured by the number of events that extend beyond the chapter.
 4. Impact of the Alliance partnership on JSA work, as measured by Alliance students obtaining leadership positions within the JSA Southern California state.
 
 In the longer-term, we intend to further clarify impact by comparing indicators such as academic outcomes, matriculation rates, and college completion rates for JSA-participating students with non-participating students, and by comparing JSA-participating Alliance schools with Alliance schools that are not participating.","JSA is one of several major U.S.-based civic education organizations, including Mikva Challenge and Generation Citizen (though JSA is the most active of these in Southern California). The primary difference between JSA and its peers is that it is student-run and student-led, with high schoolers developing the programming that takes place on their home campuses, as well as coordinating the set of conferences that bring students together regionally. Professional staff mentor, support, and guide the students, but ultimately the organization belongs to students and reflects their priorities. The student-led nature of the work is core to what JSA does—it creates opportunities to not only learn about but substantively practice leadership, it reflects the organization’s democratic principles, and it is the mechanism by which much of the skills development that prepares students for college occurs.
 
 Alliance College-Ready Public Schools is the largest charter network in L.A., but it does have many peers, including KIPP, Aspire, and Green Dot. What sets Alliance apart is our success at scale and sustainable expansion of our schools to serve increasing numbers of students every year. We are also on the leading edge of innovation, using technology as a tool to increase academic rigor, personalize instruction, and build student ownership of learning. Alliance is uniquely suited for this partnership because of the emphasis that its schools place on extended project-based learning with real world implications. Founding and running a JSA chapter is a year-long endeavor, requiring continued collaboration, and debates, speakers, and other programming are tied directly to the issues of the day. Nothing about JSA is theoretical—it is a practical exercise in peer engagement, planning, research, and analysis.","Alliance College-Ready Public Schools is JSA’s partner. The two organizations have been creating a partnership over the course of the past three years, and this project represents its next logical development. JSA would be the primary grantee, and would provide Alliance with $40,500 in chapter development fund ($6,750 per school at six schools) for use according to a personalized strategy developed by each school’s principal and teachers, with input from JSA staff.
 
 JSA is a critical partner to Alliance because program offerings reflect best practices in preparing low-income students, like those served by Alliance, for college. In Redefining College Readiness, David T. Conley presents the assets that these students must develop to thrive in college, many of which are essential elements of the JSA experience. These include:
 
 1. Ability to work with a group on an assignment that extends over a period of time: Student-run and student-led is the founding principle of JSA, requiring deep and ongoing collaboration. 
 2. Reasoning, argumentation, proof, and analysis: JSA debate challenges students to back up opinions through rigorous evidence, and students are forced to evaluate the credibility of sources and perspectives.
 3. Intellectual openness: Students in JSA are exposed to civil and respectful arguments from across the political spectrum. 
 4. Research: Debate rewards careful preparation—it requires an understanding not only of the facts that support your own arguments, but also of the facts that support opposing arguments. 
 5. Contextual skills and awareness/“college knowledge”: Participants in Summer School spend three to four weeks on the campus of an elite university gaining exposure to the college lifestyle of independence and high academic expectations.
 6. “The ability to interact with (people) who come from different backgrounds and hold points of view different from the student’s”: JSA expands students' networks and treats diverse students as equally important.
 
 In addition to increasing college readiness, JSA activities sync with the need to meet Common Core, particularly related to language arts. According to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, “The (Common Core) reading standards focus on students’ ability to read carefully and grasp information, arguments, ideas, and details based on evidence in the text.” The JSA model of learning and debating about the issues of the day fits firmly into this description.","We anticipate the project will cost $100,000.","Chapter Development Fellow: $25/hour x 15 hours per week x 40 weeks = $15,000
 
 School Chapter Development Fund: 6 schools x $6,750 = $40,500
 
 Regional Conferences: 6 schools x 50 students per school x $115 in room and food subsidies total over three events = $34,500
 
 City Hall Event: $10,000 
 
 Total: $100,000","College success and persistence is one of biggest challenges facing schools serving students from low-income backgrounds. Though college acceptance and attendance rates are increasing dramatically among these students, less than 10% of low-income students actually complete a degree.
 
 The JSA-Alliance partnership addresses this need. As discussed in the Redefining College Readiness report, the issues around college persistence are rarely academic—Alliance and its peers have developed a model that gives students the in-class skills they need, as reflected in increasing graduation rates and test scores. What these schools need from JSA is a partner in helping their students develop resilience, social capital, self-advocacy, and other factors that come from practicing leadership.
 
 JSA currently operates in 10 Alliance schools, reaching 500 participating students. In the coming year, we will expand JSA to six new Alliance high schools and increase student participation by 300 students. As part of the design process, JSA chapters will ensure participation among all grade levels (9-12) to ensure the systems and infrastructure built for the program in the first year are carried on by students in subsequent years. The partnership will also develop a prototype for effective and rapid expansion of the JSA model into all all 17 Alliance high schools which will engage up to 35000 low-income students. As the partnership is formalized and evaluation shows its impact, we can explore partnerships with the other major charter networks and with school districts (like JSA’s partnership with Compton Unified School District) that would allow us to scale up further. 
 
 Because each Alliance principal has wide discretion in terms of how to use the School Chapter Development Fund on their campuses, we will have a variety of expansion models to compare in terms of ROI, and we can turn the most effective models into curriculum that we share with other schools.
 
 JSA currently reaches 10,000 students across the country, but Alliance-type partnerships offer an opportunity to dramatically increase this number."

We Are Ready Are You?,2015005,,,"After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles wants to support our youth as they move through the toughest transition, middle school to high school, and make life-changing decisions that will determine their paths in high school and beyond. We want to continue to mentor our students in their high school years and provide them an opportunity to also mentor the future and make a difference. Through this program, students will become successful and active community members in the city of Los Angeles.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,None,"There is an education alarm bell ringing! Across Los Angeles, there is a major high school drop out crisis and After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles is here to respond. 
 According to estimates released by the Ad Council, 7,000 high school students drop out of school every day. Without a high school diploma, these children face huge socioeconomic challenges, including above-average unemployment rates, below-average wages, and an increased likelihood of serving time in prison. 
 Our nation’s staggering dropout crisis most significantly affects minority students, with nearly 50% of Black, Latino, and Native Americans in public schools failing to graduate. ASAS-LA population of students are 91% Latino and 8% African American. Our students are most at risk of abandoning their education before receiving a high school diploma. 
 After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles will combat this crisis by mentoring students in three ways:
 1. We Are Ready (W.A.R.) - We Are Ready is a middle school to high school transition program. ASAS-LA identifies and engages eighth graders who show signs they are at risk of dropping out, such as poor attendance, behavior issues, and low grades. The primary goal is to maximize the number of students who are promoted to the ninth grade, graduate high school and attend college. 
 2. CampUs - Students who have completed the W.A.R. curriculum will have the opportunity to apply for and attend CampUs. CampUs is a summer program on college campuses that focuses on preparing rising ninth graders for high school and beyond. Students sleep in college dorms and take daily classes on how to be successful in high school, college, and the workforce. They are mentored by ASAS-LA staff and by successful high school and college students. Students attend nightly career panels, comprised of community leaders. Students examine critical issues affecting their communities, engage in debate, and develop their leadership and advocacy skills. 
 3. Leaders Influence Family and Education- Students will attend Alumni Reunion Summits once a month. These summits will include topics such as high school plans, scholarships, life skills, entrepreneurship, college visits and assistance with college applications. Students will also receive on-the-job training where they will be paired with a Program Leader for 6-8 weeks. Upon graduation from high school and successful completion of L.I.F.E., students will be invited to become Program Leaders within the organization.",One major barrier that we foresee is that students become really busy once they enter high school. It may be difficult for the students to attend the proposed summits. We will overcome this by offering the summit on the weekends and multiple times throughout the month. This will make it more accessible to the students.,"Our work will be evaluated on numerous levels. After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles works with a third party evaluator, Claremont Graduate School, to assess W.A.R. and CampUs program impact, and together with school district data, measures impact in areas such as academic performance and social-emotional development. Program impact is assessed through a series of pre and post surveys completed by students and mentors. We will also track attendance and consistency through Youth Services database. Claremont Graduate School will also collect Fall and Spring grades from each student, complete ongoing observations of the program as well as receive counselor tracking documents to ensure students will graduate.","The middle school to high school transition piece is a hot topic in education right now. There are definitely other organizations that are trying to accomplish the same goal. There are several differences in our approach. First, we serve a large population of students throughout the city of Los Angeles. The program will reach all of these students. Second, our program component, CampUs, allows students to take part in a week-long experience on a college campus and it's completely free of charge. Third, we will continue to follow these students and provide support as they continue through high school.","Wells Fargo- $0

The program stresses individual attention and support and requires a 2-day per week, 7-week commitment to creating a healthier lifestyle. The two main elements of this program are Walking and Changing Unhealthy Habits.",1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,,0Create0Live,"Although Americans in all income brackets report better emotional health when they exercise and eat fruits and vegetables regularly, low-income Americans experience an even bigger emotional boost from practicing these good health habits than those with higher income levels. More than half of LA County’s adult population is overweight or obese. Statistics show that residents from low-income areas in LA are at higher risk for preventable diseases that are linked to obesity.
 
 This program is for low-income people who have:
 • Limited resources & lack access to healthy, affordable foods
 • Fewer opportunities for physical activity
 • High stress levels
 • Limited access to health care
 
 This program is for people who suffer from chronic conditions, including but not limited to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, in which a lack of exercise and other factors contribute to the originating problem.
 
 Research has shown that taking time for fitness is a habit that triggers widespread change. Exercise is a Keystone Habit (more important than other habits) that unlocks the secret of well-being by changing the mental image we have of ourselves. People start thinking of themselves as a person who exercises and has self-discipline. When people exercise, they start eating better and procrastinating less. They start changing other habits unconsciously, become more productive at work, and have less stress.
 
 The two main focuses of this program are Walking and Changing Unhealthy Habits, inspired by the book, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg.
 
 Course Work:
 Introduction to the value of exercise
 Positive effects of exercise on physical & mental well-being
 Understanding how habits work
 Keystone Habits

 • Cue
 • Routine
 • Reward

 • Experiment with rewards
 • Isolate the cue
 • Have a plan
 Learn to replace unhealthy habits with healthy habits
 
 Support Group Sharing:
 • Week-to-week progress
 • Goals
 • Stories
 • Areas of difficulty
 • Successes
 • Frustrations
 • Problem solving
 • Questions & answers

 Monthly Group Follow-Up Meetings:
 For the first 4 months after program completion, participants will continue to meet once a month for ongoing support & personal tune-ups.","It has been shown that about half way through habit change programs, especially ones designed to impact exercise and nutrition, people may start feeling insecure about their progress and like they might fail. They feel like they don’t deserve success. I will encourage an open dialogue. I will address any and all insecurities within the group on a regular basis throughout the program and give extra individual support to anyone needing it. I will identify such experiences as natural components of habit change and help participants to recognize both that they deserve to succeed and will describe the many reasons why that is.","The effectiveness of the program on participants’ overall health and well-being will be measured using objective and subjective data. There will be a third party Registered Nurse to track and keep reports on individual progress.

 • Energy Level","The American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, the Center for Managing Chronic Disease, and The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health all have toolkits for walking programs. They are self-motivated guides for a solo-walking program. In addition, there are many non-profits in Los Angeles that help with nutrition, as well as exercise, yoga, and zumba classes. Schools such as UCLA offer one-time lectures on the importance of exercise to one’s health.
 
 What makes this Walking to Wellness program unique is that it utilizes interactive learning in combination with shared experiences in a safe and supportive environment. In my experience as a walking coach, simply suggesting to people that they begin to walk on their own rarely yields behavior change. But being there to walk with them, to talk with them and to encourage them along the way, until walking becomes a habit, provides just the supportive environment needed to effect that desired change. This program includes facilitator-led group walks, individual walking, motivational support from within the group and individually, and positive reinforcement from the facilitator between meetings. We don’t just talk, we “Walk the walk!”","I have volunteered with Groceryships, a wonderful organization whose mission is very much in alignment with the goals of this program. Groceryships can refer their program participants and alumni to the Walking to Wellness Program as a complementary way for those participants to continue their journey towards health. As such, I would like to list Groceryships as a collaboration partner and will share the balance of the funds of approximately $43,000 with them.","Estimated budget for one year: $56,668 (12 Groups)","ANNUAL PROGRAM BUDGET

5102342,Watts Ball: A Fun New Playground Sport for Kids and Cops to Play Together,2015226,,,A new alt sport played by kids and cops together. Each team contains young people and cadets from the police academy. Playing together builds a relationship to transform neighborhoods.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Watts Towers,Play,"With all the bad news in recent years about violence and strife between police officers and residents of poor or predominantly black neighborhoods, it's clear that change is needed. Though bodycams, accountability, and better communication are important, there are no quick fixes. It's said in a proverb that the best time to plant an apple tree is 20 years ago and the second best time is now. What if we could plant seeds now that would transform the way police officers interacted with residents in South LA for generations to come? What if, using play and community building, we could build the foundation for a better relationship between cops and the citizens they protect, starting right now?
 
 WATTS BALL is a new playground game or alt sport. Each team consists of Blockers and Strikers, and the object of the game is to get the ball in your team's goal. However, there are two things that makes this game very different: it is played around Watts Towers, and every team is made of an equal split of kids and cadets from the police academy.
 
 For the cadets, playing with the kids will give them a new perspective on who exactly is in the community they're protecting, and what's at stake. For the kids, playing with the cadets will help them build trust and combat preconceived notions about the role of police in their neighborhood. For years to come, the players will remember their shared team experiences, victories, and challenges, and the spirit of good sportsmanship and team play will be a welcome new kind of interaction between these two populations that, historically, have been all too often connected only in tragic situations.
 
 The added benefit of this proposal is that the game is played at Watts Towers to revitalize this LA landmark that is in peril of neglect and underfunding.
 
 Once neighborhood and regional leagues are established and tournament play becomes regularized - culminating in a first-ever championship Watts Ball team! - we can spread the rules and practices of the game to other communities throughout LA and beyond, but it will always be heralded as a true Los Angeles original, like Hollywood and Fortune Cookies.","It's hard to get people excited about a new game; most people, kids and adults, are more likely to play a game they already know. We hope to apply our experience and expertise as professional game designers and reality TV challenge creators to design a new playground sport that kids and cops will both want to try and test their competitive spirit. Furthermore, we hope to attract participants with spiffy team jerseys, a party-like atmosphere at the competitions, and exciting prizes for winning teams.","We'll play test the game with our network of seasoned new-game enthusiasts. We'll debrief with the kid players and their families as well as the cadets via in-person interviews and anonymized reports to find out what we could do to make playing the game and participating in a team more appealing. But make no mistake, we want to build something that will last a long time and change the city in a meaningful way for good, so we want to always have an eye on the long-term success of the project: 5, 10, 15 years down the line. So getting feedback from the players is critical, but we must always remember that in the olden days, baseball was played without a glove and never at night. Sports change over time. Watts Ball will change too.","The Police Athletic League (P.A.L.) is probably the organization that mostly closely resembles the end result we're trying to achieve. However it seems the LA branch of PAL is somewhat neglected; in fact, if you go to the web site and call the numbers associated with the different regions, not one of them is still a valid number. It's understandable that this arm of the police department is not the most robust currently. We hope to infuse some new resources and energy, tracking down the officers who have experience with such matters, and apply what they know to help make this project a success.
 
 We co-founded Play Folk here in Los Angeles, a club dedicated to playing rare and unusual games. In Brooklyn, the ""alt sport"" (alternative sport) Circle Rules Football is probably the closest analogue, and it is still enjoyed in league play to this day. There are other communities throughout the US and Europe dedicated to playing alternative games, but none that are using a new, site-specific game specifically to strengthen community ties between cops and kids.",None now,100000,"Web site

5102107,Watts Rain Gardens,2015069,,,"The Watts Rain Gardens project is a multi-benefit environmental and revitalization project that will create 10000 sq ft of pervious surface that will not only capture stormwater before it enters the ocean and provide much needed tree shade, but will create beautiful green parkways in Watts.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Play,"The Watts Rain Gardens project is a multi-benefit environmental and revitalization project that will create 10000 sq ft of pervious surface that will not only capture stormwater before it enters the ocean and provide much needed tree shade in a low-income neighborhood, but will help create an attractive, green parkway in in Watts. Currently the site is comprised of blighted parkways on 103rd and Kalima Streets in park-poor Watts. The project will feature over 500 native plants, 25 trees and over 10000 sq ft of rain garden catchment system along 4 blocks in Watts. 
 
 The Watts Rain Gardens is a multibenefit project that will not create immediate change in the visual character of the neighborhood, but combined with other efforts on 103rd, will be a catalyst for change with a measureable impact on the environment. 
 
 It is difficult, even discouraging, to walk down the street when the parkways are full of debris, old couches, shopping carts and other similar items. These items commonly pepper urban, low income neighborhoods. FLTS does not see it as a matter of self destruction, but of one of long term disinvestment. At some point, when a community feels left on the fringes, a collective consciousness begins to take over. One of neglect and disillusionment. And the built environment has a great impact on one’s psyche. Watts has one of the lowest greenspace ratios in the City of Los Angeles and the County. 
 
 Now imagine, if we took the time to invest in the community, engage community around creating tangible, immediate change in their neighborhoods; discussing collectively the impacts of creating even the slightest bit of greenspace in communities that are parkpoor, tree-less, and without any type of greenspace. And on top of creating additional greenspace, the project also would help the environment by capturing stormwater and proving a much needed tree canopy. The Watts Rain Gardens will do just that. It will create swift, cost effective gardens along parkways that will capture rain water, filter it to the water table below, increasing local water supplies AND simultaneously improve the visual character of the neighborhood, with the community, not for them.","When we work with low income communities of color, the most difficult piece is building trust. 
 Many times people felt their communities were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. Long term disinvestment creates fear and distrust in individuals and it is challenging to build a working relationship with community members at first. 
 How we approach this challenge is to invest time in this community. Time to listen, to interact and build a working relationship. FLTS prides itself in investing the needed time, sometimes one-on-one time with community members to empower them to create change in their neighborhoods. Creating authentic community engagement strategies like these are absolutely necessary to build relationships in the communities we work in. 
 Another way we build trust is to authentically engage community members in the projects we work on. This means community members provide their ideas, their input and most importantly their time to invest in their community.","Socially, we believe that removing blight cause by neglected parkways and subsequently revitalizing them through greening will essentially pave the way for more change in the neighborhood. Baseline surveys will be conducted with residents who live directly adjacent and students who utilizes sidewalks and walkways. Surveys will capture attitudes towards the built environment in their neighborhood and feelings around current conditions of the blighted parkways. 
 From an environmental perspective, FLTS is committed to ensure our projects not only look good, but make an actual impact in the community. From an environmental perspective, we take baseline assessments of existing conditions. For this project we will measure tree shade, gallons of storm water runoff and flora and fauna conditions. Post construction, we will measure sq. ft. of shade canopy created, number of stormwater captured and numbers of new insect and animal species.","There are several organizations who build greenspaces – parks, gardens, parkways – in the Los Angeles area. Our proposal is not innovative in that we are not the first group to build rain gardens on parkways. However, what makes our proposal unique is our unwavering commitment to build these projects WITH the community to ensure their investment in the spaces but most importantly empower them. In addition, it is our position that investing in the urban natural environment - particularly investing in greening projects - in disadvantaged communities is as impactful as constructing new buildings, or new retail developments. These types of development projects are absolutely necessary in revitalizing a community however investing in tree canopies, raingardens, parks, and general greenspace projects are as important in order to create healthy, sustainable, livable communities for all.","The project is a collaboration between FLTS, students at Jordan High School in Watts, Office of Councilman Joe Buscaino and the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Street Services. 
 This collaborative project will be a model project to be implemented by other organizations and residents who wish to do their part to help in water conservation and climate change. Students from Jordan High School will work collaboratively with From Lot to Spot to actively engage the community in design workshops that will demonstrate the the importance of the project and how they can implement it in their own homes or parkways. The Bureau of Street Services will work with FLTS to approve and provide guidance in adhering to their “Residential Parkway Landscape” Program to ensure we are adhering to the most environmental standards. FLTS has completed several rain garden projects in the last two years and this project will be a continuation of our work to create beautiful and sustainable rain gardens in communities that lack greenspace.

 We’re creating an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, doers, movers shakers, and business makers, and we’re currently stimulating the economy in Downtown LA by supporting the growth of startup companies, and ultimately creating jobs. 
 
 GRID110 supports early stage businesses and innovative new companies by providing a free workspace, mentoring and access to resources. It’s our aim that startups participating in our program will be able to scale with a stable trajectory, thus stimulating economic development in LA. 
 
 We launched our first community space this summer, with a focus on downtown and fashion tech, and we plan to open spaces in other neighborhoods and industries in the near future. 
 
 Currently there are 5 startups in our pilot program, and it's our goal that they will be able to afford their own office space, and will expand their team after receiving mentorship, and access to resources. 
 
 How will the community benefit?
 
 We’re providing complementary workspace to viable companies. The 5 startups we selected for our inaugural program are the first of many companies that will participate in our programming. Cutting out the overhead cost of office space allows companies to put their money into other parts of their business. 
 
 While our first space is focused on fashion companies, our second space may focus on growing health startups in Boyle Heights, or entertainment in Hollywood, and we plan to have multiple Grid110 spaces focused on various industries over the next few years.
 
 Mentorship is key in building a successful business. Our program connects startups to the experts they need right when they need them, whether it's legal, financial, or HR advice, we give them the people and tools they need to grow.
 
 Access to capital is another important piece of growing a business. We will host a Demo day in January and at the end of each program cycle to connect the community to biggest startup investors in LA. 
 
 Creating jobs and keeping talent in LA will be a hugely important byproduct of our programing, and major part of why we’re doing what we’re doing. If the best new companies exist here, and can hire, why wouldn't the talent stay?!
 
 We also plan on hosting public events to help build the overall local startup community and to serve as platform to support all business development and growth.","Our biggest challenge is accommodating every new business in LA. We don’t have the capacity, or resources to help EVERY new company one-on-one. 
 
 For our first program cycle, we created an application process and chose an industry focus relevant to downtown, but we we're only able to accommodate 5 startups in house.
 
 Alongside our partners, advisors and the community, we’ll choose the next best space and vertical to further support startup growth in LA.
 
 We’ll strive to put on community events with our partners to serve as many people as possible, and will even explore the concept of building and online community platform to support everyone starting a business in LA.","We’re currently bringing together a team to help determine our metrics, and how to measure and evaluate our impact. We’re in the process of contacting companies, universities, orgs and researchers to help us determine the best metrics to measure our work. Over the next 6 months, we plan to develop an evaluation strategy in collaboration with experts.","There are many other incubators and accelerators in the area, but most of them take equity in their companies. GRID110 is a public benefit cooperation that provides free office space, mentoring and resources without taking equity. 
 
 The other differentiator is that we were started by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs. We’re a team solving problems that we we’re all facing. 
 
 We're a team of community builders dedicated to better connecting LA.","Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Office is our biggest partner (but not a fiscal sponsor) and has opened several doors for us in the way of connecting us with key stakeholders and relevant members of the community.
 
 Brookfield is currently our largest community sponsor. They own 47% of the buildings on Bunker Hill, and are taking an active interest in supporting the growing ecosystem of startups.
 
 The legal firm Nixon Peabody is also invested in helping Grid110 succeed. They have been providing legal mentorship and consultation to our community.
 
 Various other local businesses have expressed interest in supporting our community programming.
 
 All of the funding from LA2050 will go directly towards Grid110's efforts.","To operate one space costs around 100-150K per year, which covers basic overhead for the space, internet and electricity. 
 
 Many of these items we we're able to find funding for, or secured in-kind donations to help operate our first space.
 
 We know this endeavor will cost us more than $100k as we open more spaces, but 100K will help us get our second space up and running and further support us in building a community platform to connect what's being created in Los Angeles.
 
 At the moment the Grid110 founders and board of directors are volunteering their personal time in lieu of being able to hire a program manager. Hiring a program manager to coordinate mentors, and oversee the day-to-day will be vital to our growth and success. With a program manager we’ll be able to offer more events, and opportunities to further support the growing startup ecosystem in LA.
 
 As we grow we will continue to actively seek out partners, and have had much success in building relations with key members of the community.
 
 We are also currently exploring multiple sustainability and revenue models to further fund our efforts as we grow.","Our current monthly expenses are as follows:
 
 Building/Office $13,000 +
 (Rent, Keys/Key Cards, Insurance, Furniture, Kitchen Supplies, Office Supplies)
 
 Technology Services $1,000 +
 Email, Internet, Website Hosting, Equipment
 
 Programming/Events $0-200+
 (Mentor Lunches, Advisor Dinners, Community Events )
 
 Marketing/PR $0

 Community programming and resource development $20,000
 Staff to manage community programming and efforts $35,000
 Seed funds towards general operating costs of opening space #2 and #3. $45,000
 
 
 
 If we receive the LA2050 funding we are happy to explore inviting the LA2050 community to vote on which industry our next space should focus on. This could be anything from health startups, to entertainment companies, to maybe even supporting innovative and new restaurants or brick and mortar shops in LA. We'd love to involve the community in helping us make the decision.","The overarching aim at the moment is to activate the ecosystem, promote DTLA as a startup hub, and fill gaps in the business development pipeline.
 
 As we continue to expand, we believe we can be the driving force to connect the dots on the entire LA startup ecosystem. 
 
 Through providing mentorship and resources to our current five startup companies with in our pilot program, they are receiving the support and connections necessary to position them for venture funding, or revenue growth, and thus job creation.
 
 With each space we open, we'll be able to help more and more startups on-on-one. We'll continue to curate each advisory board relevant to the industry focus, and continue to grow organically through building sub-communities within each vertical and by providing relevant public programming.
 
 For us, our partners, and our startups this effort has been a win-win-win.
 
 Hiring staff for Grid110 will be vital in order for us to grow beyond our first space and continue to scale in growing the starting ecosystem."

These courses are free of charge for our students. Once our students complete our training program, they then take the American Welding Society test. In our five year history all 150 students have passed this test. Once our students have passed the AWS exam, we help to place them in jobs.
 
 The Department of Labor says there is a shortage of 300,000 welders in the US and this statistic will continue to grow into the future. 
 
 The end of term project is welding together a motorcycle ambulance. Wheels of Hope LA then sends these ambulances to Angola, Uganda or Congo. The ambulances save lives on a weekly basis in Africa. 
 
 It is a huge paradigm switch for a former gang member or ex-convict to get certified as a welder, make an ambulance that is saving lives in Africa and get a job.","Our biggest challenge and opportunity is our students. Our students in the past have been in rival gangs, have tracking beacons on their ankle so their parole officer knows where they are as well as have a mix of latino, black and white students. At first everyone feels very uncomfortable because our society is quite divided.
 
 Wheels of Hope LA has over come this challenge by having a low teacher to student ratio. The teachers see their role as mentors as much as welding instructors. The instructors are able to keep the focus on welding and not on the other stuff that goes on outside the classroom. 
 
 Our instructors have decades of experience to share and our assistant instructors are former students. Our former students can connect and often communicate better to students.","On the surface, the easiest way to measure success is counting the amount of students we train, get certified through the AWS and place in jobs. We have had incredible success, especially when considering our students' past. 
 
 At the end of each term we invite the families to our school so they can see the ambulances their parents built as well as see them in action. It is always a incredible feeling to know that these children will now be able to be provided for because their parents have a career.","We are a department of Fred Jordan Mission.

Over the course of 8 weeks next summer, they will engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is improving lives.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Learn,"The Los Angeles Promise Zone initiative led by the Mayor’s office tests innovative ideas for neighborhood revitalization. We connect sectors that typically work in silos, including education, housing, safety, economic development, and civic engagement. As such, it is the perfect vehicle to make LA the best place to connect. How? By engaging neighborhood youth as “Young Ethnographers” trained in civic engagement, community research and social justice. The Promise Zone Young Ethnographers will have leadership roles in connecting their neighbors, peers, and families with city government, while helping local government become more responsive to community hopes, dreams, and needs. 
 
 The Los Angeles Promise Zone (LAPZ) in Central Los Angeles is rich in cultural assets, but faces challenges related to urban poverty. Promise Zone communities include Hollywood, East Hollywood, Thai Town, Little Armenia, Koreatown and Pico Union/Westlake. 35% of LAPZ residents live in poverty, so these neighborhoods face related challenges like low educational attainment and high crime. At the same time, they offer a wealth of culture and history, with residents eager to contribute to their community’s transformation.
 
 The LAPZ will make LA the best place to connect by providing Promise Zone youth with a summer job as Young Ethnographers to engage their neighbors in an assessment of quality of life to guide decision-making within local government and measure how the Promise Zone is improving lives. Young Ethnographers will collect first-hand accounts from PZ residents, businesses, and community leaders to prioritize their needs. They will connect residents with local government and promote a space for dialogue and participatory planning efforts to support the revitalization of the Promise Zone. 
 
 We will incorporate youth empowerment by introducing the cultural and political significance of the PZ’s diverse neighborhoods to our Young Ethnographers. By working in and learning more about the neighborhoods in which they live, each participant builds a layer of professional and personal investment. Youth that participate in this program are scholars, scientists, artists, athletes and activists in their own respect - full of untapped potential. LA2050 will unleash this potential by connecting youth to community-based work that will create long-term policy and advocacy solutions for our great city.","The Promise Zone encompasses many neighborhoods rich in racial, cultural and linguistic diversity. As LA2050’s research shows, 57% of LA residents speak languages other than English, more than double the figure for our nation as a whole. Our community survey is meant to be inclusive of and accessible to all Promise Zone residents regardless of primary language spoken, and we recognize that conducting surveys in English, Spanish, Thai, Korean and Armenian may prove to be a challenge. However, we hope to overcome this challenge by relying on our extensive Promise Zone partnership of 50+ multi-cultural organizations, service providers, and community leaders that are already affiliated with Promise Zone work. We will both rely on this network of partners and strategically hire youth from these cultures to accommodate our diverse neighborhoods and linguistic needs.","LAPZ has designed the following project goals and outcomes to guide evaluation. These ensure we meet our overarching goal of connecting residents to local government to increase government responsiveness to community needs.
  
 Project Goals:
 Create a Promise Zone leadership development and civic engagement program 
 Assess residents’ attitudes about quality of life in their neighborhood and identify neighborhood needs
 Develop policy and program recommendations for local government to implement
 Develop a multi-lingual survey instrument and playbook used by communities across the region
 
 Project Outcomes:
 A high quality, unique summer training and employment experience for 29 young PZ residents
 A successful survey administration effort yielding at least 1,800 surveys
 A policy and program recommendation report based on the resident survey
 A replicable survey instrument
 A playbook of community development and youth empowerment best practices and strategies","Survey administration is one of the most common forms of collecting information, but direct, face-to-face survey administration is not used as frequently, because it is labor intensive. The irony is that from a civic engagement perspective, nothing beats neighbors talking to neighbors about what their concerns and aspirations are. This is one way that our project is unique compared to other neighborhood assessments. Our work will build on the foundation laid by several earlier efforts, such as the Northeast LA Riverfront Collaborative (2014), Watts Community Studio (2013), and Hollywood Community Studio (2009-2012). While each of these earlier efforts engaged youth in survey administration to some degree, our project is unique in several ways.
 
 “Young Ethnographers” will be a key element of Promise Zone Partnership activities in 2016. The Promise Zone is President Obama’s signature anti-poverty initiative to transform neighborhoods and LA was selected as one of the first five Promise Zones in the entire country. It offers extensive public and private partnerships and serves as a platform to scale successful models like Youth Ethnographers, not only throughout the City but also nationally. 
 
 Young Ethnographers is framework for empowering youth to connect with their neighbors, and for communities to connect to local government. The project is designed to be an 8-week summer institute of 25 hours of training in civic engagement, and 95 hours of paid work experience. They will learn to engage their neighbors in survey administration, and will then gain valuable skills in data preparation and analysis, leading to a tangible quality of life report to guide policymakers in prioritizing community needs. Throughout 8 weeks, the Young Ethnographers will develop college and career skills like critical thinking, communication, and research. Another unique feature of our project is that we will place Young Ethnographers in their own neighborhood for Promise Zone surveys so it is truly connecting neighbors with neighbors.
 
 Young Ethnographers will be led by a Principal Investigator, a PhD student from a program such as the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation at USC. The Promise Zone team of five AmeriCorps VISTAs will support the project, and we will recruit five college students to serve as “team captains” and mentors to the Young Ethnographers.","The Promise Zone Partnership includes over 50 public and private sector agencies and organizations working in concert to build healthy neighborhoods and empower families in a federally designated zone within Central Los Angeles. The City of Los Angeles is the lead agency that oversees the initiative with the Youth Policy Institute as our lead implementation partner. One of the principal aims of the initiative is to break down silos between city departments and between service providers in the Promise Zone in order to work collaboratively to achieve Promise Zone Goals. To this end, we will engage multiple City departments, including Economic and Workforce Development Department, Recreation and Parks, and the Library system. In addition, the members of the PZ Partnership also lend support, such as our network of nonprofit service providers, LAPZ High School Principals, affordable housing developers and faith-based organizations. These partners will help ensure Young Ethnographers access a broad swath of Promise Zone residents, while also teaching Ethnographers about the rich history and culture of Promise Zone neighborhoods. 
 
 We will use the City’s existing Summer Youth Employment program as the administrative framework for the Young Ethnographers project. Our PZ partners, such as the Youth Policy Institute (YPI), Heart of Los Angeles, Artworx, Bresee Foundation, and Hollywood Boys and Girls Club, among others, as well as high school teachers and principals will help identify young leaders who would benefit from, and appreciate the unique training and work experience offered by this project. City facilities, like libraries and Recreation Centers will act as project hubs in the field during the survey administration period.
 
 The grant award will be invested entirely in the human capital that is needed to mount a successful youth empowerment and grassroots survey administration project. More than half will be invested in our youth survey teams; the balance supporting technical, research and writing support.","Young Ethnographers has been designed to ensure that the entire grant award is dedicated to summer youth development/resident survey administration activities. Ongoing administrative and project management costs of approximately $22,000 will be absorbed by the project sponsor, the Mayor’s Office. Leveraging scarce city and federal resources with this private sector investment, we can accomplish bold innovation in the City’s engagement and responsiveness to residents needs and concerns.
 
 LA2050 support is critical to this effort. While the Promise Zone comes with national recognition, it does not come with any direct funding. The lack of resources makes it extremely difficult to implement youth empowerment projects or to engage residents in a community assessment. This assessment is key in connecting local government to residents, and ensuring policymakers are responsive to community dreams and needs.","We propose the following budget for the LA2050 challenge grant award:
 
 A principal investigator to supervise survey administration, analysis and documentation - $15,000
 
 Five team captains, local college students, to act as team leaders for the survey effort - $15,000
 
 24 junior and senior high school students (summer youth employment program participants) - $48,000
 
 Gear and Provisions, such as tee-shirts, water, snacks, clipboards, paper, etc. - $1,000
 
 Report production - $4,000
 
 Playbook, funding for professional writing, graphic design - $15,000
 
 Contingency, in the event of unforeseen expenses - $2,000","The success of the Young Ethnographers project will be scaled in two ways. As a nationally recognized initiative, the Promise Zone offers a platform to share best practices throughout the City and across the country. Our hope is that Promise Zones throughout the US, as well as other communities, can take our model of youth civic engagement and empowerment to address the critical need to better connect residents to local government. We will share the survey instrument, training manuals and other materials, and overall framework on the Promise Zone website so this model can be scaled.
  
 Ultimately, LAPZ takes a multi-cultural and holistic approach in connecting LA’s most disconnected youth through a place-based approach that will be further supported by the very data that our Young Ethnographers help to collect. Youth recruited for these positions will be largely high school juniors and seniors, including homeless, foster, and/or juvenile justice-involved youth. Providing access to employment opportunities like these is a critical first step in a young person’s journey towards long-term financial empowerment and stability. 
 
 Youth who participate in this program are scholars, scientists, artists, athletes and activists in their own respect -- full of untapped potential. Funding from LA2050 will allow us to unleash this potential by connecting youth to meaningful community-based work that will create long-term policy and advocacy solutions for our great city. The efforts of Young Ethnographers will be scaled as policymakers use their assessment results and solutions to guide decision making. 
 The project will be further scaled as we send our Young Ethnographers off to college and careers, with the hope that they can apply what they learned over the course of this project. 
 
 Our proposal envisions the survey component to be a key deliverable in the form of a multi-lingual playbook that outlines strategies and best practices for community development that can be scaled and deployed to other regions of LA County. Identifying the Promise Zone’s next generation of leaders and change agents and delivering the promise of a Los Angeles as a functioning, well-run city that works with and for all Angelenos."

We are now in 14 schools serving 350 disadvantaged high school students this year. 
 
 The YBA provides a year-long after school course (""Introduction to Business & Careers"") to these students. The course description/breakdown is as follows: 
 
 1. The course meets every week for two hours for an entire year.
 
 2. The first hour of each 2 hour meeting has the instructor teaching the students about business/careers/entrepreneurship from a textbook (Careers for the 21st Century). In addition, students learn both the fundamental soft and hard skills a young professional will need to know to succeed in their future job or business. Students are taught critical elements such as how to communicate as a professional, resume writing, business plan development, and even participate in experiential exercises like a stock market trading game or a Shark Tank type pitch workshop.
 
 3. The second hour of each 2 hour meeting has a different Guest Speaker from the business community presenting their life journey to the class. 
  a.These Guest Speaker presentations include their childhood, high school, college, career and industry.
  b. In general, the Guest Speaker presentations are approximately 40 minutes along with 20 minutes of Q&A.
  c.The Guest Speaker program allows for these underprivileged students, most of whom have never met a single professional, aside from their teacher, to meet approximately 35 Guest Speakers over the course of the year. We have already seen some internships happen organically through the program.
 
 4. The YBA takes each class of students on 1-2 field trips per year to local area businesses. What an impact it makes for our students to get out of the classroom and see a thriving company up close and personal. We've had teachers who have told us that after these field trips, some of their students are so inspired they pick up their grades almost immediately. Past field trips have gone to Google, SpaceX and StartEngine (a technology incubator in Santa Monica).
 
 5. We are currently working on developing an additional element to YBA – A Summer Internship Program. This way our students can put the skills they have learned to use and gain valuable experience, not to mention earn some money in their pocket. Most importantly, the internship serves as a crucial springboard to catapult them into college and beyond.","One major barrier/challenge that we anticipate is lack of funding. It takes a lot of resources to operate in the 14 schools we are currently in, serving 350 students. There are about 35 schools on the waiting list who want the YBA Program. By next year would like to expand to 25 schools serving 625 students.
 
 Our strategy is to continue to apply for grants from different foundations like The Goldhirsh Foundation, seek partnerships with banks through the Community Reinvestment Act, and engage donors though appeals and fundraising events.
 
 We are also working on developing an internship program through our partnerships with local businesses. The business would pay a flat fee to employ high school graduates who have gone through the YBA program. YBA would handle payroll, logistics, insurance, and other details. Leftover resources would go towards funding the YBA program.","We will evaluate our work through:
 1. Student Surveys. YBA students will take a survey at the beginning of the program and at the conclusion to measure the program's effectiveness.
 2. Teacher/Couselor Feedback.
 3. Attendance and Persistence Rates
 4. Student GPA's
 5. Disciplinary and Suspension Rates
 5. High School Graduation Rates
 6. College Acceptance Rates

 YBA is unique in its approach that it covers both job readiness as well as entrepreneurial skills training. High School students need exposure to both elements to give them options in their future career. In addition, YBA students will meet roughly 35 guest speakers (professionals) throughout the course of the school year as opposed to 1 or 2.","We are currently working with Greendot High Schools, Alliance High Schools, and LAUSD. Currently, 100% of the grant award will go towards YBA.","To expand from 14 to 25 schools and go from serving 350 students to 625 students will cost an additional $171,750. We will cover any additional costs through private donations and fundraisers. Will we also continue to apply for foundation/corporate grants and seek partnerships with banks through the community reinvestment act.","Here is a snapshot of our 2016 budget.

 Net $25,750","We use Dropbox to give each YBA teacher access to our curriculum and as a hub to share information. Our custom website gives our teachers their own account to manage their weekly YBA schedule online for the entire school year. Our guest speakers also have their own account to upload their presentation and manage their speaking calendar. Everything is automated through the website, as well as email reminders to everyone involved in YBA whenever something needs to be done or there is an upcoming event.
 
 We are also currently working on standardized marketing material (flyers, videos, etc.) to help our teachers recruit students for the YBA Program. We are also working on releasing a best practices guide for all our teachers and guest speakers to ensure that there are systems in place and standards maintained. Next summer we plan on hosting a workshop for all YBA teachers to share ideas and what works. The internship program we are designing has huge potential to be a consistent funding source for YBA."
5102347,YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE: College Matched Savings Accounts,2018140,,,"YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE helps low-income students prepare for and go to college through financial education and a unique 3:1 match that puts $981 into special savings accounts for 1,300 students who otherwise may not be able to afford school. $981 is the gap to cover community college costs after financial aid, an amount that also makes it three times more likely students will enroll in college—and four times more likely they’ll graduate. That’s something great for L.A. now and in 2050.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,ALL,"L.A. is a wonderful place to learn, but only for those with access to opportunities. At the college level, access includes funds for entry and graduation. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE provides funding and financial education, along with academic and college readiness support, to help L.A. families learn and thrive. 
 
 An L.A. family earning less than $30,000 annually receives an average of $5,819 in financial aid toward the $6,800 annual cost of an L.A. community college. That leaves $981 still needed to make it happen. YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE steps in to provide this with special College Savings Individual Development Accounts paired with financial education, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. 
 
 Take Ricardo Morales, who is a student at College of the Canyons. He’s majoring in architecture. His brother Juan Daniel attends L.A. Mission College as a business major. Their youngest brother Jose is a senior in high school and hopes to attend college as well. Their family strongly believes in the importance of education, and the brothers are motivated to succeed, but their family has been concerned about the money it will take to help all three of them graduate. “I thought my children weren’t going to be able to go to college because we didn’t have the resources,” their mother says.
 
 But the family found YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, and all three sons signed up. With generous support from LA2050, all three can receive matching funds needed to help them achieve their college dreams. 
 
 Because YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE isn’t just a match. For every dollar a student puts into their account, our program will TRIPLE the amount, up to $660. Factor in two bonuses provided by the program, and suddenly each student has the $981 they need to cover what is otherwise a daunting funding gap for many low-income students.
 
 But this can only happen if—and only if—YPI receives $100,000 to match U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funds already in hand, because current YPI funding does not cover the match requirements. The support of LA2050 is vital to ensure that at least 262 more low-income L.A. students will have access to learn, changing their lives, their families’ lives, and the landscape of our city. 
 
 By 2050, not only will these students be college graduates—so will their children. Leveling the playing field and creating opportunity: That’s how we make L.A. the best place to learn.","The major strength of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is also its major barrier: providing a triple match to L.A. students in need. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will match deposits dollar-for-dollar, up to $494,650. That would mean putting $761 into the bank accounts of 1,300 low-income students. 
 
 This doesn’t just cover the gap for one year of college. The Assets and Education Initiative of the Corporation for Enterprise Development reports that children with even $500 saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate from college.
 
 YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE can therefore make it four times more likely that 1,300 young low-income L.A. students graduate college, profoundly changing their lives and the lives of their families for years to come. But we must raise $494,650 in nonfederal, private funds to make this happen. And $100,000 from LA2050 is a big part of this.","For YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE partnership with LA2050, we will evaluate our success based on achieving these goals: 
 
 At least 262 low-income students open matched College Savings Individual Development Accounts to receive $26 sign-up bonus.
 
 Each student saves at least $220 to receive 3:1 match.
 
 Each student makes deposits for six consecutive months to receive a $75 bonus match.
 
 In total, YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE students supported by LA2050 save over $250,000 to use for their college education (including students’ savings and matching funds).
 
 At least 262 students receive financial literacy education, financial coaching, and participate in a financial aid workshop to increase their financial capability.
 
 At least 262 students enroll in or continue college.
 
 This evaluation will allow us to see how YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE serves students like the Morales brothers and how, working together, we can change lives and transform the L.A. landscape.","YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE is a unique program and resource for the City of Los Angeles, because we integrate this program—and the students it supports—into a larger set of high-touch services for students and their families, all geared toward the goals of increasing academic achievement, elevating income, and improving access to support as we work to eradicate intergenerational poverty.
 
 There are four other L.A.-based organizations currently providing College Savings Individual Development Accounts to students. All are valuable members of our community, but they are all more narrowly focused on economic development. None of them provide YPI’s holistic array of individualized, wrap-around services that further create change in the lives of the students benefiting from college matched savings accounts. YPI does this not only through the financial literacy classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling that we require as part of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but also through college and career preparatory programs and counseling provided for our low-income families.
 
 This represents only one portion of our cradle-to-college-and-career continuum of programming that assists more than 100,000 people across 125 sites, including the students and families who will benefit from YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE. We operate five schools (three public charter and two LAUSD), 78 afterschool programs, and we’ve opened 83 Public Computer Centers. Our services include an extensive range of programs that encourage lifespan learning and self-sufficiency, such as academic tutoring; GED, ESL, and professional development programs; college preparation; job readiness and employment assistance; school dropout prevention services; reconnection services for out-of-school youth; early childhood development services; parenting education; health education and referral services; legal services; and individualized case management. All of these services are free of charge, and together with YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, provide an immersive and wide-scope set of opportunities for students and their families to change their lives—and therefore to change the landscape our city now and in 2050.","We are honored to have many L.A. organizations collaborating with us to maximize YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, but none of them would receive any portion of this grant award. Nor would YPI. Every single dollar of the $100,000 grant will go directly into matched college savings accounts for these ambitious L.A. students in need, like the Morales brothers.
 
 Although none of our partners are receiving any direct funding to support this project, they are deeply committed to making this program—and our families—thrive. YPI is working with a large and diverse array of collaborators to help us identify and recruit the initial 1,300 low-income students who will open matched college savings account during the first five years of our program, including LAUSD; the City of L.A.’s Housing & Community Investment Department FamilySource Centers; the City of L.A.’s Economic & Workforce Development Department YouthSource Centers; the Local Initiatives Support Corporation-funded Financial Opportunity Center; the Mexican Consulate; the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs; El Nido Family Centers; Hollygrove; Hollywood Community Housing Corporation; Korean Churches for Community Development; Los Angeles City College; Los Angeles Mission College; MEND; the Salvadoran American Leadership and Education Fund; the Thai Community Development Center; and the UCLA Community Based Learning Program.
 
 YPI is collaborating with Citi Community Development and Junior Achievement Finance Park to provide financial workshops and one-on-one financial counseling for our enrolled students and their families. We are also collaborating with AmeriCorps to provide College & Career Ambassadors and one-on-one college and career support to these undeserved students, which includes individualized counseling and workshops to help understand financial aid opportunities and complete financial aid applications. For banking access for the participating students, we are partnering with Citibank Financial Services to provide each student with a College Savings Individual Development Account through its Citi Microfinance Platform. 
 
 By working together, we look forward to putting $100,000 directly into the savings accounts of these L.A. students in need so they can graduate college and change the lives of their families for decades to come—the year 2050 and beyond.","The initial five years of YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE has a projected budget of $1,163,882. This amount establishes College Savings Individual Development Accounts for 1,300 low-income L.A. students and provides each of them with $761 in savings accounts funds ($660 in triple-match and $101 in savings incentives). This five-year budget also covers costs for financial literacy classes, financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial counseling—all of which are required elements for each student and family enrolled in YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE, in order to help ensure successful progress and completion. This budget also covers all personnel and administrative costs associated for five years of the program.
 
 YPI was honored to receive an Assets for Independence (AFI) grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which will cover 50% of this five-year budget—so long as we can match it with private funds. YPI therefore now has a profound opportunity to affect post-secondary success for L.A. students in need, but we can only do so with the participation of private funders. 
 
 This is both a humbling endorsement of our work and a call to do even better, in our longstanding mission to provide high quality education and much needed wraparound services to at-risk youth and families. While YPI has been successful in securing public funding, including this valuable Department of Health and Human Services grant, government grants are highly restrictive and do not cover all program costs. Private support helps our government dollars work harder and smarter, and shifting YPI’s internal systems in this much-needed way can only be done with the help of donors who see the value of its long-term impact. United Way of Greater Los Angeles is already joining us in creating this impact, and we will continue to pursue this extraordinarily necessary private funding through foundation grants and individual donors. 
 
 An award of $100,000 through LA2050 and the Goldhirsh Foundation will profoundly impact this program and the landscape of learning in Los Angeles. YPI cannot meet the needs of our families for college financial assistance without your help.","The entirety of the $100,000 for YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE will go directly into the College Savings Individual Development Accounts of low-income L.A. students who will otherwise not be able to afford college.
 
 When a student saves $220 in his/her account, our program adds triple that amount—bringing the account to $880. Our program also provides an initial sign-up bonus of $26, as well as a $75 bonus at the six-month mark, if the student has saved $120 in those first six months. In total, our program provides up to $761 of matching funds for each account.
 
 With $100,000, we can do this for 131 L.A. students. Because the Department of Health and Human Services will match this, that $100,000 becomes $200,000—and doubles the number of students helped to 262. That’s the three Morales brothers, plus 259 more young people in L.A. who otherwise will not be able to attend and complete college. Together, YPI and LA2050 can do it.","YPI’s COLLEGE PROMISE starts with an initial five-year plan to provide triple-matched college savings accounts to 1,300 low-income L.A. students, while concurrently providing them and their families with financial literacy classes, college financial aid workshops, and one-on-one financial coaching. After this initial term, we plan to extend and expand the program for another long-term period that can provide this opportunity to an additional 2,600 students—doubling our current number of students. 
 
 We can do this—and support this model throughout our L.A. region—by continuing to view the program in the scope of high-touch, individualized, and place-based support for youth and their families, providing them with a holistic range of services that create empowerment and change for all aspects of their learning and their lives. We will continue collaborating with community organizations, government programs, and private funders to ensure future success for these L.A. students.
 
 As the program continues and expands, we will be mindful of re-shaping it to meet family, neighborhood, and community needs. Financial education curriculum and design of matched savings accounts will be replicated through staff training and strong relationships with financial institutions. But other components—such as participant outreach and retention (regular savings deposits)—will be customized based on language, cultural, and other considerations specific to the many communities, populations, and traditions that are part of our L.A. landscape.
 
 Our L.A. landscape is itself a dynamic element of change. Partnering with LA2050, we’re optimistic that by the year 2050 the beneficiaries of these matched college savings accounts will be sending their own children to college—part of a tradition of learning in Los Angeles where everyone who wishes for, envisions, and strives for college enrollment and completion can achieve it."
