In 2009, three friends at UCLA who were going into architecture, law, and business sought to use the power of good design in order create positive social change. They embarked on a journey that led them somewhere between anthropology, journalism, and design and this unique approach has continued as the organization now focuses on place-based, social research and media production that reveals the overlooked, the misunderstood, and the opaque.
  
  
  Our organizations achievements are intimate, personal, and real: we engage directly with disenfranchised communities to make their stories heard. We are strong believers in the power of storytelling, and the achievements we are most proud of include a multi-media journalistic exploration of migrant workers around the 2008 World Expo in Shanghai, another exploration of an amazing community of people that live in buses in Venice, and a public awareness campaign for Los Angeles that encourages people to meet their neighbors.
  
  We have also partnered with a number of individuals and institutions in order to achieve our goals, including designers, storytellers, researchers, and cool folks like the people at metaLAB at Harvard. They developed a web application called Zeega that we are currently working with to tell the story of Hmong communities in California, among other things.",22 Art,05 Workforce development,,,,

A+D is the only cultural institution in the United States showcasing continuous programs on architecture and design. Through exhibits, symposia, multi-disciplinary projects, educational and community programming, A+D is a showcase for the work of important regional, national and international designers, providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism, and design. <p/>
  
 
  
  <p> A+D has collaborated with important institutions such as the The Getty Center, AIA, SCI-Arc, the LA Forum as well as emerging and established architects. The museum has produced over 30 world class exhibits and received Awards of Merit for education programming from The American Architectural Foundation.

  Through a collaborative six-month process ALA worked with stakeholders from around the country to develop the Strategic Guide on Scaling Shared Housing, which highlights the exciting work happening in the field and identifies the new opportunities for growth. For example, New York City used shared housing as a disaster response solution in the wake of super storm Sandy. 
  

  With the support of Enterprise Community Partners and the Archstone Foundation, ALA hosted a Shared Housing Symposium that convened leaders from Illinois, Vermont, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Michigan and California to launch the Strategic Guide and discuss ideas for reinvigorating this decades-old movement.

The Alzheimer's Association, California Southland Chapter is a pioneer in the development of innovative programs and services specific to the needs of a diverse population effected by dementia. Access to care has been a long-term investment of effort by out organization. In 1992, the California Southland Chapter was the lead and originator of the nationâ€™s first program serving Latinos with dementia, El Portal. This program received numerous national awards including the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Community Health Leadership Award. El Portal has been replicated in numerous locations throughout the state and beyond. It has also been replicated in African American, Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese communities. The Chapterâ€™s program for Asian Americans with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and their caregivers was awarded the 2006 Met Life Foundation/National Center for Caregiving award for innovation in education and Alzheimerâ€™s disease and the 2011 Rosalynn and Arthur Gilbert Foundationâ€™s Caregiving Legacy Award.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>The challenge of delivering quality health care to people with dementia has also been addressed successfully by this chapter of the Association. These efforts have also led to national recognition. For example, a quality improvement project with Kaiser Permanente was awarded the American Society on Agingâ€™s 2001 Award for Quality and Innovation in Managed Care and Aging. Our consumer activation project, Partnering with Your Doctor, was honored with the Archstone Foundation-American Public Health Associationâ€™s 2003 Award for Excellence in Program Innovation and adopted for national replication by the Alzheimerâ€™s Association. It was also adopted in parts of Great Britain. The local chapter of the Alzheimerâ€™s Association has led three statewide efforts to create and disseminate an evidence-based practice guideline that teaches primary care providers about quality post-diagnostic care for people with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. This California Guideline for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Management became the stimulant for numerous quality improvement projects in health care organizations throughout California including Kaiser Permanente, Scripps Health Care, UC San Diego Health Care and SCAN Health Plan. This chapter also played a leadership role in the development of the State of Californiaâ€™s Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Plan which was released in 2011.</p>",25 Disability & aging,12 Community health,,,,

  In the mid-2000â€™s, the facilities thrived as a center for at-risk youthâ€”servings over 300 students per year. During this time frame, Art Share L.A. created its FACT program (Families and Communities Together). This program, created in collaboration with Stevenson Middle School in Boyle Heights and the LA County Probation Department, has helped families in crises for 8 yearsâ€”pairing trained social workers with families in creative and expressive environments to explore conscious and constructive problem-solving skills. 
  
  
  
  
  
  The economic downturn of 2008 hit Art Share L.A. in an almost devastating manner. The organization and its management struggled to make ends meet. By the summer of 2011, all staff had been cut and the agency was operating on a shoe-string budget. Property buy-out offers were on the table, but the new board of directors was dedicated to keeping Art Share L.A. owned and operated by and for the community. The new directors, under guidance of city planner, Elizabeth Peterson, brought the facilities into a new era, complete with new paint job and new staff. 
  
  
  
  
  
  In the summer of 2012, Art Share L.A. ventured on a partnership that would bridge the worlds of outdoor advertising and street artâ€”two sectors who until recently have rivaled for public space and the rights to it. In March of 2013, Art Share L.A. (in collaboration with Casey Zoltan of Known Gallery and 15 of the cities most renowned street artists) launched the second installment of the project. Since inception in 2012, more than two-dozen street artists have legally showcased on billboards through a rotating citywide gallery exhibit.

Our work demonstrates the impact of advocacy by parents, students, teachers, small business owners, and government, corporate, and private foundation supporters. During 2012, 4,538 unique arts advocates sent 16,259 letters to policymakers through the Arts for LA website on 12 local campaigns. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Our most recent advocacy success was the unanimous passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution by the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) on October 9, 2012. The resolution affirms and protects arts education as core curriculum, like science and math, and its impact has been nationwide. Arts for LA has been contacted by education advocates in New York City and Chicago who want to pursue similar resolutions for their districts. This success is even more remarkable considering that in December 2011, LAUSD had announced its plans to eliminate arts education for elementary students in response to budget cuts. Throughout the spring of 2012, Arts for LA devoted its communication platform to generate public awareness of the issue, and our efforts resulted in 4,928 letters to LAUSDâ€™s school board members and Superintendent Dr. John Deasy, PhD. In June, LAUSD reached an agreement that restored arts education for elementary school students, which laid the foundation for passage of the â€œArts at the Coreâ€ resolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  The success of our campaigns has demonstrated the value and role of advocacy, not only for arts and culture groups, but for nonprofits of all disciplines. In 2012, the Los Angeles City Admin. Office recommended the city abolish a program that allows a number of nonprofits to pay $1 rent per year on city-owned buildings, instead of market rate rent. This measure would save the city $3 million, but endanger, if not eliminate, the nonprofits that provide health, arts, education, conservation, and other human services to vulnerable populations. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Arts for LA rallied arts organizations and other community stakeholders such as LA Conservation Corps, ONE Generation, People Coordinated Services, West LA FamilySource Center, and others. Through the Arts for LA communications platform, over 3,000 advocates wrote to the LA City Council urging them to require a public hearing, including an economic impact statement on the nonprofit infrastructure. The City Council agreed, and the proposal has not been pursued since our stakeholders took action.
  
  
  
  
  
  Campaigns such as this have generated thoughtful responses to advocates from public officials, while the focus on positive, solutions-based advocacy has earned the organization and its network of advocates the respect of local policymakers, who are increasingly willing to meet with organizational leadership. Arts for LA believes these indicators point to a more engaged and empowered creative community, and policymakers who are recognizing the role of arts & culture in the health of the region.",22 Art, ,,,,

AEP will assess and administer any business in the arts and culture sector (Museums, Theaters, Art Galleries, Dance Studioâ€™s, Production Offices, Arts related non-profits and Cultural Centers.) LACCD will handle restaurants, garages and general offices and Los Angeles Visitor and Tourism Board will handle green hotels and lodgings. Any business that goes through AEP certification will be recognized as a green business by the City of Los Angeles. We also have the exact same arrangement with the City of Santa Monica and their green business administrator Sustainable Works. This is a powerful new system of greening businesses through non-profits rather then city departments and is unlike any in the country or world.

The Club then operated for many years from a converted duplex home on Lincoln Boulevard, which was finally condemned after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In 2000, after a successful capital campaign, the Club celebrated the grand opening of its new 30,000 sq.ft. facility at 2232 Lincoln Boulevard. The new Club features a basketball court and gymnasium, stage area, kitchen, teen/career center and store, counseling department, community room, music room, wellness center, art studio, activity center, computerized learning center, library, and administrative offices. 
  
  The past year has been an amazing culmination of opportunity meeting execution. Through the generosity of our donors and volunteers and with the care and commitment of our staff, we have created an environment where reaching new heights is the norm, and excellence prevails in many areas of the Club.

The establishment of this clinic has streamlined care for chronically ill patients with brain cancer, and the demands placed on accommodating patients within this clinic highlights the need for this integral service to the population of LA County as a whole. Over the past decade, we have treated thousands of patients with complex benign and malignant brain and spine tumors using various combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and have always strived to maintain the highest comparable standards with regard to quality of care as we have done for patients at our affiliated USC Norris Cancer Center (one of three National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Centers in Southern California). Perhaps most importantly, we have maintained an open door policy in treating all-comer patients with brain cancer referred from dozens of hospitals all over Southern California, and have never turned a patient with the diagnosis of a brain tumor away based on insurance or socioeconomic status. We have enrolled hundreds of patients in some of the latest and most promising clinical trials available worldwide. Our program has been the major site of the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, and chronicles information on all new cancer cases in LA County (approximately 30,000 patients per year). The LA County Cancer Surveillance Program is now the largest contributing registry to the NCI-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Many of our Brain Tumor Center physicians are internationally recognized for their contributions to patient care and clinical-translational research, and have won numerous awards in recognition of their research contributions.

This year, Connectors established â€œCollege Clubsâ€ for middle school students and our juniors and seniors to encourage college and career exploration. These after-school clubs provide fundamental information on the college admissions process and help students explore their career interests. Students learn how to research colleges online, navigate the admissions process, and receive the information and guidance when applying to colleges and universities.

The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and was streamed globally. During the think tank several ideas were generated including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15 Global Challenges and create films about their stories. In 2012 the first class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the internet to create Mythic Challenges projects.

With 31 community groups organized in 11 strategic counties, California Calls is mounting a long-term, ambitious civic engagement program to build a powerful base of voters in low-income and immigrant communities of color, with a special focus on educating and turning out new, occasional and young voters.
  
  
  
  
  
  California Calls member organizations work on many issues: health and human services, education, immigrantâ€™s rights, environmental justice, housing, jobs, living wages. In addition to the electoral mobilization program, the member organizations employ a broad range of strategies to advance their work: grassroots community organizing, leadership development, policy research, direct action, legislative advocacy, and public policy campaigns. 
  
  
  
  
  
  The long-term goal of California Calls is to develop a bottom-up statewide alliance of organizations with the power to turn out 500,000 supporters of progressive tax and fiscal reforms who normally do not participate in elections. In addition, California Calls actively works to build collaborations with other statewide organizations who share the same vision of renewing the â€œCalifornia Dreamâ€ wherein the state can offer a world class public education system, a vital social safety net, and a modern public infrastructure to support dynamic and sustainable economic growth.
  
  
  
  
  
  Since 2009, California Calls has identified more than 574,000 unlikely voters in 11 counties across the state who express support for progressive tax and budget policies. In November 2012, the California Calls Action Fund supported Proposition 30 (see video), a ballot measure which has already generated over $6 billion annually for Californiaâ€™s K-12 schools and the UC/CSU higher education systems. Through a massive â€œground gameâ€ of get-out-the-vote activities, California Calls contacted 293,613 voters, of which 80% made it to the polls! This compared with average statewide voter turnout of only 71%. These voters represented a crucial margin of victory, providing over 3% of the statewide vote total for new funding for education, social service and public safety programs. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Key groups of historically under-represented constituencies voted at even higher margins:

This exclusive opportunity is only offered to one out of every 2,000 high school students in Los Angeles. The program will allow BLOOMers an opportunity for regular exposure to the daily operations behind one of the most successful entertainment companies in the world while learning critical job skills that will make them competitive in the workplace.

  James is completing his senior year at Evans Community Learning Center in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. James is on probation for being involved with a grand theft auto incident. He would like to attend San Diego State University in the fall. His interests lie in Human Behavior and Philosophy. James has participated in community service activities such as feeding the homeless and neighborhood beautification projects. People who meet James find it hard to believe he has any association to Probation. However, James recently shared that, â€œI thought I was living life the way it was supposed to be lived in the inner-city. I just didnâ€™t know better.

BLOOM is also one of five philanthropic initiatives featured in Where Do We Go from Here?: Philanthropic Support for Black Men and Boys, a report published in October 2012 by The Foundation Center.

Part of that fight has been to ensure that the children in our communities receive a quality education and cultural teachings. Through educational reform advocacy, educational programs, and active roles in the design and implementation of new school structures, CARECEN seeks solutions everyday to the obstacles our youth face in achieving success and in the development of the arts and culture component that defines their and that of their families personal struggle. 
  
  
  Currently CARECEN offers an Art & Culture Program for children and youth in the Pico Union/Westlake Community, as well as, a dedicated Parent Center, which provides families education around the role of community schools. Each program is based around the need of the community to never lose sight of the roots of their native culture and an in-depth analysis of the continuous struggle for immigrant children to receive a quality education. 
  
  
  CARECEN has offered after school programs for youth since 1992; then called, Nueva Generacion (New Generation), the original program was focused on helping youth learn work skills and become familiar with the computer. In 1998, when the agency moved into its 30,000-sq.ft community center it was able to expand the age range of participants as well as the programs offered. From 1998 until today, education programs have included academic enrichment, cultural projects, a summer youth program, parent involvement, field trips and a special focus on being college-ready.
  
  
  With the continuous educational cutbacks on all levels (local, state and federal), schools within a 5-10 mile radius of CARECEN will experience continuous setbacks, for example â€“ the cuts to arts and culture, parent centers and academic enrichment programs.

We have been fortunate to be able to do a lot with very little, never stopping, never settling and constantly taking on new challenges with vigor. For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals -- which today stand as our most far-reaching and well-attended events -- started very small. Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (weâ€™ve literally had to shut down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything).

The winners of the very first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as â€œbandsâ€ to watch and have developed large local followings.

Our show now regularly features more than upwards of 175 performers representing a wide variety of dance companies, studios, individual choreographers, and even school programs. 
  
  The performance opportunities provided by Dancescape have helped emerging artists to gain representation, exposure, and experience as well as network with leading professionals in the industry. Numerous dancers have gotten jobs, joined companies, or been asked to dance in new works or projects as a direct result of Dancescape.
  
  
  The students who participate - whether from private dance studios or those who participate in school programs - are given the chance to watch professional dancers in an intimate setting, to perform in a state of the art facility outside of their usual environment, and interact with other students their age from different programs who specialize in styles of dance that are different from their own. They gain perspective on the role arts can play in the world at large, beyond the walls of the classroom, while simultaneously developing the discipline, responsibility, and self-esteem that comes with participating in a performance related activity.
  
  
  In 2007, we began working with DonorsChoose.org to identify the local arts and music education programs we wished to support. Since then, we have fully or partially funded 39 classroom proposals, mostly in high needs, high poverty schools. These programs have reached more than 6,000 students in Southern California.

Dancescape will identify the dance instructor, cover the costs of all necessary background checks and clearance procedures, and also pay the salaries of both the dance instructor and the LALA staff member who will assist with the program. The curriculum will be developed together with the LALA faculty to determine what will be best suited to the students in attendance.

We designed and built the City Bin, a modern and compact indoor composter that will allow EVERYONE to compost, regardless of the size of their living space or yard. The City Bin will soon be in production locally in Los Angeles County and will be manufactured using recycled plastic. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Both City Earthworm and the City Bin have been featured in blogs, newspapers, as well as in television news programs. 
  
  
  
  
  
  City Earthworm realizes that, while it would be great to allow more people to compost at home, there will also be some people who do not want to or are unable to do so. The easiest way to truly popularize composting is to make it easy for people. Therefore, we started offering a food service pick-up program to apartment dwellers in Santa Monica. We now hope to expand our service to the entire Los Angeles County.",14 Air and water, ,,,,

Our first pilot program at Manual Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance instruction and resulted in all program graduates going on to attend 4-year universities, as well as continuing to pursue the arts. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>In 2012, we expanded our pilot program to include instruction in all three performing arts disciplines for 35 students at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High School. CITYstage also ensured high-quality instruction by employing working professionals in the LA performing arts community. During an Arts Discovery pilot, 25 students were taken to a variety of events including youth stand-up comedy at The Improv, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at the Ahmanson Theatre and music and dance performances at the Colburn School. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Students who visited the Colburn School live in the shadow of Downtown LA, yet had never visited the cultural center of their own city â€“ less than 3 miles from home.

The Student Director role also gives a powerful voice to our most important stakeholders â€“ our students. We can only ensure the viability of our programs and build a lasting foundation for the arts if we actively listen to and address the needs of the communities we serve. </p>", , ,,,,

  <p>Community Monitoring System and Compliance Report Card: The LA Black Worker Center (BWC) developed and piloted a community monitoring tool to foster greater community and worker participation in decision-making processes and to increase access to information in the public contraction arena. The tool provides a mechanism for accountability to the community on public infrastructure investments and how jobs are created. The BWC worked with graduate students and undergraduate research interns to develop a community monitoring tool called the â€œPublic Construction Report Card,â€ which allows local residents and workers to evaluate and grade contractorsâ€™ past practices of employing a representative workforce. The report card evaluated contractors by using indicators such as community outreach and relations, accessibility, civil rights compliance, and transparency. The BWC supervised a team of BWC members and students who tested the report card tool in the field. The tool focused on four bidding contractors on the $1.7 billion Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor Project. Though this was a test of the tool, the results proved the public construction report card was a powerful monitoring mechanism in the high-stakes conversations with the contractors. In the end, each contractor team pledged to improve their â€œgradesâ€ and invited the BWC to be directly involved in their workforce pipeline process. The results of the report card pilot became the subject of high-level discussions between the office of Congresswoman Karen Bass, construction team executives, BWC members, and LA Metro staff. </p>",05 Workforce development,19 Voting & civic engagement,,,,

  â€¢ One of the Coalitionâ€™s first campaigns â€œRebuild South Central Without Liquor Storesâ€ led to national recognition and implementation of the Coalitionâ€™s public health model, which uses nuisance abatement and land use policy to improve public safety. After the 1992 Civil Unrest, this campaign led to the prevention of the rebuilding of over 150 liquor stores that were destroyed.

  â€¢ In 2004, South LA relative caregivers helped Community Coalition along with Casey Family Programs, the nationâ€™s largest provider of private foster care, secure and establish a kinship-care support center in South LA, the first ever in the region to combine services with advocacy and community organizing. Community Coalitionâ€™s Relative Caregivers have been one of the first organized and politicized constituencies in the nation to advocate around kinship-care policies and engage elected officials around providing relative caregivers public resources.

http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/CuriousFoodTruck.html,2013049,Curious Catalyst,www.curiouscatalyst.com,TBC,,For profit,"<p>Curious Catalyst is a new consultancy that employs agile and lean methodologies typically associated with disruption in ICT to drive transformation and innovation in urban planning. Composed of a senior corps of emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs. We use a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the solutions we develop to other mega-cities. For example, when we design a business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plug-and-play core â€œExperience Blueprintâ€ will be released to other cities for a nominal license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to the initial stakeholder. And we provide consulting services for localization and contextual adjustment.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>This disruptive business model was developed by founder, Kaz Brecher, as part of an accelerator project at THNK, the new Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership. The members of the Curious Catalyst team have collectively worked on strategy and implementation of solutions for everyone from the Library of Congress to Microsoft, and Disney to Oprah. Weâ€™ve done hundreds of agile sprints in emerging platforms, and our expertise is easily applied to the complexities of urban challenges facing Los Angeles.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>The company has garnered support from some of the top architects and urban developers in the world, as weâ€™re building our Advisory Board. And as passionate believers in user-centered design, we are committed to genuine collaboration with all constituencies when developing approaches to these solutions.</p>",19 Voting & civic engagement, ,Planning and pubilc space,,,

  In one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this at-risk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.
  
  I saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost - and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.
  
  
  Our team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals. 
  
  Many of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.
  
  So far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events in LA this year.
  
  Previously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of all ages:
  
  
  * Creating arts events and collaborations including
  
  
  * Festivals, big events and social connectedness games
  
  
  * Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula
  
  
  * Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes

  Founder Non-Profit ""Enriching Communities""
  
  
  Once upon a time, I was known as a ""selfish little girl with a horrible attitude"", who at 14 knew everything and ""didn't need anyone to tell me â€œAnything"", until that one late evening when my mother found me sitting on my bed crying into my Trigonometry book, with my TI-82 in hand. My mom asked, ""What was wrong?"" With tears in my eyes, I looked at my mom for the first time feeling like a failure. I responded, ""I don't know how to do this! I've failed my 2nd math test!"" My mom felt the defeat and sadness in my words. She hugged me and told me, she would figure it out and she would get me some help.
  
  
  By the end of the week, my mother had found Educating Young Minds (EYM) and Ms. Echols in the yellow pages. I arrived at EYM, embarrassed to admit I needed help. (Please take note I had been an honor roll student since the first grade.) Asking for help was something I didn't know how to do. As my mother and I sat with Ms. Echols she looked at me, then at my mom, asking a lot of questions. I gave one word responses with the most negative attitude you could imagine. That's when Ms. Echols respectfully asked my mother to leave, no, she told her to get out of her office. What happened in that office I rather not mention today, just know that it was done with love and respect and I learned a lot of humility! The rest is history and was truly a blessing!
  
  
  
  
  
  Needless to say, not only did I pass my Trigonometry class, I became one of the first students to receive a scholarship from EYM in 1999 and graduated from USC with honors in 2003. In 2007, I graduated with a Masters Degree in Counseling- Marriage & Family Child Therapy. Today I am a very humble and proud wife and mother, who is employed with the Los Angeles County Probation Department as a Deputy Probation Officer II.

  ERW Design is experienced working with a wide array of neighborhoods and communities throughout Los Angeles. Some notable projects include the Marsh Park Pavilion at Marsh Park, the first regional park on the LA River in Elysian Village; the Vista Hermosa Park structures in downtown Los Angeles; Beverly Gardens Park Restoration in Beverly Hills; and an all-ages exhibition gallery at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

  SALT has been working with the Trust for Public Land (www.tpl.org), also our partner for Park-in-a-Box, over the past year to bring significant changes to the Avalon community of Los Angeles, south of downtown. SALT developed a master plan for the pedestrian opportunities in the community, including a thorough analysis of the existing pedestrian challenges and degraded mobility infrastructure. We also developed designs for the conversion of more than 1,800 linear feet of alleyways into storm water infiltration centers and enhanced pedestrian and bicycle pathways. This project has already received over $1.7 million in funding to date in public funding from various local, county and state agencies and expects to have the construction documents completed by the end of 2013.
  
  
  SALT also co-founded the Take Back the Boulevard (TBTB) initiative in 2011 in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. TBTB is seeking to bring significant pedestrian improvements to Colorado Boulevard through a grass-roots and community based effort, focused on recapturing a portion of the public right-of-way from automobile traffic and reallocating it for other modes of transportation.

  <p>Since our website launched just three years ago on Earth Day 2010, Grades of Green has grown rapidly and expanded internationally with more than 104,000 students in 27 states and four countries enrolled in our programs. Grades of Green has been honored with several awards over the last four years, including the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s prestigious Environmental Award, a United States Conference of Mayors Award, as well as being instrumental in two Grades of Green schools being designated as â€œGreen Ribbon Schoolsâ€ by the U.S. Department of Education. </p>
  
  <p>PROGRAM WORK</p>
  
  <p>Through our program work, we have brought and are bringing real environmental change to our communities. Some examples include: helping more than 50 Los Angeles County schools divert over 50,000 bags of trash from local landfills through our Trash Free Lunch Program; helping several California schools districts stop the use of toxic cleaning supplies in their schools; performing a â€œgreeningâ€ of 10 underserved schools in the Los Angeles area and helping them set up waste reduction programs, including in-class recycling and lunch-time sorting systems; and assisting several local schools end the use of Styrofoam trays at lunch time. Should we receive one of the LA2050 grants, we look forward to continuing this hands-on program work in the schools within the LAYC. </p>
  
  <p>EMPOWERING OUR YOUTH</p>
  
  <p>While we are proud of the recognition our organization has received and the projects we have led, we believe our most important work is teaching our children that they have the power to make a difference. As noted above, it was Grades of Green students who went to their City Councils in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach to ask for bans of plastic bags and Styrofoam. Inspired by those stories, El Segundo High School students recently went to their City Council to ask that additional recycling containers be placed around town. </p> 
  
  <p>Several of our existing Youth Corps students have received national and regional recognition for their environmental efforts, including Grace C and Sam H who were named as Champions for Change by the White House, and Max R and Reese R, who were featured in a Washington Post article about banning Styrofoam. </p>
  
  <p>Other Youth Corps and Grades of Green students are tackling environmental problems big and small at their schools and in their communities. For example, Yaeeun H is using Grades of Green 3R curriculum to teach kids at her school about how and why to protect the environment; Sydney H, a sixth grader, is organizing an e-waste collection drive at her school; Sam H is collecting used shoes to donate to Soles for Souls; and Lauren S and Jenna R, both sixth graders, are working to plant a native garden at their school. These kids are the future of Los Angeles and our best hope of making our vision for Los Angeles a reality in 2050. </p>",03 Teaching & mentorship,14 Air and water,,,,

We have consistently created productions, workshops and art programs that have grown from our engagement with diverse communities. Our longevity reflects our ability to change, innovate and respond to the needs of the times. 
  
  In 1978, Founder/Artistic Director, Nobuko Miyamoto established Great Leap as a non-profit arts organization creating concerts and musical theater works reflecting the Asian American experience, successfully mounting and touring musicals â€œChop Sueyâ€ and â€œTalk Storyâ€ on the West Coast and Hawaii. 
  
  In response to the racial conflicts of Los Angeles Uprising in 1992, Great Leap became a multicultural arts organization, presenting the first-voice stories of Asian, Latino and African American artists in â€œA Slice of Rice, Frijoles and Greens.â€ To this day the performance tours colleges including a yearly show at UCLAâ€™s Medical School as cultural awareness training for new interns. Our youth version toured schools for 10 years, reaching 50,000 youth yearly with the Music Center on Tour program.
  
  In 2001, the events of 9/11 pushed us to create workshops and that brought together people from the Muslim, Buddhist, Christian and Jewish communities. We created a sacred space where people could share their stories and traditions, and experienced the power of the bonding that resulted. From this we developed the theater piece â€œLeaps of Faith,â€ performed at the 2009 World Parliament of Religions in Australia. 
  
  Great Leap has also designed Arts and Yoga for Youth, a program for USCâ€™s Upward Bound program, training and creating performances with young people. In 2005 we created our artist mentorship program, Collaboratory to pass on our creative practices to the next generation. We are now doing the tenth cycle of Collaboratory in Long Beach, with Cambodian, Samoan and Tongan artists and community members who will learn Great Leapâ€™s creative and collaborative methodology in theater making and community building. 
  
  Now we are using our environmental music video series, â€œEco-Vidsâ€ as an innovative way to engage communities of color with the critical issue of Climate Change and highlight the sustainable practices passed down the generations. The first, â€œB.Y.O. Chopstix,â€ promotes conservation by using disposable chopsticks; â€œMottainaiâ€ tells the story of the Japanese tradition of â€œNo Waste,â€ and â€œCycles of Change,â€ a collaboration between Quetzal and Nobuko, encourages urban families to bicycle for their health and the environment. Since 2010 the Ecovids have received over 45,000 views on YouTube.",21 Community gatherings,22 Art,,,,

The organization has been a resource for families for over 13 years, continually refining programs and services to best meet the changing needs of a diverse population. Consequently V2K HELPER has access to a large population of low- and middle-income families who trust the organization to provide respectful guidance and effective services.
  
  The organization is consistently sought out as a collaborative partner by other community agencies and has an excellent track record of responsibly managing funding from state, county, public, private, and corporate funders. Following are some specific ways V2K HELPER has been recognized as exemplifying excellence in its field:
  
  â€¢ Since 1999, V2K-HELPER has been funded by the City of Los Angeles services to implement a comprehensive violence prevention/intervention program.
  
  â€¢ Since 2007, V2K-HELPER has implemented City of Los Angeles GRYD Program in multiple Zones, providing services to youth and young adults with an annual budget of at least $750,000. 
  
  â€¢ Community Development, with an emphasis on low-to-moderate (LMI) communities and individuals addressing: small business education, business retention, entrepreneurial and employment training, and workforce development programs 
  
  â€¢ Community Development, with an emphasis on affordable housing 
  
  
  â€¢ Currently we provide direct service and linkages to the following services free of charge each month to approximately 200 men, women and children:
  
  
  o Comprehensive wrap-around services that include 
  
  
  ï‚§ counseling, gang intervention, conflict resolution, substance abuse, 
  
  
  ï‚§ Job training and placement services, tattoo removal, mental health services
  
  
  We provide a myriad of services throughout Los Angeles County, with primary emphasis in Venice Beach and South Central Los Angeles. Our academic arm provides a professionally and socially enriched facility for graduate and undergraduate training. Venice 2000/ H.E.L.P.E.R. Foundation is considered to be a model at-risk youth service facility and therefore attracts interns and social work students from major universities, such as USC, Loyola Marymount University, and University of California Los Angeles. We subscribe to comprehensive, integrated, community-based collaborative approach providing services to youth that enhances community safety while strengthening and preserving families. Our guiding philosophy is that children and youth must be preserved if the integrity of our society at-large is to be preserved. If families are to be responsible units, they must have access to healthy living environments, adequate food, and education for all its members, employment, and access to health services and freedom from gang, domestic and civil violence.",17 Community safety,05 Workforce development,,,,

One important focus of our exhibitions and artist programs is highlighting emerging and under-recognized artists. Last summer we organized L.A.â€™s first ever biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. 2012, which showcased 60 emerging local artists in four venues across the city. The Hammer is also proud of its 14 year old Hammer Projects exhibition series which features emerging local and international artists in what is often their first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Through our public engagement program, launched in 2010, the Hammer has established itself as a leader in innovation through unique and unexpected artist projects that challenge visitorsâ€™ notions of traditional museum experiences. As a cultural center, the Hammer also attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year to our multidisciplinary public programs which take place in our state-of-the-art Billy Wilder Theater and adjacent Courtyard, and which include literary readings, artist performances, film screenings, musical acts, meditation sessions, and scholarly and popular culture presentations. All of the Hammerâ€™s public programs are free to the public and we feel strongly that we could be helpful to both artists and our neighbors if the vitality and sense of community that the Hammer enjoys could spill out into our commercial neighborhood as well.",22 Art,21 Community gatherings,,,,

  A feature that distinguishes Harmony Project among other local arts education programs is that we commit to children throughout their entire childhood, regardless of their changing schools and circumstances. With a strong focus on peer mentorship, family support, and college incentives, Harmony Project changes the course of disadvantaged childrenâ€™s lives. While dropout rates exceed 50% in the communities we serve, 95% of Harmony Projectâ€™s high school seniors have graduated in four years and virtually all have gone on to college or trade school. In addition, Harmony Project provides college incentives and scholarship opportunities to help facilitate the difficult transition to college. In May, we learned that one of our former students, Brettany Tucker, became a Fulbright Scholar for the 2012-13 school year! Moreover, four current students were accepted and now attend the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, one of the premier public arts high schools in the US!
  
  
  
  
  
  In January, Harmony Projectâ€™s YOLA/EXPO orchestra attended master classes with SÃ­mÃ³n BolÃ­var Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, and also performed together at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Downtown LA. In attendance was El Sistema founder JosÃ© Antonio Abreu â€“ El Sistema is the hugely successful Venezuelan music program that Harmony Project is in part modeled after.

  - In the last academic year, 324 students participated in intensive art classes in a multi-level class structure that built and advanced with each session. Each quarter, HOLA offered the community 33 free visual art classes and 37 hours of professional art instruction.
  
  - HOLAâ€™s Visual Arts students attended 19 field trips to museums, art institutions, art studios and more. HOLA also welcomed a diverse group of more than 36 visiting artists to its campus.
  
  - The first year of the Public Art Project culminated in a community-wide event in MacArthur park that brought together more than 2,000 community members.
  
  - In 2011, the completely renovated Lafayette Park Community Center reopened, an expansion that helped HOLA significantly increase the number of students served annually. Throughout its nine academic, enrichment and support programs, HOLA served 2,497 students in 2012, an increase of more than 60% from the prior year.

  - HOLA provided FREE programming six days a week all year long.
  
  - At the core of HOLAâ€™s success is a strong team of volunteers. HOLAâ€™s volunteer corps has grown to more than 700, 190 of which donated 10 hours or more in the last year alone. 
 
  - The number of HOLAâ€™s youngest students performing at or above grade level increased from 69% to 84%
  
  - While area high schoolsâ€™ graduation rates often fall below 50%, HOLA saw 100% of its seniors graduate from high school and enroll in colleges and universities across the country.
  
  - The Alumni and Scholarship Program now supports over 150 alumni enrolled in 75 colleges and universities; of those students who began college in the last three years and participated in the formal Alumni Program, 93% are still enrolled in a two- or four-year institution.
  
  - This year, HOLA awarded more than $195,000 in college scholarships to 83 alumni and assisted these students in securing over $1,189,972 in State, Federal and Institutional Funds.
  
  - HOLA has consistently facilitated community engagement and helped to beautify and activate the Rampart neighborhood. In 2003, families were too scared to enter into the local park, but since HOLA partnered with LA City Recreation and Parks to bring unprecedented financial and programmatic resources, thousands of families now utilize Lafayette Park on a regular basis.",03 Teaching & mentorship,22 Art,,,,

Our thorough campaign work resulted in Councilman Bill Rosendahl putting our motion before the Los Angeles City Council where it is currently being studied by the Planning and Land Use Committee. And while we can't say that we have achieved full legalization yet, in creating the community model and approaching it from a grassroots level we've created momentum which cannot be stopped. <br><br>
  
  
  
  
  
  Our most important achievements are not measured in legislative changes but in the number of people we reach, teach, and impact. In that respect we have been enormously successful. In a short time we've connected with people all over the world through monthly workshops, mentoring sessions, honey bee rescues, education outreach, neighborhood council involvement and social media connections. Our proudest single achievement is creating a global community of conscientious, active urban beekeepers who now share HoneyLove's mission with an ever-growing audience.

  Human Resources was identified by the Los Angeles Weekly in 2012 as one of the city's ""most dynamic arts venues."" We foster active public appreciation of performative, participatory and multi-disciplinary art practices by encouraging maximum community access. Events are free or very low cost. Members of our broad community generate exhibitions, performances and readings - artists who attend our events are encouraged to bring proposals to directing members. Our programming procedures encourage direct conversation with artists, musicians and writers in order to educate our audiences about our mission. These conversations also shape our understanding of the needs of artists working in non-commercial and experimental paradigms. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Human Resources serves as an important point of convergence for diverse and sometimes disparate art communities. We offer regular platforms for conversation and idea-sharing in order to promote the sustainability of non-traditional art forms. We nurture the kinds of artistic intelligence produced by working closely with different artistic communities - such as that of experimental music and performance art. We have also collaborated with other art spaces and events, including Pacific Standard Time, Silvershed's Collective show, fundraisers and events for Les Figues Press and Darin Klein's Box of Books, and the Chinatown Perform!Now!

  <P>Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.<p>
  
  <P>Our success story: in the fall of 2012, Karen met Lola, a bright, kind-hearted, eager and willing third-grader, the type of student that inspires any teaching heart. As the first week of the school year unfolded, Karen observed Lola, despite her powers of persistence, struggle consistently with recalling/retrieving information that she needed to followed multi-step directions. <P>
  
  <P>Karen a veteran third grade teacher, knows that by third grade, kids start to take pride in â€œdoing things on their ownâ€ and too many reminders by a teacher elicit painful embarrassment. Fortunately, she had just participated in â€œStructuring the Learning Environmentâ€ a special ed professional development series offering strategies to help special needs kids get through â€œtasksâ€. Building on what was learned, she began to create work systems on strips of paper for Lola that broke done daily routines and academic situations into â€œone step at a time listsâ€ and added a little animal clip for Lola to move as she progressed through each step. Karen, in collaboration with Lola's Mom, Carrie, formalized these systems for Lola by posting them in her planner and empowering her to check off her tasks as she went - allowing her to feel far more in control and independent. <P>
  
  <P>It was almost magical: Lola went from being frozen to completely independent, with her â€œwork systemâ€ at hand. Building on Lolaâ€™s achievement, Karenâ€™s principal requested that she share her strategies with other teachers, who in turn successfully applied work systems with their struggling students. <P>
  
  <P>The recent course Karen had taken, coupled with the perfect timing of having Lola as student along with the professional development she shared with other teachers made Karen realize just how many kids would in the future, benefit tremendously by a ""work system"" like she had informally developed for Lola, and an idea took root: an App version.<P>",03 Teaching & mentorship, ,,,,

These include the L.A. Leadership Academy in Lincoln Heights in an exploration of the L.A. River; the Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale to uncover the social history of Compton's Richland Farms; Venice High School to examine the myth and reality of Venice; the Chinatown Service Centerâ€™s Youth Council to highlight the rich and diverse history of Chinatown, and Franklin High School to share the stories of the people, places and historical events that have shaped Highland Park.
  
  The award-winning Youth Voices program is a vital outreach component of KCETâ€™s Departures, a multimedia documentary series, community engagement tool, and digital literacy project that explores the social and cultural vitality of Los Angelesâ€™ diverse neighborhoods. Departures has received funding from non-profits and public and private agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Adobe Youth Voices, Boeing, the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, and the California Council for the Humanities.
    An important aspect of Departures Youth Voices is our website, where we have built an archive of all student generated media from each of our neighborhood documentaries. The Youth Voices Curriculum can be accessed through our website, allowing educators and youth advocates open source access to our lesson plans. 
  
  Specific achievements include when students from the L.A. Leadership Academy were selected to perform their songs and poetry at â€œCorrido of Los Angeles,â€ an event celebrating the bicentennial of the Mexican Revolution at the L.A. County Museum of Art. In the winning entries the students positioned themselves as agents of change in their neighborhood, working as a team looking to reclaim the streets and make them a better place.
  
  Another student producer, Mo Rahman, traveled to Washington, D.C. and took part in a panel discussion at the Silverdocs Festival where he shared his Youth Voices experience. He presented student produced work from the L.A. River installment, and discussed how the skills he learned offered new opportunities for his future. He, along with several other Youth Voices student producers, have continued their study of media, while others have had an opportunity to intern at KCET Departures.
  
  An on-going example of our achievements is how our work is advancing and evolving. Currently we are continuing our collaboration with The L.A. Leadership Academy, and developing new partnerships with two newly-established schools: ArtLAB and The L.A. River School at the Sotomayor Learning Academies in Glassell Park.

As a response to this, Keely Hopkins and Samuel Alleyne launched Youth 4C, a new initiative aimed at increasing leadership, advocacy, and volunteerism among youth.

  Youth 4C is a dynamic and rapidly growing initiative that already has two projects underway in the first few months of launching. Youth 4C has developed an entrepreneur curriculum for children aged 7-15 that will be implemented this summer at Los Angeles City College. Youth 4C has also partnered with the College of the Bahamas to develop and lead an international youth summit that will bring together youth from urban and rural areas to tackle top issues affecting their futures.

  The organizationâ€™s landmark project was the 2012 Performance and Public Art Festival, co-organized with the Getty Foundation under the umbrella of the major regionwide initiative, Pacific Standard Time: L.A. Art 1945-80. The 11-day festival featured new public artworks throughout the city; a dramatic sampling of the large-scale spectacles, expansive performances, and small-scale interventions that punctuated the history of postwar art in Los Angeles. In addition, new performances premiered each day, including outdoor visual spectacles, experimental theater and sound art, social and political interventions, and media art. A nightly after-party, Black Box, provided a space for socializing, and included surprise performances each evening.

The Forum has organized lectures, symposia, events, exhibitions, competitions, and publications throughout its history. We are a non-profit organization that operates outside of the realms of professional practice and architecture schools. Our members consist of architects, planners, engineers, designers, educators, students, artists, and other people interested in the built environment in Los Angeles.

  Our publication history includes a significant pamphlet series between 2003 and 2010 that included Dead Malls, Out the Window (LAX), Polar Inertia, After the City, This (Is How We Live), Pendulum Plane, and Meet the Nelsons. The series explored Los Angeles urban design and architecture through creative responses, such as comic book styles and fake screenplays, as well as through speculative architectural projects as part of the Forumâ€™s sponsorship of competitions. In addition, the Forum has published a quarterly newsletter since our founding that provides space for critical thinkers to write about Los Angeles. We have also published larger-scale books, including Experimental Architecture in Los Angeles (Rizzoli International) and Everyday Urbanism (Monacelli Press).
  
  The Forumâ€™s public events, including lectures and symposia, continue to play an active role in the identity of LA design. One of our most significant past events focused on the aftermath of the LA Uprisings in 1992, when we brought together our members and the National Organization of Minority Architects for the event â€œAlternative Disorders: On Designing Communities.â€ We also sponsor quarterly Pecha Kucha events for designers to share their work with the community, as well as a lecture series called â€œOut There Doing Itâ€ that spotlights emerging design practices and the â€œOn the Mapâ€ series that provides architectural tours of buildings given by the architects who designed them.
  
  In our 25-year history, we have sponsored design competitions to focus attention on opportunities for rethinking the vitality of urban LA. These have included Civic Innovations (1994), Dead Malls (2003), Liner (2008), and Dingbat 2.0 (2010). Our most recent competition on Dingbats focused on the reinvention of this classic LA housing prototype for a new generation of urban citizens, resulting in a forthcoming book and an exhibition of the competition entries. 
  
  The Forum continues to actively engage all of Los Angeles and has two exhibitions planned this summer for our space in the Woodbury University Hollywood gallery.

  As part of our community development work, LTSC has made significant efforts to revitalize Little Tokyo into a vibrant community. LTSC has worked in partnership with other entities to designate a major portion of Little Tokyo as a National Historic Landmark. LTSC has renovated and upgraded three buildings in the historic district:<br/><br/>
  
  *San Pedro Firm Building. This 1923 building was threatened with demolition by the City but quick action by LTSC and community advocates saved the building. After a $3 million renovation, it now provides 42 units of safe, clean, affordable housing to low-income seniors and other residents, and commercial space to longstanding and new small businesses. <br/><br/>
  
  *Old Union Church Building. Immediately next-door to the San Pedro Firm Building is the historic Old Union Church, one of the earliest Japanese American Christian church structures built in Los Angeles. In the 1970â€™s, the church congregation relocated and the aging building suffered in the ensuing years from neglect. Again LTSC led the effort to raise $4 million to bring this building back to life and now this once abandoned space is The Union Center for the Arts.
 
  *The Historic Far East Building with its famous Far East CafÃ© is located in the heart of the Little Tokyo Historic District, bearing witness to the birth, growth and development of what was, during its heyday in the 1920s and 30s, the largest Japanese American community in the mainland United States. After suffering severe damage during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the buildingâ€™s future was uncertain, possibly taking with it all of its history. LTSC was able to save the building to keep this part of Little Tokyoâ€™s history alive. 

  *Casa Heiwa. Additionally, in 1996 LTSC completed the first new family-oriented housing project to be built in Little Tokyo in over 70 years. 
  
  Through LTSCâ€™s community organizing efforts we have established relationships with Little Tokyo residents and have taught them to collectively and formally represent their concerns. Moreover, we have worked with residents to develop a model for community involvement in planning. With our support and guidance, the residents have lobbied for two crosswalks, a post office and helped successfully fight to preserve affordable housing at a 100-unit building.

  For ten years, M&A has transformed a parking lot in Silver Lake into an internationally-acclaimed center for materials research and artistic expression on an architectural scale exhibiting large-scale installations. M&A projects at this site are designed by artists and architects and built with volunteers from the community - winning three American Institute of Architects (AIA) awards, as well as other design awards and recognitions. M&A produced the inaugural performance for The Gettyâ€™s Pacific Standard Time with Judy Chicago - coordinating hands-on workshops for the public alongside the legendary artist to create an environment out of 25 tons of dry ice. The founder, Jenna Didier received the Neutra Spirit award 2010 and the Silver Lake History Collective award in 2011 for a lasting contribution to the cultural fabric of the Silver Lake district. 
  
  While M&A has been committed to working with â€œsustainableâ€ materials and environments long before the term was popular, projects that have specifically sought to bring public attention to environmental and sustainability issues include a pneumatically-operated origami robotic garden by Eddy Sykes and the community-designed Taco Garden which explored sustainable gardening techniques in an aquaponics garden that re-circulated rainwater for growing tilapia and other fish taco ingredientsâ€”onions, cilantro and tomatoes.
  
  f hands-on bilingual workshops commissioned by the Los Angeles Environmental Affairs Department, M&A managed the successful transformation of another blighted parking lot into a rainwater capturing surface with edible perimeter plantings tended by grateful mixed- use building residents and employees. Some benefits were: decreases in stormwater runoff from the parking lot, decreases in heat island effect, increases in social engagement between building residents and employees working downstairs.

  Research conducted by the US Forest Service, the national new tree mortality rate is between 10% and 12%. MTLAâ€™s mortality rate is half the national average at 4% and 5%. 
  
  A National Model
  
  
  The US Forest Service conducted a national study of large municipal tree planting programs in 2010/11 and found Million Trees LA to be a top model.

The guiding vision for the $135 million NHM Next Campaign is to bring the Museumâ€™s most important collections and ambitious discoveries out of our science labs to create new visitor experiences that explore the â€œbig pictureâ€ of life on our planet and the interrelatedness of our natural and cultural worlds. We are only four months away from completion of this historic transformation. NHM Next is changing the way we can educate our visitor base. Each year, 200,000 visitors from local schools visit the Museum â€“ more than a quarter of all the students in LAUSD â€“ free of charge. NHM has the most diverse, broadest visitor base of any comparable museum in the Western U.S.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Among the seven major exhibitions that comprise NHM Next are the NHM Nature Gardens and Nature Lab. These exhibits form an expansive indoor-outdoor interface with the urban wildlife of Los Angeles, a site where visitors and researchers can study biodiversity and environmental change as it happens. Visitors will be able to observe and take part in the scientific process, and to learn valuable lessons about our environment. The Nature Lab will be the Museumâ€™s center for Citizen Science. It is a hub of nature investigation and scientific research outfitted with interactive media and tactile â€œhands-onâ€ experiences to connect the Museumâ€™s exhibits and collections indoors to the â€œraw materialâ€ visitors encounter outdoors. The exhibit will invite visitors to experience the cityâ€™s rich biodiversity and give them a way to contribute to real, ongoing study of our urban ecosystem. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In addition to the massive physical accomplishments at the Museum, NHM has a team of dozens of researchers, in fields ranging from archaeology to entomology. These world-class researchers are contributing to academic and scientific discourse every day. NHM researchers are frequently published in the highest echelon of scientific journals. Some recent, notable accomplishments from the Museumâ€™s research and collections department include Project 23, a massive, historic discovery of thousands of Ice-age fossils operating in the public eye in Rancho La Brea, in the heart of Mid-City Los Angeles; an NSF-funded biodiversity inventory in Costa Rica led by NHM Entomologist Dr. Brian Brown; and the â€œPregnant Plesiosaurâ€ displayed in NHMâ€™s new Dinosaur Hall â€“ NHM paleontologists discovered a perfectly preserved plesiosaur (a 72 million year-old marine reptile) with a fetus inside, that has yielded tremendous scientific knowledge about live birth in these ancient reptiles.

  <p>CCIP launched in April 2012, and in our first year we have assembled a team of staff, interns, advisors, and partners that are dedicated to supporting CCIP in achieving long-term sustainability and changing the way California local governments work in order to be more responsive to their residents, enhancing social connectedness..</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Major project accomplishments include:</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>- In 2012, Vallejo, California launched the first city-wide participatory budgeting process in the United States. The City of Vallejo will invite residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue. Through a year-long PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens. CCIP serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>- In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of methodologies -- from conversations with experts on networks and city administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California. Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>",19 Voting & civic engagement, ,,,,

Green Dotâ€™s dramatic expansion has been fueled by a commitment to â€˜doing what it takesâ€™ to break down the barriers that prevent students from thriving. Our first five schools were located throughout Los Angeles, with an emphasis on diverse neighborhoods that were underserved by traditional public schools. In 2012, those schools scored an average 764 on the Academic Performance Index (API), Californiaâ€™s primary measure of accountability; higher than both district and state averages. The schools are among the highest performing â€˜minorityâ€™ schools in California.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>In 2008, in collaboration with teachers and the community, Green Dot won control of Alain Leroy Locke High School, one of the lowest-achieving schools in the nation. Four years into the transformation, the Locke schools scored over 600 API compared to a pre-transformation score of 511. In 2010, Green Dot launched a new strategy to address the chronic attainment levels of incoming 9th graders through the opening of high-quality middle schools, two the result of a takeover of Henry Clay Middle School, ranked as the worst middle school in California. Concurrently, LAUSD invited us to take over David Starr Jordan High School, located in the heart of the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts.

  In 2009 our first major success was passing LAUSDâ€™s historic Public School Choice resolution. It opened up hundreds of failing and newly constructed campuses for bidding by quality charter school operators, teachers, and other non-profits.
  
  
  
  
  
  We ran a grassroots campaign that generated over 4,000 supportive postcards from parents and then organized 3,000 parents for a rally on the day of the vote. 
  
  
  
  
  
  When we passed LAUSDâ€™s Public School Choice policy we gave birth to the parent empowerment movement.
  
  
  
  
  
  The Parent Trigger Law
  
  
  
  
  
  In January 2010 we passed Californiaâ€™s Parent Trigger law â€“ a concept far more powerful than Public School Choice. The law empowers a majority of parents at failing schools to transform them. 
  
  
  
  
  
  The Parent Trigger law has reframed the public debate on the role organized and empowered parents can play in public school reform. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Comptonâ€™s McKinley Elementary School Campaign
  
  
  
  
  
  In December 2010 we helped parents at McKinley Elementary School in Compton, CA become the first to successfully use the Parent Trigger law by submitting signatures of over 61% of their schoolâ€™s parents. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Parents Union Chapters and Policy Training
  
  
  
  
  
  Parents Union Chapters are dedicated to improving educational outcomes at local schools through organizing and activism. A major project we undertake with each chapter is to provide parents comprehensive education policy training to help them formally evaluate the strengths and weaknesses within their schools. 
  
  
  
  
  
  â€œParent Power Expressâ€ Bus Tour
  
  
  
  
  
  In September 2011, our â€œParent Power Expressâ€ bus tour made stops at our Los Angeles area chapters before ending in Sacramento. The tour showcased the incredible, important organizing work Parents Union Chapters are doing to transform their childrenâ€™s under-performing schools through the Parent Trigger law.
  
  
  It was a hugely successful media campaign that promoted the continued expansion of growing parent empowerment movement. It proved that the work we started in L.A is on the cutting edge of the most dynamic school transformation movements in the country. 
  
  
  Parent Trigger Law Regulations
  
  
  In 2011, we completed a campaign to pass final State Board of Education Parent Trigger law regulations. We mobilized a powerful grassroots movement and generated supportive editorials from almost every major newspaper in California.

  In January 2012, parents launched the nationâ€™s 2nd Parent Trigger campaign. In January 2013 the Adelanto School Board finally complied with two court orders. This is the first time in the United States a school board voted to approve Parent Trigger implementation. 
  
  
  LAUSDâ€™s 24th Street Elementary School
  
  
  In January the 24th Street Elementary Parents Union Chapter launched the first Parent Trigger campaign at an LAUSD school. 69% of school parents signed the petition.

  In 2010, Pasadena Arts Council began conversations local leaders on the legacy and potential of Southern Californiaâ€™s arts and science assets â€“ assets, it was agreed, that distinguish the area in a unique way on a national basis and provide a framework for thinking about future economic and cultural development. These conversations led to the notion of a â€œvision summit,â€ gathering together community leaders for an extended version of this conversation. Later that year, a number of institutional and corporate leaders were invited to explore ideas for tapping the full potential of the unique fabric of arts and science. It was proposed that these intellectual and institutional assets define the region as a place where ideas and creativity abound, and that they reflect an unharnessed regional and national identity that can leverage the local economy, its cultural tourism, and its citizensâ€™ sense of pride and belonging. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Pasadena Arts Council is also very proud of its EMERGE fiscal sponsorship program. This cultural entrepreneurship program currently incubates 60 individual projects and emerging organizations, offering them the ability to seek funding through fiscal sponsorship, and supporting participants during a crucial stage. It provides an opportunity to develop a project and determine its trajectory with the guidance and oversight of an established nonprofit.â€‚ EMERGE supports artists who are launching new endeavors, those who are in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) determination, and also projects and programs that prefer to remain fiscally sponsored, making use of PACâ€™s nonprofit infrastructure to support their ongoing efforts. In FY 2013, PAC helped these projects raise over $800,000 and serve over 43,000 people, including 12,000 young people, through after-school art and music programs, theater, dance and music performances, visual art exhibitions, public art commissions, literary and cultural festivals, photography and film projects and many other diverse, artist-driven projects throughout Southern California.

  <blockquote>""My mom struggled to make ends meet. I had no sense of direction. I began using drugs and stealing to find happiness. I got caught and was referred to Bresee, where my perspective on life changed. I took anger management classes and met weekly with my counselor Rene who helped me to look at life differently. Bresee gave me this sense of accomplishment-something I had never felt before. One day Rene told me about a job opening at Bresee. I took the job and began working with first-time offenders, opening Bresee's first community service program. This was the first real job I had ever had. I worked part-time at Bresee, went to community college, and eventually transferred to UCLA. With the help of Bresee and their scholarship opportunity I graduated - something unimaginable during my younger days. Without Bresee's financial and emotional help I never would have gotten this far.""</blockquote></p>",03 Teaching & mentorship,01 STEM & Digital literacy,Duplicate,,,

Since its founding, PFLA has staged a series of provocative events in diverse locations in the city.
  
  
  
  
  
  Hungry Urbanism
  
  
  In this panel discussion series taking place over 4 months, PFLA engaged diverse thinkers to help look at the food system as an urban planning/design issue. The series of four discussions were staged at locations including Habeas Lounge and Southern California Institute of Architecture, the MAK Center in West Hollywood, and the Watts Labor Community Action Committee in Watts. The discussions tackled a range of topics including the role of local urban planning in the context of a global food system, a survey of urban food practices, the cultural conditions of health in South LA, and proposals for an urban farm in Watts.
  
  
  
  
  
  Fragrant Flavor Freeze
  
  
  Six local chefs were asked to create ice cream featuring a local, seasonal herb for a tasting event on Fatherâ€™s Day. Visitors were invited to sample, smell, touch, taste the herb and the ice cream on which it was based. The goal of the event was to celebrate flavor and local, seasonal ingredients. Participants were challenged to reconnect multiple senses to the experience of taste.
  
  
  
  
  
  Sage Table
  
  
  For an exhibition of creative family practices with Broodwork at Otis College of Art & Design, PFLA created the â€œSage Table.â€ This table was an apothecary of sorts, cataloguing 17 types of local sage in a unique table. The tabletop contained the sage varieties as well as a series of seeds for collection and home planting. Visitors were invited to sow the seeds with pots and organic soil that were provided. The table also housed a variety of reference materials and didactic information about the sage so common in California.
  
  
  
  
  
  Micheltorena Tree Planting
  
  
  With a grant from Closed on Mondays, PFLA was able to provide materials and labor for a tree planting at Micheltorena School in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles. As part of the schoolâ€™s community work day and the United States Green Building Councilâ€™s day of service, PFLA engaged a school mission to transform asphalt to permeable surface and fruit trees. A Guava Tree was planted in the playground, and has grown since we implemented the project.
  
  
  
  
  
  Mudtown Farms
  
  
  PFLA has been engaged with Mudtown Farm, an initiative of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. We have been involved with a series of events for this project. With a successful Prop 84 grant of nearly $5 million, PFLA has staged tours, cross promoted and advocated for the realization of this project.
  
  
  
  
  
  In addition to these past events, the Potluck Truck is something we have discussed for quite a while. Currently, events are being planned around the conflict between indigenous Mexican farmers and the Monsanto Corporation as big agriculture attempts to take over the Mexican production of corn.",10 Access to healthy food, ,,,,

The campaign focused on obtaining incentives for increased affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.
  
  
  
  
  
  Public Counsel won a preliminary injunction this year, preventing the State from taking $38 million in affordable housing funds from the LA County Housing Authority. Acting on behalf of the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing, we protected these funds that are designated for affordable housing for low-income seniors, people who are homeless, families, and transition-age youth within 15 miles of the City of Industry, which includes many areas around transit.
  
  
  
  
  
  Our staff attorneys led a team of lawyers in reaching an agreement, in 2011, with the developer of the Lorenzo project in South LA, in which the developer agreed to concessions worth $9.5 million. The Lorenzo project is the largest of its kind along the cityâ€™s planned Expo Line extension. The agreement delivered a wide range of community benefits, including 7,500 square feet, rent free, dedicated to community-based health care services, and 5% of the units built to be made affordable to people who earn less than 50% of the area median income.
  
  
  
  
  
  With Public Counselâ€™s leadership, the Alliance for Community Transit-Los Angeles engaged in a strategic planning process; finalized its vision, mission, and principles; solidified its membership base of 20 diverse organizations; strengthened its infrastructure; and developed the key parameters of a citywide equitable TOD campaign.
  
  
  
  
  
  Public Counsel represented the interests of low-income tenants whose affordable housing was at risk of being lost in Los Angelesâ€™ rapidly gentrifying coastal zone, which already had a limited supply of affordable housing. In 2011, we reached a historic settlement with HUD and the owners of the Holiday Venice apartment complex that provides for 20 years of affordability provisions and protects current tenants from being displaced. 
  
  
  
  
  
  We are engaged in a long-term campaign in the southeast cities (Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, and South Gate) to increase familiesâ€™ access to child care and green space through changes to those citiesâ€™ general plans and zoning codes.

The academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students, families and schools define and address challenges related to college going and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes. Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the country. Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the Centerâ€™s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed â€“ I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide where to go. Weâ€™ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting the program in 2005. The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education) program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills. The third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours â€“ in cyberspace! We partnered with USCâ€™s Game Innovation Lab and students from Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.",02 College prep, ,,,,

However, while 86% of students passed their science exam, only 14% of students passed in mathematics.

  <p>Economic Development: For nearly 20 years, SBCC's career training and placement programs have opened up access to living-wage employment for residents of low-income communities. Over the past 5 or more years, these programs have provided training and placement assistance to more than 150 individuals per year in employment sectors including energy, renewables, digital arts and media, film and video production, and K-12 teaching. Placement rates exceed 75%, and 24-month community college completion and transfer rates have been as high as 90% (as compared to statewide, 6-year rates of less than 30%).</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>SBCC has adapted this approach to youth entrepreneurship with our innovative Streetcraft LA project, which supports at-risk youth as they develop and market their own lines of apparel and accessories. Additional projects in community-based agriculture, food service, and neighborhood financial services are currently in development.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Finally, SBCC has used our community organizing project's extensive reach into low-income, immigrant-dense communities to launch a highly successful Deferred Action initiative, placing young adults on the path toward legal residency and full participation in the legitimate economy.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Healthy Childhood and Early Education: SBCC's Community Doula program mobilizes community advocates for women during pregnancy, birthing, and in the post-partum months. These doulas help new mothers navigate the medical system, form healthy attachments with their infants, promote good nutrition and breastfeeding, and engage from birth onwards in activities that support children's cognitive, social and emotional development. The program has proven effective at eliminating infant mortality, significantly increasing rates of breastfeeding, and significantly reducing numbers of low-weight births.</p>
  
  
  <p>Our Preschool Without Walls program works with families in these communities to address critical gaps in early learning and preschool resources. PWW brings early learning experiences to more than 500 parents and children in community institutions and locations that serve as learning and development resources. In homes and neighborhoods, parks, libraries, and community centers, the program engages parents and children in a shared early learning experience leading to improved child development and school readiness through supporting parents' role as their children's primary educators.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>In all of our work, our primary commitment is to develop community capacity to address education, economic development, and other issues in an ongoing way. Provision of high-quality direct services is necessary, but does not go far enough: what is needed is the growth of leadership and ownership within communities themselves to carry these initiatives forward on a self-sufficient, sustainable basis.</p>",19 Voting & civic engagement, ,Duplicate,,,

The program has been meeting the many economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully adjusting to changes in the area since 194.
  
  
  
  
  
  In the past few years, the program has also sought to increase linkages between different parts of society. Baldwin Park and surrounding cities have had some issues with having government, business, organizations, and the population working together such as with redevelopment issues. 
  
  
  
  
  
  An example is the start of the Cesar Chavez Interfaith Breakfast, which for the first time brought together community leaders, business owners, labor leaders, clergy from several denominations, public sector employees, and politicians together in a non-formal gathering. The event allows people to meet others while also hearing different perspectives, such as a rabbi who worked with Cesar Chavez to a local graduate who has become principal of one of the cityâ€™s high schools. Attendees leave with new contacts and possibilities.
  
  
  
  
  
  There has been great success in having community voices heard with more influence at city hall. After a fatal traffic accident, the program teamed with LA Voice and other congregations to seek a solution to an ongoing danger. This combined campaign led to a rapid decision by the city to install a new traffic light, which is now in service. The campaign prompted local officials to act far faster than normal.
  
  
  
  
  
  An ongoing success has been getting community members much more involved in local issues. An example is the cityâ€™s study of whether to retain the local police department or contract with the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department. Now, community members are attending hearings, giving their opinions and staying informed of events in the debate. In previous years this process would largely have been ignored by the public and not been influenced by their views. The local officials now know their decisions are being monitored. Creating public accountability is a major gain for this area.
  
  
  
  
  
  A significant achievement has been making connections to more effectively serve those in need, something that before was more provincial. The Social Services program has adjusted the annual Thanksgiving food drive to partner with the school district and their family liaison officers to identify people in need. This has led to a much better evaluation of the needs of the community and reduced fraud. Now, verified families in need have Thanksgiving food boxes delivered to their homes. This partnership is helping both parties ensure aid is effective to maximize results. 
  
  
  
  
  
  The Social Services program has been developing greater and deeper linkages in the community to provide better delivery of resources. This project will take this process even further to yield wonderful dividends. The foundation of social connectedness has been established; now, the program looks to grow the structure.",03 Teaching & mentorship, ,,,,

  Kayla, Class of 2013: â€œStep Up has shaped who I am today. Iâ€™ve learned to speak my mind and become an independent woman and a leader. After graduation, I plan to go on to college and continue my journey, to try out all of the great things that the world has to offer me. I would definitely encourage other girls to join Step Up. Step Up is a family you build, and it will only make you stronger.â€
  
  
  
  
  
  Yosselin, Kenyan College Class of 2015: At 10 years old, Yosselin left El Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles and a troublesome period of her life began. She was skipping a lot of school and got involved with a gang. She turned a corner her freshman year of high school when she joined Step Up. Through Step Up, she was able to imagine a better life for herself for the first time. â€œMy best moment with Step Up has been interviewing Jane Wurwand, founder of Dermalogica, and having been able to visit her office and see her in action, running her company. This is when I realized that school was very important and I had to get serious. In 9th grade, Step Up not only became my escape, it became my new family. It has been the influence of so many strong successful women that have kept me working hard. It has been the Step Up college tours, internships, and my Step Up mentors that have helped me envision the future I know now I am capable of achieving. Through Step Up, I discovered my passion for writing and my potential to thrive in college.â€
  
  
  
  
  
  Jaâ€™Nai, Gettysburg College Class of 2016 â€œBy participating in Step Up they taught me all about the business world and what I needed to do to be successful in it. In addition, it taught me exactly what my working style is and helped guide me in my search of what career I may want to pursue in the future by providing me with several exceptional mentors who are successful businesswoman. Through this program I was also able to obtain an internship at The JAR Group. I want to be a writer when I get older so my internship really helps me exercise my skills, since I spend most of my time finding content and sampling copies to go along with it. The Step Up program has given me the opportunity to have a voice.â€",03 Teaching & mentorship, ,,,,

SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organizationâ€™s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth. In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasnâ€™t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youth-led micro ventures. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Streetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation. Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youthâ€™s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%.",24 Transportation, ,,,,

Weâ€™re challenging ourselves to fully consider the costs and value of things that are too-often omitted in the conversation: labor, modern manufacturing processes, etc. It is without a doubt that we will need to rely on creative resource gathering, careful proportioning, DIY processes, and the generosity of friends and strangers to realize a 69Â¢ Only store.""",22 Art,23 Creative economy,,,,

Our results speak for themselves: Of our most recent class, 94% have graduated from high school, and 96% of those are in college. This more than doubles the average graduation rates that typically characterize these depressed areas. Program-wide, 97% percent of Dreamers report that IHADLA is like a â€œsecond familyâ€ to them and Ninety-eight percent of Dreamers feel that their mentor will be there for them â€œno matter whatâ€ and can trust them with their problems.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Additionally, in 2011, IHADLA received the FBI Directorâ€™s Community Leadership Award for outstanding service to the community. Only one organization nationally is honored each year. We were thereafter able to forge a partnership with the FBI, and were able to match many of our Dreamers with FBI mentors. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Each of our current classes has achievements from this year which exemplify the success of our program overall:
  
  
  
  
  
  In 2002, IHADLA adopted an entire grade level of almost 150 first grade students from Murchison Elementary School. Almost all of these students lived in the Ramona Gardens Projects in East LA, and many still do. These Dreamers are now on the eve of their high school graduation. Eighty-three percent of our graduating Dreamers from this class will be attending college, and that number will grow next year when our second year seniors graduate as well. Colleges that Dreamers will be attending include: UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, USC, UCLA, Stanford University, Ithaca University, a host of Cal States throughout California, and many, many more. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Adopted back to back in 2006 and 2007, IHADLA has two grades of Dreamers in Inglewood. This year, we are proud to report that these middle-school Dreamers are performing better than their peers on the California English Language Development Test. Seventy-one percent of Dreamers were rated as â€œearly advancedâ€ or â€œadvancedâ€, compared with only 39% of their peers. These Dreamers continue to flourish academically, with 66% improving their grade point averages this year overall. Despite turbulence within the Inglewood school district, the majority of our Dreamers have above a 3.0 GPA, and many of those below are Dreamers in our special education program.
  
  
  
  
  
  Our newest group of third grade Dreamers have not only melted our hearts, but inspired our organization as a whole. These children come from extraordinary circumstances, including domestic violence, familial gang membership, and unbelievable scenarios of poverty. Despite it all, these children are well on their way to becoming the future leaders of our society. Over the course of IHADLAâ€™s first six months of programming, these Dreamers went from 32% only passing their quarterly assessments to 62% at advanced/proficient level.</p>",03 Teaching & mentorship, ,Duplicate,,,

If violence is left unchallenged and unchecked in the microcosm of the dating scene and the family home, then it will mushroom into larger conflicts. Without intervention, individuals caught in the cycle of abuse may be at risk for death, disability, injury, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Raising consciousness to the importance of healthy relationships its correlation to a healthy community and the responsibility that each and every one of us has to make sure our relationships and the ones around us are worthy, good and functioning, is one of our most important achievements.</p>

  <p>Participants of the program articulate their success far better than we can:
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>All of Relationships 101 was very interesting, but my favorite part was acting out the different situations, they put everyday life into a perspective, and showed where you can make clear choices, you can chose NOT to argue and make things worse, by using I messages, saying how you feel, I feel this, and I feel that or I donâ€™t like that, that makes me feel bad â€¦.that really helped !!!</p>

  <p>I feel like I can handle certain situations in my relationships better than I did before. I feel better knowing that it isnâ€™t bad to stand up for yourself or do what you think is right, even if it is going against your boyfriend or girlfriend. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, we are all worthy of a healthy relationship! </p>

  <p>I learned in relationships 101 that anything that happens to us in the real world looks better when we act it out. This program, helped me with a lot of frustrations. I learned to collaborate, be respectful, responsible, and ready. I am so happy I had the opportunity to realize that you need to think twice about what we really go through and how to work things out with every human being in the world. I learned how to accept things that I canâ€™t change and to change the things I can. </p>

We are the only organization in Los Angeles that focuses exclusively on environmental education for young children during their most impressionable years: birth through age 8. CNI works with more than 100 schools, early-education centers and social service agencies to serve 15,000 children each year. We focus on reaching children in underserved communities to share with them the wonder of nature as a tool for academic achievement, personal growth, and community building.
  
  
  CNI was founded in 1985 by three mothers who were anxious to find ways to teach young children about nature outside of the classroom. We have been at the forefront of the movement to connect children with nature ever since. The organization was run by a core group of volunteers that led young families on walks at area parks and beaches. After the Los Angeles riots in 1992, motivated by the call for equity, justice and inclusion, CNI launched the outreach Nature Discovery Program to give children from low-income neighborhoods and academically low-ranking schools of Los Angeles the opportunity to learn science, math and reading skills through experiences with the natural world. In 2000, CNI added a traveling classroom called the WonderMobile to the program (a visit that includes live animals and various natural artifacts).
  
  
  In 2010, CNI became the ""environmental arm"" of the Magnolia Place Family Center. As part of the groundbreaking Magnolia Community Initiative, CNI actively collaborates within a network of more than 70 service providers to improve the quality of life, including educational outcomes, for the 100,000 people living within a 500-block radius of the Center. CNI offers a wide range of hands-on activities for families living in West Adams, Pico-Union, and the North Figueroa Corridor. These communities represent some of Los Angeles County's most challenged neighborhoods with historically low educational access and a high rate of families living at or below the federal poverty level. We have served more than 350,000 children, their parents, and teachers in the greater Los Angeles area since we started, and show no signs of slowing down. 
  
  
  Joining MCI gave CNI the latitude and capability to embark on the leadership role for ExN:LA, a collaboration modeled on MCI and focused on bringing continuous, high-quality environmental education to schools throughout Los Angeles. Now in its second year, ExN:LA has grown to include the entire 2nd and 3rd grades at 2 schools, 6 partner organizations and the MCI network of collaborators and community. ExN:LA is part of national Education by Nature umbrella with iterations throughout California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, each of which is designed to meet the specific needs of its community, and to share best practices and ideas with each other",03 Teaching & mentorship,14 Air and water,,,,

We were accused of perpetuating homelessness, encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having fought city hall and survived. From that point forward we have only gotten braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of people like us in the community who wanted to do something ""good"" but didn't know where to begin. We have since fought any number of running battles just to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians and other ""social service agencies,"" and, just two years ago against a company which sued us for creating ""a public and a private nuisance."" When that happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice. We are now stronger and more effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still. We serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night. We have two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary. As far as we know, no other ragtag grass-roots organization formed to help the homeless has lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support. And yet we are still at the takeoff point, in that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea as to how we can reach deeper into the community and how we can avail ourselves of its strength to do more for the weakest among us.",09 Homelessness,10 Access to healthy food,,,,

Our long-term arts programs reach communities and students who otherwise lack access to the arts, proven to be one of the most effective ways to engage teenagers in their education and community. Our professional artists teach real-world skills needed in todayâ€™s creative economy, and impart a sense of confidence and purpose that leads to graduating from high school with a plan for the future. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Highlights of our recent achievements include:
  
  
  
  
  
  Responding to an increasingly urgent need to address the high school dropout crisis, The HeArt Project partnered with the LA County Office of Education to open the Hollywood Media Arts Academy (HMAA), an alternative arts high school for students at high risk of dropping out. The Academy celebrated its 2nd anniversary in August 2012.
  
  
  
  
  
  An important measure of the success is how many students advance from Level 1 to Level 2 and participate and complete HPâ€™s advanced levels. In the past two years, HP has had its largest cohorts ever participate in these advanced levels, and this year, for the first time, all Level 2 arts residency students applied for Level 3 summer arts scholarships.

Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different ""node"" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles. For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region. Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day). A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times. </p>

Many of its core ideas have been proven successful â€“ though, never quite in this dynamic combination. L.A. Kitchen is the latest venture of Robert Egger, the author of the award winning book â€œBegging for Change, The Dollars and Sense of Making Nonprofits Responsive, Efficient and Rewarding for Allâ€ and the pioneering creator of D.C. Central Kitchen, The Campus Kitchens Project, and CForward.
  
  
  
  
  
  D.C. Central Kitchen, founded in Washington, D.C. in 1989, is now a thriving $11 million nonprofit with a $6 million social enterprise portfolio. Egger created DCCK to turn leftover food into balanced meals in a â€˜central kitchenâ€™ that could in turn deliver them to 100 other nonprofits that were spending too much for substandard meals. There, he launched a culinary training program that brought in some of the cityâ€™s toughest cases â€“ men and women written off as hopeless, helpless, or both â€“ and prepared them for lasting careers. Since 2008, DCCKâ€™s 370 culinary graduates have averaged a job placement rate of 90%, despite the weak economy, and are 96% less likely to return to prison than ex-offenders nationwide. Eggerâ€™s results inspire 14,000 individuals to contribute their time and effort as volunteers to DC Central Kitchen each year.
  
  
  
  
  
  Egger launched The Campus Kitchens Project in 2001, because he saw a generation of young people dedicated to community service, but few nonprofits capable of maximizing their tremendous potential. Today, there are 34 CKP sites in 20 states across America, led by 5,000 tireless student volunteers who turned idle college and high school dining halls and cafeteria leftovers into new tools in the fight against hunger. In addition to preparing meals, CKP is preparing a new generation of community leaders. In 2012, 45% of CKPâ€™s student volunteers reported that their experiences had changed their entire career path, opening their eyes to new needs and new opportunities. 
  
  
  
  
  
  His work in Washington earned him numerous accolades and awards, including being named an Oprah Angel, the James Beard Humanitarian of the Year and a Washingtonian of the Year.
  
  
  
  
  
  In 2006, Egger Co-Convened the first Nonprofit Congress, and in 2011, he launched CForward, Americaâ€™s first Political Action Committee for nonprofits. Nonprofits comprise 10% of the US economy and 10% of the American workforce, but they speak with no common voice in our electoral process. In 2012, CForward made history by endorsing 8 candidates, representing both major parties, who had strong, clear plans for strengthening nonprofits and their role in solving key problems. Most won. This work also earned him a spot on the â€œTop 50 Most Influential Nonprofit leadersâ€ four years in a row.
  
  
  
  
  
  Now, Eggerâ€™s energy, experience, and entrepreneurial spirit are here in the region where he grew up in the 1960â€™s and 70â€™s, with an added focus on fighting the needless waste of fresh produce and strengthening our senior citizens.

In addition to School Fuel, we have made three significant investments in LAUSD to date.
  
  
  
  
  
  ARTS MATTER: is an unprecedented campaign to revitalize arts education in the nationâ€™s second largest school district. The campaign has been developed to drive public awareness for the critical role of arts education in public schools. By bringing together leading contemporary artists, including Barbara Kruger and John Baldessari, as well as Los Angeles entertainment, civic, and education leaders, Arts Matter is focused on rebuilding arts education in the creative capital of the world. The Los Angeles Fund for Public Education was inspired to spearhead this initiative to address the creativity crisis existing in Los Angeles public schools. Today, only 2% of all instructional time is devoted to the arts in L.A. elementary schools. The purpose of Arts Matter is to develop a system that integrates arts instruction with traditional core subjects to dramatically increase creative thinking and learning for all students. All proceeds raised throughout Arts Matter will directly support an innovative R&D fund to develop arts integration programs in L.A. public schools. In addition to the successful awareness campaign, the fund raised over $850,000 to fund multi-year arts integration programs.
  
  
  
  
  
  ANTI-BULLYING CAMPAIGN
  
  
  Bullying is a pervasive problem in our schools with 71 percent of students report bullying as an on-going problem. Studies have linked bullying with anxiety, depression, and lower academic achievement. We realized that in order to create a safe school environment where every student feels free to pursue their dreams without the fear of harassment or intimidation, students must take personal responsibility and show courage to stop bullying when they see it. When individual students stand up to bullying, they can ignite a cultural change school-wide. Together with LAUSD, the LA Fund brought together close to 7,000 students from 49 different schools to the Nokia Theatre for a screening of the documentary â€œBullyâ€ followed by a townhall discussion. The largest gathering of youth against bullying in California, the students that attended were given the inspiration to be the change agents to combat bullying on their campuses. The LA Fund will be providing anti-bullying grants to further support schools in their cultural transformation.
  
  
  
  
  
  BLENDED LEARNING: We have established three different exemplar â€œblended learningâ€ programs that integrate online curriculum with traditional teacher-led classroom instruction. Our programs are pilots to create new instructional models to support LAUSD in its bold initiative to cross the digital divide for every student through the use of tablet computers.

And thrdPlace has achieve all of this with a limited investment...just $45K. </p><p>In January 2012, the two co-founders were accepted to startup accelerator StartEngine (www.StartEngine.com). In March 2012, thrdPlace sold its first, pilot services to Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods used thrdPlace to manage an international, workforce volunteer campaign across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. To execute that campaign, Whole Foods identified, vetted and collaborated with over 200 Non Profits all on thrdPlace. </p><p>Since the pilot, thrdPlace has secured technology and distribution partnerships with ESRI and ADi Global.

ESRI is contracted to provide mapping and data analytics software to thrdPlace as well as distirbute thrdPlace to its existing clients. Similarly, ADi Global (www.ADi.com) is contracted to distribute thrdPlace to its existing clients. ADi is a global leader in supply chain and philanthropic efficiencies. Their 300K clients around the globe face the same challenges in community outreach as ESRIâ€™s clients. ADi, therefore, integrates thrdPlace into its salesforce and distribute thrdPlace on our behalf.</p><p>Furthermore, HUB Los Angeles (www.theHUBLA.com) invited thrdPlace and its co-founders to be founding members in its membership club.

The first, Underground Undergrads: UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012â€“2013 academic school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for immigrant students across the country. 
  
  
  
  
  
  The Labor Center engages in other activities to address the needs of undocumented immigrant youth, including hosting Dream Summer, the first national internship program for undocumented students.

We start with the communityâ€™s understanding of their problems and engage the community in addressing these issues. We organize block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood and bring this network together. We do this through reflection, action, analysis and start again with each phase bringing new information. Through this process community members learn to negotiate and prioritize their demands amongst themselves. Our organizing campaigns as identified by our community members include the following: preservation of healthy affordable housing; the right to clean water; the right to clean air; and the right to safe and healthy neighborhoods.

We have seen tremendous results in our work together over these past two years:
  
  
  
  
  
  â€¢ Leadership: Over 125 leaders from a broad cross-section of nonprofit, public, and philanthropic organizations, including the Mayor of LA and all 5 of our County Supervisors, signed onto the Home For Good plan.
  
  
  
  
  
  â€¢ Funding: $5 million from 16 private funders was leveraged to secure $100 million from 7 public funders, creating the first ever Funders Collaborative for permanent supportive housing in LA County.
  
  
  
  
  
  â€¢ Awareness: Over 20,000 volunteers have participated in HomeWalk, an annual 5k to end homelessness.
  
  
  
  
  
  â€¢ Systems Change: The time it takes for a homeless veteran to move from the street into a home was reduced by 2 months.
  
  
  
  
  
  â€¢ Housing: Well over 5,000 chronically homeless persons as well as an additional 2,000 homeless veterans were permanently housed.

In my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape architecture to urban design and cross-disciplinary systems with locations in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities. When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.
  
  
  In the Yongsan Park Masterplan, we proposed a project to ecologically regenerate an urban site that had been used as a military base for more than 100 years. Its location in central Seoul, as well as its proximity to Old Seoul eventually distorted its natural axis. The site needed to incorporate the historical situations of the Second World War, the Korean War, and the societal atmosphere which Korea was forced to face. Its solution demanded research about the ecology and sustainability inherent to the site. UNITEDLAB was fortunate enough to receive the ASLA Professional Award and an AIA LA Award for this project.
  
  
  More recently, I developed a research project called â€˜Los Angeles Affordable Apartments,â€™ a multi-unit residential prototype based on traditional village housing schemes.

Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life. Wonder is now on a healthy path and thriving. In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. 
  
  
  Wonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors. During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons. YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends. The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events. YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%. Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors. In addition, grades are showing improvement.
  
  
  YW has expanded its program throughout the community. YW community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program. YW now has two programs: (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys. Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools. In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gang-prevention units.

Law enforcement officials are thrilled by the reduced crime statistics, citing that there has not been a single homicide in the Watts housing developments since August 2011. Community members have reported that residents are now feeling more safe to travel and frequent stores within their community, and there have been notable decreases in youth gang membership and activity. While we are proud of our work in Watts, the Urban Peace program has also had a profound effect in improving community safety throughout Los Angeles.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Over the past 12 years, Urban Peace has established unprecedented partnerships between gang intervention workers and law enforcement throughout Los Angeles, resulting in the lowest crime rates since the 1960â€™s. Since 2006, gang related crimes have been reduced by 32% and the number of shots fired within Los Angles has decreased from 3,288 to 1,723, representing a 52% reduction. Overall, the crime rate is at a historical low in both the City and the County of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck credits Urban Peaceâ€™s work with contributing to this historic decline. Former LAPD Chief William Bratton hails our success: â€œThe Advancement Project has been a force of nature. They have changed the way things are done in Los Angeles on gangs.â€ </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Similarly, Advancement Projectâ€™s Urban Peace Academy, the only publicly supported training program for gang intervention workers, has trained over 1,200 violence intervention workers and 500 police officers to work together towards violence reduction. Recently, our training of community intervention workers that operate the Los Angeles Summer Night Lights program contributed to a 35% drop in gang related homicides last summer in and around the parks where the program operates. Similarly, throughout Los Angelesâ€™ GRYD zones, where our Urban Peace Academy law enforcement and gang intervention graduates operate, there has been a 30% reduction in gang related crime and 42% reduction in shots fired. As crime rates continue to drop, the Urban Peace program is gaining national attention and requests for our innovative technical assistance have come from Seattle, Memphis, and Sacramento.</p>",19 Voting & civic engagement,06 Access to capital & benefits,,,,

In the last year, weâ€™ve doubled our housing capacity through the creation of permanent supportive and affordable housing. We used to only be able to house 20 youth in our short-term shelter programs (for lengths of stay less than 18 months). Now, we are able to provide youth with their own apartments and continually support them as they grow into self-sufficient adults. At this point, Jovenes is housing 41 youth across our continuum of care- more than at any other point in our history. Our permanent housing programs have a 96% retention rate since opening in 2012.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Launching The Beacon Network in 2011 was a major accomplishment for our organization. As a traditional social-service organization that focuses primarily on the 1:1 work with our clients, taking on TBN required a different skill-set, vision, and capacity. TBN was developed through a process that included gaining input from many different non-profit partners on what information would be most useful to their clients & staff, as well as holding focus groups of youth to test the functionality and clarity of the system, as well as marketing strategies. As a result, TBN Connect has over 4,800 searches per year!</p>",08 Affordable housing, ,Foster youth,,,

This past fiscal year alone, we responded to 328 emergencies and assisted 457 families, opening 10 shelters and activating feeding canteens more than 15 times. This is only possible through our dedicated staff and volunteers taking the required training, being on-call, and working as a team to support the communities we serve. It is this preparation that allows us not only to respond to emergencies here but also support national operations such as Superstorm Sandy. To date, we have deployed four Emergency Response Vehicles and more than 160 staff and volunteers from Los Angeles to the East Coast. In addition to supporting relief operations, deployment also helps our local volunteers to get the hands-on experience they will need when a large disaster occurs here at home.
  
  
  
  
  
  Additionally, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region was very successful in launching the PrepareLA campaign last year. The combination of a public awareness campaign and new Community Ambassador and Faith-Based programs have already started to create a word-of-mouth, multiplying effect that has resulted in a 66% increase in the number of individuals participating in free preparedness education presentations. While two years ago our volunteers were cold calling community and faith-based organizations and schools to offer these free services and were being largely turned down, now we are facing the challenge of keeping up with the increased demand.
  
  
  
  
  
  Other major accomplishments during fiscal year 2012 include:
  
  
  
  
  
  o Conducting free Preparedness Education presentations to 24,871 individuals (almost half of these presentations were directed towards vulnerable populations including 34% youth and 6% seniors); 
  
  
  o Providing 27% of Preparedness Education presentations to individuals in languages other than English, including: Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog, and Thai;
  
  
  o Making 321,411 impressions at community events;
  
  
  o Enlisting 14 Community Ambassadors to represent 23% of Los Angeles communities;
  
  
  o Securing 35 Faith-Based affiliates, whose partnerships drove over 15% of our Preparedness Education requests;
  
  
  o Engaging 1,595 Youth and Young Adult Volunteers via 52 Red Cross Youth Clubs;
  
  
  o Increasing the number of trained and ready-to-deploy Disaster Volunteers to 1,611;
  
  
  o Augmenting our sheltering capacity from 210,000 to 258,149 spaces;
  
  
  o Completing 144 new shelter surveys, which provide us with critical information regarding how many individuals will be allowed at each shelter site in an emergency; and
  
  
  o Adding the capacity to serve an additional 150,000 meals a day through new agreements, which will enable us to serve nearly 2 million meals a day in the event of a catastrophic disaster.",18 Resiliency, ,,,,

With a focus on young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care in the nation. Childrenâ€™s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980â€™s we transitioned from focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping children safe from harm. Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation. The California Department of Social Servicesâ€™ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Childrenâ€™s Bureau a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team which acts as a training model for other organizations. Childrenâ€™s Bureau continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives. We are one of a small group of agencies in Los Angeles County nationally accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children, Inc. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Our NuParent program received international recognition in Spring 2012 with an invitation to present the program, measurement tools and results at the 8th Annual British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>In 2008, we successfully completed a $22 million capital campaign and opened our new headquarters in one of the poorest, most densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles. From this center we launched the Magnolia Community Initiative - a ground-breaking model for large scale community mobilization where children, especially those under age 5 living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education and health milestones and in the nurturing they receive. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Our Magnolia Community Initiative has rapidly gained the attention and recognition of national leaders, policy-makers and funders including members of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, The Tides Foundation, United Way Worldwide, Gates Foundation and East LA Initiative. Through our work with the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, we have collected and mapped the school readiness of young children in a 500 block area of Los Angeles. We are using this mapping data to help local communities map their needs and service gaps on a highly localized basis and engaging the community to improve these outcomes.</p>

http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/MADEbyDWC.html,2015051,Downtown Women’s Center,http://www.dwcweb.org/MADE/program.html,311597223,https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein=311597223,Nonprofit,"Over our 35-year history, the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center has created innovative programming focused on meeting the unique needs of homeless, formerly homeless, and extremely low-income women. When the Center first opened in 1978, it was the first and only resource for women living on Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row.
  
  
  
  
  
  In 1986, DWC opened the United Statesâ€™ first permanent supportive housing for women, a program that has since been modeled as a national prototype. DWC now offers 119 units of permanent supportive housing among our two Residences to women who are primarily elderly, mentally ill, and/or physically disabled. More than 95% of the 500 women we have served through our Residence program have remained permanently housed.
  
  
  
  
  
  We have also scaled up our housing efforts beyond our own 119 apartments by piloting our Critical Time Intervention (CTI) model with clients housed off-site. Our CTI model, a proven evidence-based program launched in 2011, provides intensive case management for individuals transitioning out of chronic homelessness, ensuring that they have the support and access to resources they need to stay housed. DWC is also committed to sharing best practices; this April, our Director of Clinical Health Services and Lead CTI Case Manager will present DWC's CTI model at the Housing California Conference in Sacramento.
  
  
  
  
  
  As the need on Skid Row has continued to grow, DWC is grateful that we have been able to expand our programming and services, offered through our Day Center, Learning Center, two Residence locations, and on-site Medical and Mental Health Center. In 2012, DWC served 4,300 women with 90,000 meals, 23,000 showers, and 6,500 case management and counseling sessions. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Along with our direct service, DWC contributes to national and local policy discussions and to best practice research in service provision for people experiencing homelessness. In 2001, DWC spearheaded the Downtown Women's Action Coalition, addressing womenâ€™s policy and research needs. The coalition has since performed several needs assessments for women on Skid Row.
  
  
  
  
  
  DWCâ€™s well-reputed history is a testament to our mission and work in the community. DWC received a Los Angeles Office of the City Attorney Commendation in 1993, a Bank of America Neighborhood Excellence Initiative Neighborhood Builder Award in 2007, and ""Organization of the Year"" by the Los Angeles Business Journal in 2011.
  
  
  
  
  
  Several other organizations have utilized DWC as a prototype for creating services for homeless women, including Friends In Deed in Pasadena, and organizations in San Francisco, San Jose, Amarillo, Texas; and New Orleans.
  
  
  
  
  
  Finally, we attribute our long-term success to the overwhelming community support and volunteer efforts that allow us to make the greatest impact with limited resources. DWC has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon Service Enterprise by the state of California, and our model has been developed into a case study in best practices in nonprofit volunteer engagement.",05 Workforce development,09 Homelessness,,,,

Our mission is to build healthier, stronger and safer neighborhoods through the creation of urban parks and community gardens. We are dedicated to bringing accessible, recreational green spaces to LAâ€™s most park-poor areas. Through grassroots organizing, community leadership development, and programming, we empower residents in low-income areas to transform their neighborhoods through action, involvement and ownership. This unique and highly effective business model delivers parks and gardens where they are needed most, eliminating bureaucracy and assuring long-term sustainability. Based on census tract data, we currently serve approximately 21,240 residents annually with our parks and gardens, and will add the equivalent of seven football fields of green space by 2015. 
  
  
  
  
  
  In 2012, we completed six projects, including: building two new parks (Fox & Laurel Park & Community Garden, set to open summer 2013); a new childrenâ€™s community garden (Mariposa-Nabi); a community garden at an existing park (Unidad); and a major remodel of another garden (MC Francis). Through a tax default process for non-profits, we were able to purchase an existing garden (Glazer) and protect it from public auction. We worked with committee members to hold 50 community meetings, 15 cleanups and 10 community-led events, and offered leadership training and educational and recreational programming. 
  
  
  
  
  
  In a general sense, our most important achievement is the creation and implementation of a unique methodology. We emphasize grassroots organizing and community involvement in the creation and management of our spaces. We work with the community to identify vacant land in low-income areas for future park and garden sites. Properties are acquired fee-simple or leased and held in perpetuity to ensure protection of the site. Outreach is performed in the surrounding Â¼ mile, mobilizing nonprofits, schools, parents, health clinics and community groups. Meetings are held to see if residents want a park and what facilities they desire. Community Organizers help residents create a park stewardship committee, identify neighborhood needs and train volunteers to spearhead planning, development and maintenance. Whether the goal is to grow fresh foods, provide after-school activities or create a place of beauty, projects fulfill community needs. Our management approach ensures long-term community involvement, proper maintenance and stewardship.",16 Access to parks & green space, ,Planning and public space,,,

As a for-profit business, Public Matters designs and implements neighborhood-based new media, education and civic engagement projects for social change. It cultivates cross-sector partnerships between grass-roots organizations, academic institutions, neighborhood residents, youth and local municipalities. It builds relationships and develops future leaders. We have a track record of innovative, impactful projects. Our project timelines favor deep, long-term engagement, with work measured in years not months. Our most important achievements are those we accomplish through our programs:
  
  
  
  
  
  Market Makeovers, Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) â€“ Funded by a five-year grant through the National Institutes of Health, we worked with Torres High School, Roosevelt High School, The Office of L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina (D-1), Volunteers of East L.A., other local organizations, and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in East L.A.; two more are forthcoming in Boyle Heights.
  
  
  
  
  
  Market Makeovers, Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative â€“ Funded by the California Endowment, we worked with The Accelerated School, The Office of L.A. Councilwoman Jan Perry (CD-9), and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in South Los Angeles and created a media-rich online resource, www.marketmakeovers.org.
  
  
  
  
  
  PDUB Productions â€“ We worked with Pilipino Workers Center, HyperCities, UCLA REMAP, The Office of L.A. Councilman Eric Garcetti (CD-13), and local stakeholders to create an innovative youth media + civic engagement program through which local youth created digital content about Historic Filipinotown for distribution on multiple platforms: interactive Mobile Hi Fi Tours via mobile devices and a Pilipino Jeepney; and HyperCities, an online, map-based time-travel application. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Working with mostly low-income students of color, we have a strong track record of creating emerging adult leaders. Defying the odds of low college admission rates for East L.A. students, our entire class at ELARA was accepted into a four-year college. Past students have gone on to colleges and universities including Brown, NYU, Sarah Lawrence, UCLA, and UC-Berkeley. We have helped place youth leaders in local nonprofit jobs. We currently have four Proyecto MercadoFRESCO young adult leaders who are implementing Market Makeovers, training high school students, conducting cooking demos and social marketing campaigns. 
  
  
  
  
  
  Our work has received national and local recognition. Twice, weâ€™ve been awarded the MacArthur Foundationâ€™s Digital Media and Learning Award, as part of HyperCities and Out The Window. Our projects have been covered by NBC, CNN, BBC Latino, Associated Press, L.A. Times, KCET, Next American City, and MIT CoLab, among others and will be featured in a forthcoming Harvard University Press book about Digital Mapping.",19 Voting & civic engagement, ,,,,

Max is a nice guy who never volunteers for anything. No reason why. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big Sunday hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00 a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)
  
  
  
  
  
  Also: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a year-round community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civic-minded kids; The End of the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.
  
  
  
  
  
  We have won all kinds of awards, and been cited and recognized by all kinds of nice and impressive groups.
  
  
  
  
  
  Truly, though, our most important achievement lies not in how much we've done, but the spirit in which we've done it. We are proud that we've brought many people to a new part of town, be it South Central or Beverly Hills, for the first time. We're proud of our ability to cross racial, religious, age, and socio-economic lines to bring nice people together to enjoy one another in all kinds of ways.",20 Volunteerism, ,,,,

This year, 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of RAP camping programs.
  
  
  
  
  
  Annually, RAP serves several hundred thousand people including more than 1,000 youth daily in our after school programs, more than 60,000 youths in our sports leagues, and 75,000 in summer day camps. RAP has worked cooperatively with other City entities and outside agencies on numerous foundation, state, and federally funded grant programs with budgets ranging from approximately $5,000 to more than $15 million. 
  
  
  
  
  
  For the past five years RAP has partnered with the Mayor Villaraigosaâ€™s Summer Night Lights (SNL), an anti-gang program that keeps parks open after dark with organized activities for at risk youth, and provides job opportunities and a safe place to spend the summer. By empowering communities and targeting the traditionally most-violent summer months, SNL has become a national model for violence reduction. Since 2008, SNL has expanded from 8 parks to 32 city parks, leading to a 57% reduction in gang-related homicides in SNL neighborhoods. 
  
  
  
  
  
  In 2011, RAPâ€™s One Wattâ€™s Program, a cluster of programs serving residents of the Nickerson Gardens, Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts housing developments and the 109th Street Recreation Center, became the first park program based in Los Angeles County to win the â€œGovernors' Council on Physical Fitnessâ€ gold medal since the competition was created in 2006. The Wattâ€™s One Program was awarded for bridging communities through its innovative recreational programs that promote physical activity, fitness and well-being of California youth. Hundreds of boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 12 years participated in soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and flag football programs in efforts to unite the Watts community.",16 Access to parks & green space, ,,,,

http://maker.good.is/myla2050/projects/FallenFruit.html,2016076,FALLEN FRUIT,http://www.fallenfruit.org,557066495,,For profit,"The three artists in Fallen Fruit, David Burns, Matias Viegener and Austin Young, have been developing their collaboration for nine years. We began simply by examining what was growing in our own neighborhood in Silver Lake, and we found numerous overlooked fruit trees, often a bit neglected, growing in or over public space. We mapped them, wrote manifestos about them, documented them and then brought people to see them. <p>
  
  
  
  
  
  Our neighborhood began to transform: more trees appeared and people started picking the fruit. We mapped other neighborhoods nationwide, and were invited around the world to create a range of work on things from the vast expanse of berries in the arctic to the contentious history of banana plantations in South America. <p>
  
  
  
  
  
  Our most ambitious project to date was EATLACMA, a yearlong residency at LACMA in 2010, which included an exhibition, five artist-commissioned gardens, several events including two Public Fruit Adoptions, and a day-long curated performance and intervention in the museumâ€™s spaces that broke attendance records. It was funded in part by a $100,000 MetLife Foundation Community Connections Grant, and received over 100 million press impressions. EATLACMA included our Public Fruit Theater, an intimate amphitheater built with recycled city sidewalks around an orange tree, which delivered a slow and beautiful performance of the seasons: blooming, leafing and fruiting. <p>
  
  
  
  
  
  In the last three years weâ€™ve had two projects titled Accion Fruta Urbana, one in Tijuana, Mexico, and the other in Madrid, Spain, as part of ARCO 2010. In the latter, we worked to populate a working-class quarter of the city with 50 fruit trees. Temporarily impeded by an uncooperative municipal government, the trees found a home in a communal park, Esta es una plaza. The project was accompanied by a billboard and bus shelter campaign in over 300 locations, which contributed tremendously to raising public consciousness. <p>
  
  
  
  
  
  Most recently, we completed the new Del Aire Public Fruit Park in Hawthorne, near the intersection of the 405 and 105 freeways. Funded by an award from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the park is planted with an â€œeyeâ€ of 27 fruit trees, with 65 trees â€œadoptedâ€ and planted by residents in the neighboring streets. It received a tremendous reception in the press, and KCET is currently shooting a documentary on the park and our collaboration.<p>
  
  
  
  
  
  The proposal for Endless Orchard is the recipient of a 2013 Creative Capital award, which will bring in at least $50,000 in funding for the project. Though this is not its full budget, it offers us a remarkable level of professional support in seeking out further funding and development.",22 Art,16 Access to parks & green space,,,,

Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000 volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This new Mar Vista center increases 826LAâ€™s capacity significantly, providing 2,625 square-feet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30% more students each day through After-School Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last year--a 23% increase from the previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LAâ€™s programs build self-esteem, teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>- 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>
  
  
  <p>- 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>
  
  
  <p>- 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during an 826LA workshop;</p>
  
  
  <p>- 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving tutoring at 826LA.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>Other notable achievements include:</p>
  
  
  <p>â€¢ In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LAâ€™s dedication to the community;</p>
  
  
  <p>â€¢ 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Supervisor Eric Garcetti for our work in the Echo Park community in March 2010;</p>
  
  
  <p>â€¢ 826LA was named a â€œNonprofit to Followâ€ by Philanthropy magazine in 2012;</p>
  
  
  <p>â€¢ On April 9, 2013, 826LA will be honored during the Mayors Day of Recognition for National Service at City Hall by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for our work with the Corporation for National and Community Service and Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA). </p><p>Thanks in part to recruitment, training, and retention practices strengthened by AmeriCorps VISTA members, hours contributed by volunteers at 826LA increased by 40% last year!</p>",20 Volunteerism,03 Teaching & mentorship,,,,

Using research, organizing, coalition-building, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to cleaning up the environment in low-income communities.</p>
  
  
  <p>LAANE helped to launch the Community Benefits movement in 2001 and built coalitions that won Community Benefits Agreements for major economic developments, guaranteeing a wide range of environmental, economic and other benefits for communities. Our groundbreaking work on the CBA for LAX Airport allocated $500 million to environmental studies and mitigations that have reduced noise and air pollution generated by the Airport.</p>
  
  
  <p>LAANEâ€™s work on trucking at the Ports of LA and Long Beach established a â€œconcessionâ€ program that has resulted in scrapping 16,000 polluting trucks and replacing them with trucks meeting the highest standards for low emissionsâ€”reducing truck-caused pollution by 80% to date.</p>
  
  
  <p>We have won approval of policies to uplift job quality and improve job access and training in construction, including developments at the Port of LA, work under the Department of Public Works, and, most recently, major transit projects planned by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. These Construction Careers Policies have already yielded training and employment for thousands of disadvantaged workers and will ultimately reach close to 90,000. One of our newest projects provides for training disadvantaged LA workers to carry out energy efficiency measures in buildings all over the City in partnership with the Department of Water and Power.</p>
  
  
  <p>Much of our work has been about job qualityâ€”beginning with our victory in the 1997 landmark LA Living Wage Ordinance. Since then, we have won other living wage policies and upgraded the original policy several times.</p>
  
  
  <p>We have produced the highest quality research reports on the industries that we have targeted and on poverty and jobs. We developed a communications program that rivals those of many much larger non-profit organizations.</p>
