  Over a one-year period, LACP will achieve the following objectives:

  1)Support the healthy development of approximately 50 unduplicated, at-risk,
  disadvantaged, and foster youth ages 11-19 over a one-year period.

  2)Provide after-school workshops, with a healthy meal, for two-hours on
  Wednesday and Thursday each week with 10-15 students per session.

  4)Teach youth how to safely and properly use tools, equipment and machinery
  that are necessary for working on automobiles.

  5)Provide hands-on vocational skills training to learn how to bleed brakes,
  change oil, rotate tires, and other components of car maintenance and repair.

  6)Provide a variety of media to translate skills into art and offer monthly
  educational field trips to explore Los Angeles County. 


  In order to measure the success of our programs, LACP will solicit feedback
  and take testimonials directly from the students. Currently, LACP is receiving
  positive responses from 100% of the youth participants that our services have
  changed their lives for the better. The youth have confirmed that LACP
  workshops have improved their vocational skills, given them an outlet for
  healthy self-expression, and have experienced things they never thought
  possible from the field trips. As LACP is a new organization, we are looking
  at additional ways of capturing program outcomes. Quantifiably, we track the
  number of students at each workshop session and the number of times they
  return to continue participating in LACP programming.

  Lost Angels Children's Project provides an engaging after-school program
  serving local at-risk and foster youth. Twice a week, 10-13 youth attend the
  LACP facility to participate in workshops for two-hours. Youth, ages 11-19,
  learn classic car restoration and customizing techniques, which provide job
  and life skills training, character building, and enforces academic subjects
  of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM).

  LACP is committed to providing a safe after-school environment where the youth
  can develop skills necessary to take with them and elevate them beyond their
  present condition and become positive participants in their community, while
  learning a trade. 


  Along with learning how to work on cars, workshops foster and stimulate
  student creativity, critical independent thinking and personal responsibility.
  Each week the students are encouraged to challenge themselves and take the
  skills learned in the car restoration process to

  create a work of art of their own design which opens inner self creative
  discovery and knowledge that everything learned in class can be applied to
  other fields. LACP gives our students a guide in which to develop practical
  skills they can take into the real world, and learn how these useful skills
  can be turned into a pathway to finding jobs and gratifying work in a field
  they enjoy -- without turning to the streets.


  The overarching goal of LACP is to provide a minimum of 50 unduplicated
  at-risk, disadvantaged and foster youth with hands-on vocational skills
  training, mentorship, and development activities that can prevent anti-social
  behaviors, break the cycle of poverty, and promote a successful future.
