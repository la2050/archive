  42% of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of the economic
  distribution remain in the bottom as adults. To achieve upward mobility, we
  require education & life skills to succeed in today's career paths, as well as
  the resources, networks and tools to achieve our definitions of success.
  Through real-world experience from venture creation, mentorship and habit
  adoption, WeThrive will train and equip more than 800 middle school students
  with the life skills & resources for upward mobility.

  Imagine a world where we partner together as a community to teach young people
  the skills to break their own cycle of poverty and to become empowered to
  reach their potential. WeThrive combines mentorship with business creation to
  provide participants with the skills, resources and tools they need to achieve
  upward mobility. 100% of past participants report increases in self- agency
  and positive peer influence.
   
  WeThrive works with undergraduates at local colleges and universities to
  establish a University-Community partnership through Los Angeles. Middle
  school participants create companies of their own, earn real revenues and
  donate all profits to community charities of their choice.


  Why Middle School?


  According to Johns Hopkins researcher Dr. Robert Balfanz, for most students,
  the process of dropping out begins in middle school, when the habits that
  predict whether or not a student graduates are formed. This is simply one data
  point of a new finding relative to the need for middle school interventions.
  The years leading up to high-school are make-or-break in the educational
  success of students. WeThrive strengthens the transition from middle school to
  high school by providing skills and lessons which are often not taught at all.
  Things like how to find and build your own mentor relationships for example.
  With the teaching of these life skills, our participants exit programming not
  only equipped with what they need to transition to high school, but also what
  it takes to graduate high school, attend college and obtain a college degree.
  Ultimately, WeThrive is part of a necessary change to create a high-quality
  K-16 system in LA for bringing students to a college degree. This is the most
  direct and reliable way of increasing educational capital. 


  By creating a supportive environment that encourages relationship building,
  learning, planning, and financial achievement, WeThrive instills the drive and
  motivation needed to set ambitious personal and economic goals. Through
  programming designed to build skills, confidence, and support networks,
  participants are also provided with the ability to make decisions and take
  actions aimed at achieving those goals. WeThrive is ultimately making LA the
  best place to learn by serving middle school students in Los Angeles who build
  companies within WeThrive while gaining mentors and a support system.
