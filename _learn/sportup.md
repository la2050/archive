  Success for this project will be measured in terms of expanding the number of
  programs that use the SportUp platform to organize, communicate, and learn
  from their data. 


  In addition, our platform will help programs improve their communication and
  organization, by offering them built-in messaging, roster and event management
  and video sharing. As a result, parents, coaches, and administrators will be
  able to better coordinate their efforts to support program initiatives.
  Success for this aspect of the project would be measured in the number of
  messages sent between program members, the number of events created, and the
  number of sport-specific or educational videos shared. 


  Finally, we will also track the number of grants that are secured through our
  community partners with the use of our platform.

  In Summary,

  -Number of teams that are using SportUp platform

  -Number of total participants using SportUp platform.

  -Number of events created on SportUp platform

  -Number of messages sent on SportUp platform

  -Total number of hours SportUp platform saves in operational efficiency. 

  -Total number of philanthropic dollars raised via SportUp data.

  Our system is able to automatically aggregate this data, except for
  philanthropic dollars. We will distribute a survey at the end of the year
  polling our partners to see how much money they were able to raise this year
  with data via SportUp, and how many hours SportUp saved them in efficiency.

  SportUp directly impacts kids in Los Angeles County by making the programs
  that they participate in more sustainable. We work with afterschool,
  community, and athletic programs to help build capacity and engagement by
  giving them a tool to collect and interpreting attendance data. We will
  outreach to local programs and provide them with a platform and advisory
  services that will allow them to leverage their resources to impact more
  children throughout Los Angeles.
project_proposal_impact:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
  - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools

  SportUp directly impacts children in Los Angeles County by making the programs
  that they participate in more sustainable. We are an activity management
  platform that aggregates  attendance, engagement and participant data for
  community organizations. Administrators of these community programs are able
  to view their program data and filter it by gender and grade, and soon to be
  ethnicity and socio economic status. These categories are imperative when
  approaching foundations and other philanthropic sources.  The Advisory team
  then consults with the program administration and coaches them on how to use
  their data, network with funding sources, and advises them on how to improve
  their programs. 


  In addition, we have been working with our community and school partners to
  research and  correlate the data of their programs, to student performance
  metrics: GPAs, attendance/truancy, graduation, and discipline data. By
  utilizing this data, we are empowering schools to be able to identify what
  programs are having the greatest impact on their students. What our initial
  research shows is that afterschool and athletic programs have measurable
  impacts on these key academic indicators. Through our data we can help direct
  funding (and help programs highlight their impact) to the programs that are
  having the greatest impact on children in Los Angeles. 


  Finally, we are showcasing our community programs through published articles,
  pictures and short features that highlight them for our audience, as well as
  create free content that our partners can use to showcase themselves to
  philanthropic sources.
