  Success for the project begins with hiring students and placing them in a
  professional setting. Success continues as students begin to learn and enjoy
  the work that they are doing. We value the perspective of the student and hope
  that at this time they would fully participate in the work setting. We expect
  students with limited skills to grow and improve throughout the course of the
  program.

  The goal of this project is to directly impact students by providing them with
  paid learning opportunities. With the wide scope of divisions within Los
  Angeles World Airports, we aspire to provide students with positions that will
  help develop future career goals. We hope to expand the existing program from
  12 to 25 positions.

  The goal of the project is to allow students to learn as they are on the job.
  It is expected that they acquire skills in customer service, basic clerical
  work, and other business related duties. Having this advantage while they are
  still in school will prepare them for future employment possibilities when
  they enter the workforce. Expanding the student internship program will allow
  LAWA to employ twice as many students in the Los Angeles area. It is essential
  that students actively participate in their community for a well-rounded
  educational experience. Many are advised to volunteer and look for internship
  opportunities. LAWA will contribute to their education and we realize that our
  young people need to be paid. We will provide opportunities to work with
  professionals in fields such as IT, Human Resources, Administration, and even
  Airport Police and Risk Management. Students are continuously and highly
  encouraged to succeed in their undergraduate schooling by all of the
  supervisors and staff. By providing a captivating and stimulating work
  environment, the staff provides an insight into how a degree can open several
  doors and career pathways that students may not have known existed prior to
  the internship.
