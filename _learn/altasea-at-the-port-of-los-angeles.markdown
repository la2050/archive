  AltaSea and our partners are inspiring the next generation to explore the
  ocean and to generate blue solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges:
  food, energy and climate security.

  Our long term measure of defining success will be that students grow into
  champions for a sustainable ocean and planet.  In addition, our goal is that
  students increase their participation in STEM classes in middle and high
  school, attending college, and ultimately choose careers in STEM sectors.
  AltaSea is in the process of developing a tracking system that will allow us
  to keep students engaged with the network.  AltaSea’s 2016 partnership with
  OET is being independently evaluated.  


  Currently, the AltaSea network relies on internal evaluations to measure our
  short term successes. Some indicators of success are:


  * When youth discover abilities they did not know they possess and realize
  they are capable of achieving anything in life through hard work and
  determination.

  * When at-risk students realize what they are learning in the classroom has
  'real world' significance and opportunities for a 'better life' abound at
  shore and at sea.

  * When students make an emotional connection to learning through exploring the
  ocean and develop a love for the ocean and life-long learning.

  * When under-performing students' grades improve and students stay in school
  and pursue STEM-related careers as a result of their participation in our
  programs or Youth Crew.

  * When our community becomes more aware of the preciousness of our local
  waters and threats to marine life, and develop daily 'good stewardship' habits
  to preserve and conserve the oceans entrusted to us.

  Using cutting-edge blue technology and state of the art ocean research,
  AltaSea’s STEM network provides ocean-based programs to middle school students
  at the LA Waterfront. Through hands-on exploration of the ocean, students will
  be empowered to be part of the solution to the planet’s sustainability
  challenges and ultimately to see science/STEM careers as an option. Our long
  term goal is to motivate our youth to be 21st century champions for a
  sustainable ocean.

  AltaSea and our partners, Blue Robotics (BR), Catalina Sea Ranch (CSR), Los
  Angeles Maritime Institute (LAMI) and Ocean Exploration Trust (OET), introduce
  students to ocean exploration, technologies and sciences. Students have access
  to cutting-edge science and technology, one-on-one interactions with
  accomplished scientists, tech innovators and entrepreneurs. AltaSea programs
  strengthen STEM education, develop career skills, inspire entrepreneurialism
  and give students opportunities to see firsthand careers in the blue economy
  sector. 


  Through a bold plan conceived in concert with the community and stretching
  decades into the future, AltaSea is making a lasting mark on LA and the planet
  through leadership, innovation and by inspiring the next generation. The
  program introduces students to the ocean world by sailing on LAMI’s tall
  ships, talking with scientists of the Exploration Vessel Nautilus, learning
  about sustainable aquaculture and new technologies in underwater robots. Our
  long term goal is to motivate our youth to be 21st century champions for a
  sustainable ocean.


  Specific programming activities include:


  Sustainable Aquaculture:  CSR educates students in the importance of raising
  protein sources within ocean ranches and the sustainable methods for
  aquaculture.  The students learn about mollusk breeding programs and how to
  increase productivity and resilience to climate change for this valuable form
  of protein. 
    
  Local Ocean Ecosystems: LAMI programs introduce students to the local
  ecosystem on tall ships. These rigged vessels were purposely built for youth
  education at sea.  In addition to offering a close-up look at marine life, the
  students become a part of a working sailboat crew learning the importance of
  teamwork, nautical navigation and the physics of sailing.


  Ocean Exploration: OET’s President and Founder, Dr. Robert Ballard and OET
  bring the new frontier in ocean exploration to the students' classroom through
  telepresence technology. Telepresence connects scientists, teachers and
  students on shore to live images and real-time data from EV Nautilus and from
  their remotely operated vehicles working on the ocean floor. 


  Blue Technologies: BR use Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to present STEM
  lessons that emphasize critical thinking and the principles of engineering.
  Through lessons which consist of building and operating ROVs, students are
  encouraged to continue their education in engineering and math in middle and
  high schools and to explore careers in ocean robotics.


  The AltaSea network brings STEM ocean experiences to students, inspiring them
  to pursue an education that will lead to careers in the expanding blue economy
  sector. These programs target students who might not otherwise become aware of
  our planet's extraordinary ocean. Visits to AltaSea and the LA Waterfront
  ignite a lifelong passion and curiosity about the ocean, motivating this
  generation to be guardians for a sustainable future.
