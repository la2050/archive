  In collaboration with Dorsey high school and Jim Gilliam Recreation center; in
  the south Los Angeles community, we provide self-esteem building, individual
  and community goal setting, professional development, along with community
  projects as civic leadership and cultural arts    to encourage academic and
  community success. Upon graduating from our programs, we will place youth in
  internships that match their field of interest, while connecting youth to
  networking relationships and mentors.

  Unite a Nation will make LA the best place to learn by increasing and
  encouraging academic excellence, social service and economic growth among
  under-served communities of South Los Angeles. 


  We have created unique innovative educational enrichment programs for
  children, youth and young adults, girls and boys, ages 8 – 24 to end
  generational cycles of poverty and provide youth the resources they need to
  shape them into productive members of society through our four level approach:


  1) Confidence and Communication 2) Healthy Relationships and Mentoring 3)
  Educational Enrichment and Civic Leadership 4) Entrepreneurship and
  Employment.


  Unite A Nation, Inc., has addressed the specific needs of our young people
  (children, youth and young adults). We have identified the solution to the
  problems of our students by creating two unique programs: 1) POWER, 2)
  Brilliant Imagination.


  Program 1. The comprehensive POWER Goal Setting and Professional Development
  programs mission is to build self-esteem, confidence, awareness and resiliency
  in young people, preparing them for positive relationships and successful
  futures through financial empowerment, history, education, mentoring and civic
  Leadership and self-advocacy. 


  POWER is a series of workshops offered year around at Dorsey High School.
  During the POWER program, with funding, we hope to provide the platform for
  each youth to create and adopt a Career Portfolio that contains their life
  goals, personal and professional plan, financial goals, photo’s, certificates
  of completion and awards. The end result is for youth to participate in
  professional Development, Leadership and Exposure through a 6 week volunteer
  or paid work internship that matches their career goals. 


  Program 2. Brilliant Imagination Cultural Arts and Multicultural program's
  mission is to infuse positive self-reflection, developing the minds and health
  of local youth, while refining feelings and thoughts that represent our
  customs and values as a society with dance as our primary focus.


  At Unite a nation, we use cultural art as a refinement or development of
  talents and interests through exposure and training. Along with,
  multiculturalism to examine many group cultures and the things that represent
  them.  Studies prove that Students who participate in rigorous, arts-based
  programs perform better in school and have higher graduation rates than that
  of their peers who do not participate in the arts.


  Lastly, we hope to develop and implement a youth community arts and leadership
  day as a final presentation. Our goal is to bring community and groups
  together as a way of activating unused community space in the Crenshaw
  district.
