project_proposal_description: >-
  We are opening LaunchCode Los Angeles to help Los Angelenos create a new level
  of self-sufficiency through empowering jobs in technology and computer
  science.  Millions of Americans are unemployed and are stuck in low-wage job
  cycles which leave them struggling to find jobs that offer livable salaries,
  employable skills, and a chance for advancement.  Businesses also have a
  problem —there just isn’t enough tech talent to match the growing demand.
  LaunchCode programs address both problems.
project_proposal_impact:
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Over the long term, we know that high paying jobs increase self sufficiency.
  Using the models that we have learned in St. Louis, Miami, Kansas City, Rhode
  Island, Seattle and Portland, we know that LaunchCode participants can get
  placed in real high paying jobs that make a major different in how Los Angeles
  grows as a city.
