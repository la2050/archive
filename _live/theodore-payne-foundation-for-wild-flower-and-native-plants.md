  By bringing beautiful and sustainable native plant landscapes to Los Angeles
  public housing, Grow Local: Plant Native will engage residents and staff in
  making long-term decisions about the future of LA and their own lives. Public
  housing staff will design and install native plant gardens. Youth will be
  hired to learn about native plant horticulture and communications strategies
  in order to create a marketing campaign to shape their communities future.

  It all starts with water. In this fifth year of drought, the urgent need to
  save water is on everyone’s mind. From local utilities to state government,
  from brown lawns to dry fountains, it’s impossible to escape signs of the
  drought. Drought has brought urgency to the task of crafting a more
  sustainable Los Angeles, and is an exceptional opportunity to make LA more
  livable for all its residents, human and otherwise. 


  Grow Local: Plant Native extends our concerns beyond water conservation, to
  bring sustainable choices, practices, and landscapes to residents of all ages
  and the staff of LA public housing. 


  Theodore Payne Foundation and Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles
  have been working together to pilot native plant gardens at four public
  housing sites throughout LA. The Foundation has trained the Authority’s
  landscape staff and some residents in basic native plant horticulture.
  Foundation staff is guiding crews through design, installation, establishment,
  and maintenance of new plantings at San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, Imperial
  Courts in Watts, Estrada Courts in Boyle Heights, and Mar Vista Gardens in Del
  Rey.


  With Grow Local: Plant Native, we seek to extend this project to Rancho San
  Pedro, and closely engage the Rancho San Pedro youth in shaping the future of
  their city.


  Objective: Train staff and establish 20,000 square feet of native plant
  landscape 

  Training for public housing staff 

  * Site assessment, design, and layout

  * Installation and establishment

  * Maintenance 

  Native plant material

  * 1,200 1G plants

  * 16 boxed trees


  Objective: engage a cadre of youth through three, ten-week sessions

  Develop a deeper understanding of where they live

  * Learn about native plant and urban ecology

  * Visit nearby natural reserves on field trips

  * Identify and report bird and insect colonization of native plant landscapes
  using iNaturalist.org

  Shape their living environment

  * Propagate native plants for extending gardens

  * Develop garden designs

  * Develop and launch social media campaign promoting native plant landscapes

  Materials 

  * Sets up for plant propagation 

  * Tablets for social media campaign and accessing iNaturalist.org

  * Camera for creating videos


  It starts with water, but it doesn’t end there. Native plants protect the air,
  and ground and marine water resources because they require little or no
  fertilizers or pesticides. No aerial application of pesticides will impact
  residents and there will be no potential outgassing from artificial grass.
  Further, when compared to tuft grass, established native gardens use 80% less
  water yet these lush, habitat-rich environments include shade trees that
  invite people to go outside or take a walk. In the face of climate change and
  an uncertain economic outlook, converting turf to resilient native plant
  landscapes will allow public housing resources to be used on other priorities.
