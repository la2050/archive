  ' We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals,' - Immanuel
  Kant.

  This project is to spay or neuter feral cats, give them needed medical care
  and then socialize them and find them loving homes or place them in managed
  colonies. This improves the quality of communities who are overrun with
  homeless felines and gives the kitties a chance at a healthy life.

  - Resilient communities
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Our communities are overrun with unwanted cats. Thanks to the ASPCA, residents
  can now have domestic pets fixed free of charge. But these groups are
  unequipped to handle feral cats at anywhere near the numbers present in out
  communities. This project, working with private vets and a network of feline
  rescues, will at low cost address the need for care and spay or neutering of
  homeless, feral felines. This will improve the living conditions for both our
  community members and these cats. Dr. Yoo will also at no charge be hosting 3
  volunteer interns to help with the project and will be conducting workshops on
  trapping, emergency first aid and other aspects of feline management and care.

  This effort will improve life in our LA communities as it will address a
  concern that our citizens across LA express though calls to LA animal control
  (county and city) and the more than 15 non profits who will utilize this
  spay/neuter opportunity. A full list of groups is available upon request.This
  will allow current, limited resources to be reallocated to other programs for
  animals, including low cost medical support and adoption efforts though animal
  control and volunteer groups.
