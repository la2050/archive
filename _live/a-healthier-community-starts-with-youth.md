  The HCSY program provides an opportunity for students to receive mentorship
  and experience within the public health field as they build and conduct
  community health programming with professionals.
project_proposal_description: >-
  HCSY seeks to build sustainable programs that empower Health Systems to
  educate communities in understanding and improving their social determinates
  of health. This is done via a park prescription platform. Physicians provide
  prescriptions for their patients with nutrition & fitness barriers to
  participate in UCLA-Fitted fitness instruction, disease specific Grocery Store
  Tours, and Growing Grit, a gardening and mindfulness workshop. The programs
  are lead by youth from corresponding communities.

  A Healthier Community Starts with YOUth (HCSY) will make LA the best place to
  live because, it directly address health disparities faced by residents of
  South Los Angeles. HCSY is a public health education and career pipeline
  program exposing youth to a culture of upstream preventative thinking. The
  program model provides an opportunity for students to receive mentorship and
  experience within the public health field as they build and conduct community
  health programming with professionals. Students and professionals will be
  collaborating on three programs focused on improving skills around nutrition,
  fitness and mindfulness. 
   
   Participants of these youth led programs are patients that have been identified by their primary care physician as having barriers to nutrition and fitness. These patients receive a written prescription from their physicians that we call park prescriptions. A patient participating in the park prescription program will partake in a 10-week program that provides personalized fitness instruction, nutrition education via grocery store tours and a gardening and mindfulness workshop. 
   
   Undergraduate students leading the workshops will receive mentorship and public health career exposure from graduate students as well as professionals in the field. Undergraduate students will in-turn mentor high school students and expose them to the paths of higher education. 
   
   The final phase of the program will include a train-the-trainer component for representatives of Community Based Organizations to conduct this programming in their own communities, spreading and sharing the effectiveness of this program to communities beyond.

  HCSY vision is to make a healthy lifestyle possible for all Angelenos by
  translating the best practices known in the science of public health
  demonstrated by youth and adults in their communities. HCSY will realize this
  vision by collaborating with physicians as well as public health and community
  professionals to mentor and teach youth. Youth-led public health programming
  will be deployed via park prescriptions. Park prescriptions are an evidence
  based strategy that encourages patients to use parks and open spaces for the
  purpose of improving their health. Success stories in Washington DC, San
  Francisco and Tuscon have shown to have physical, mental and even social
  health benefits. HCSY is collaborating with MLK Outpatient center, UCLA Fitted
  Fitness Program and Netiya Gardens to train students to conduct 10-week
  nutrition and fitness workshops. The Program is supported by UCLA Clinical
  Translational Science Institute-Community Engagement Research Program
  (CTSI-CERP) which will manage the programs evaluation process.
project_measure: >-
  UCLA CTSI-CERP will manage the programs evaluation process. Measurement tools
  include a community based needs assessment, a pre and post patient reported
  outcomes survey (PROS), and pre and post health screenings (reported from the
  participants primary care physicians).
   
   
   
   AIMS:
   
   - Improve the health outcomes of patients suffering from or at high risk for metabolic diseases specifically (obesity; diabetes; heart disease; and hypertension). 
   
   - Provide exposure to hands on fitness and nutrition education via physician referred park prescriptions.
   
   - Expose youth to public health practices
   
   Measurable Objectives:
   
   - 80% of participants report increase in produce consumption 
   
   - 100% of participants who report increase in produce consumption will show corresponding health improvements (controlled A1c levels, BMI, and blood pressure) 
   
   - 90% of participants demonstrate understanding of how to shop and eat healthier.
   
   - 90% of patients report increase in physical activity 
   
   - 80% of patients report higher confidence in their ability to maintain healthy lifestyle practices demonstrated in the park prescription program.

  We hope to see the Healthier Community Starts with YOUth vision realized,
  which is to translate the best practices known in the science of public health
  demonstrated by youth and adults in their communities. Promoting a culture of
  healthy practices in even the most under-resourced communities.
