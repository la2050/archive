  SÜPRMARKT brings affordable organic produce to the people and places that need
  it most in a weekly pop-up grocery + subscription service which accepts EBT
  and educates to create a culture of health.
project_proposal_description: >-
  SÜPRMARKT has served up 1200+ cases of food since starting in 2016 and seeks
  to expand its operations by opening a 6 day a week location, serving organics
  to 1000 customers per week, and providing the community with engaging
  screenings, workshops, events, and giveaways which make transitioning to
  healthier lifestyles easy and fun. Our activities will impact health
  disparities which make diabetes in areas like South LA 25% higher than West
  LA.

  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  More healthy Angelenos makes LA the best place to live because people
  empowered to eat well are in an excellent position to take charge of their
  lives and communities in other ways. 
   
   
   
   LA is already esteemed as a health capital, and our initiatives present a great opportunity to spread that culture to people from all ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds.
   
   
   
   Living in a food desert means there are no incredible places to eat and this limits an area's ability to attract restaurant revenue and the dollars of residents.
   
   
   
   The CHC states, “when healthy food options are not available in a community, residents must travel to buy the foods they need. To reach their preferred store, five times as many residents of South LA (16 percent of shoppers) have to travel at least 20 minutes compared with residents of West LA (3 percent of shoppers)... often divesting the area of much needed tax revenue, economic development."
   
   
   
   SÜPRMARKT will:
   
   
   
   Increase the amount of people we serve via a physical location which also provides needed meeting space and free wi-fi to an area which lacks it. 
   
   
   
   Improve the diets of up to 20,000 community members by providing natural foods and goods at a subsidized rate 6 days a week. 
   
   
   
   Generate $500,000 to underwrite program costs. 
   
   
   
   Help 24 vegan manufacturers become established to serve their community long term Generate revenue necessary to underwrite costs of physical location, and social impact costs.
   
   
   
   Use events, programs, and print materials will create infrastructure for a better future in food. 
   
   
   
   Lead 20 workshops, dinners, and screenings which share great vegan food and skills with the community will provide the one-one one support individuals need to change their lives.
   
   
   
   Produce 100 recipes + videos will show customers how to use the food they get and cards in the boxes will help children and adults identify potentially unknown food they are receiving.
   
   
   
   Create consistent content and branding across web, print, and social media platforms, with a body of 25+ materials which will serve as a baseline for influence, education, and outreach. 
   
   
   
   Reach 700,000 video viewers and 40,000 event attendees with exponential impacts to close network, family and friends.
   
   
   
   Leverage staff stipends will increase our ability to support and engage our volunteers who are critical for our ability to serve our mission and for growth.
   
   
   
   Forge vital partnerships with local and national business, schools, and churches the create a widely spread messaging campaign which inspires Angelenos to eat well.
   
   
   
   Track instances of reversed or improved conditions of disease amongst those it serves.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our initial target areas include: South LA, Compton/ Watts, Hawthorne/
  Gardena, and East LA.
   
   
   
   Our tactics for reaching our goals include:
   
   
   
   12 screenings a year in partnership with other organizations which educate viewers about health and surrounding issues and provide action items. 
   
   
   
   Biweekly food demos which provide guests with materials for healthy staples at home and the knowledge of how to prep them.
   
   
   
   Biweekly giveaways of food, body, and lifestyle products which further a healthy lifestyle.
   
   
   
   Lifestyle change sponsorships in which 200 angelenos receive 1 on 1 help to transform their kitchens, gain all needed kitchen equipment, and learn new recipes and skills.
   
   
   
   Creating a physical location at which guests can receive natural foods and lifestyle items (detergent, etc.) at subsidized prices.
   
   
   
   A school and community institution outreach program which will lead 100 demos over 2 years on healthy lifestyle changes.
   
   
   
   A fund for up to 1000 free deliveries for those who demonstrate need.
project_measure: >-
  We will measure our impact using social media metrics, by counting customers
  and subscriptions, by event engagement, and by counting cases of food. 
   
   
   
   We will also collect data, document, and quantify customer reports of eating more produce because of our service, changing their diets, and clearing medical conditions such as obesity while using our service. 
   
   
   
   This project validates the viability of healthy and helpful businesses in low income areas and helps create strong wellness-driven presence across disadvantaged areas in LA county. We intend to become brand ambassadors for health empowerment for underserved audiences, creating excitement and new mindsets about eating in the popular discourse. 
   
   
   
   We will know we have been successful if we have created a culture of better diets and increased knowledge around food issues in our target areas, and we will use the methods described above to measure our success.
project_five_years: >-
  We hope to have a thriving physical location and be in position to open more
  centers in food deserts nationally. We hope to have sparked lifestyle changes
  in 10,000 individuals, have welcomed 40,000 guests at our events, and be
  serving 2000+ with produce weekly. We hope to be incubating healthy food
  manufacturers intra-community in LA. We also hope to be self sustaining and
  able to run the majority of our programs using produce sales without the need
  for outside funding.
