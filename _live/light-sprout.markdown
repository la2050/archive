  Empower Me cultivates a community of healing for sexual assault survivors and
  their advocates through story sharing, medical and psychological resources,
  and avenues for justice.

  Light Sprout is collaborating with ProSocial, Take Back the Night and is under
  review with Community Partners, though we have a backup plan if they do not
  approve fiscal sponsorship.

  The application provides an ideal, tangible mechanism for measuring outcomes
  and impact. Each visitor to the app will be registered, and through
  storytelling, we can track usage and usefulness over time. 


  We are building a clickable prototype that will be tested in the community
  before testing an online version of the app, which will allow us to make the
  necessary changes in time for the live launch. This will cost a few thousand
  dollars extra up front, but allows us to save thousands later. 


  We will combine quantitative data that can be obtained from the application
  backend together with qualitative feedback from focus groups and assess the
  effectiveness and reach of the application in the community and ways it can be
  improved over time.

  Light Sprout will develop “Empower Me”, a digital tool that provides
  important, immediate and ongoing resources to equip sexual assault victims and
  their allies from the moment it occurs, through the process of seeking justice
  and healing. This would take them, their family and allies out of isolation
  and empower them to make informed decisions and access vital support systems
  to accelerate the healing and justice seeking process. Empower Me is easily
  accessible and free of charge to all users.

  - Healthcare access
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
  - Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences
  - Mental illness

  Empower Me will make LA the best place to live by creating a safer and more
  just city where a resilient and thriving community of sexual assault survivors
  and their allies take control of their healing and challenge rape culture. 


  In America, a person is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. 1 in 5 women and 1
  in 33 men have been victims of sexual assault, but only .006% of perpetrators
  are convicted. 50% of transgender people experience rape, but 68% of all cases
  go unreported due to a long-ingrained stigma, which continues to persist
  today. These survivors have one thing in common - they all need healing and
  justice.


  Light Sprout collaborated with ProSocial, an LA based strategic planning
  company, to research the most prevalent issues survivors face, the resources
  available and where additional resources were needed. We found that survivors
  and their families are still living in isolation, shame and confusion. There
  is an acute lack of the guidance necessary to heal and seek justice in the
  immediate aftermath and the years that follow. 99% of current resources are
  allocated to rape prevention rather than support for those already victimized.
  A central hub where victims and their advocates can find support and
  information required is clearly needed. Resources for minority and LGBTQ
  groups are scattered, making it difficult for these marginalized communities
  to get the help they need. Empower Me will thus be the first app to aggregate
  resources for all survivors, inclusive of their gender, race or sexual
  preference. 


  Additionally, Empower Me will be the first platform specifically targeted to
  survivors’ family and loved ones, as it is essential to provide resources to
  those who care for the survivor post trauma. These great people are allies and
  must be equally equipped with resources necessary to effectively support
  survivors. This ranges from assisting in completing a rape kit to collecting
  evidence, what to say and not say, and how best to care for the survivor and
  themselves. Sexual assault is often also traumatic for the ally as some feel
  lost, inadequate and overwhelmed.  


  Storytelling has been proven an essential feature of community building and
  combating the isolation survivors and their allies face. Empower Me will
  highlight both the traumatic aftermath and forms of recovery which will propel
  the movement against rape culture forward.


  Empower Me will be a trusted and instantly accessible virtual advocate
  designed to eliminate the anxiety around seeking medical and legal help in a
  logically constructed and user-friendly mobile environment. The multiple
  features of the app are thoughtfully combined to mitigate the physical, mental
  and emotional trauma from sexual assault, while providing outlets for support
  as it will be linked to Take Back the Night for free online counselling, legal
  advice and advocacy alternatives.
