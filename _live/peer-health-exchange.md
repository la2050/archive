  We train college student volunteers to teach a skills-based health curriculum
  in under-resourced high schools that lack health education.
project_proposal_description: >-
  In collaboration with our partner high schools and local community clinics, we
  aim to promote health equity through providing resources and access to health
  education. We will do this by conducting a series of in-person clinic tours
  with 9th-grade students throughout Los Angeles County to increase awareness of
  the available health resources in their community.

  Our vision is that we, with our partners, will advance health equity and
  improve health outcomes for young people. By providing students with in-person
  health clinic tours at local community clinics, students will be able to
  familiarize themselves with the knowledge of health resources available in
  their communities. Young Angelenos will learn that by visiting a community
  health center, they can: get a free physical, free STI testing, free pregnancy
  test, free vaccines, receive counseling for drug and alcohol use, and speak to
  someone about mental health. These essential takeaways can help young people
  be prepared with the knowledge, skills, and resources to make healthy
  decisions, and lead healthier lives. 
   
   
   
   Studies show that young people navigate difficult decisions on a daily basis, many of which pose serious consequences to their health and well-being. In particular, young people in under-resourced communities are often faced with emotional distress and trauma without knowing how to seek help. Preventable health issues, such as mental illness or teen pregnancy contribute to the staggering reality that over one million high school students drop out of school each year. Together with local community clinics, we plan to increase health literacy and appropriate utilization of care by young people.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our clinic tours will help increase the knowledge for young Angelenos on where
  and how to access health resources in their communities, thus making LA a
  better place to live. Our focus is on 9th-grade students who attend Title 1
  schools in South LA, East LA, and the San Fernando Valley. PHE works with high
  schools whose students are not receiving comprehensive health education and
  are disproportionately at risk for serious health risks.
project_measure: >-
  We will define success by reaching many young people across Los Angeles, and
  informing them how to access health resources in their community. We will
  conduct surveys after the program to determine studentsâ€™ gained knowledge of
  the clinic tour.
project_five_years: >-
  In five years we hope that the clinic tour work will reach many young people
  across Los Angeles and inspire students to know what kind of services their
  local community health center provides. We hope to advance health equity and
  improve health outcomes for young people across Los Angele County.
