  HCP is a diverse group of experienced consultants working with organizations
  seeking solutions that create positive impact. Twenty years working in applied
  technology and mobilizing the LA community.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Engaging all Angelenos especially Latinos to drive while using a multilingual
  distracted driving prevention app will move the transit score moving the
  needle in the right direction. Car accidents is one of the four leading causes
  of death for Latino/Hispanic populations in Los Angeles. Implementation of new
  technology to drive engagement to ignite the activation catalyst. Incentive
  programs — various cash and media rewards — for continuing use of the app over
  90 day periods.
project_areas:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Los Angeles digital space
project_proposal_mobilize:
  - >-
    Influence individual behavior (e.g. change consumer spending or increase
    conservation activity)
  - Increase donations to organizations and causes

    Data collected on distracted driving will be analyzed and summarized for
    media placement along with academic publication.

  Our program to eliminate distracted driving will reduce the numbers of
  premature deaths by car accidents. The County of Los Angeles Public Health
  lists premature deaths from car accidents as the third leading cause
  countywide. The Hispanic population is the ONLY racial group among four that
  includes premature death by car accidents as one of the four principal causes
  of premature deaths. The bike score will be improved by mobilizing the LA
  community through a digital and bilingual strategy (the ProTextMe app) that
  will prevent drivers from using their phones while driving (or biking).
  Realtime outcomes data will provide an unprecedented dataset that will
  document distracted driving activity and program impact. HCP principals
  routinely publish scholarly papers on the outcomes for programs in which we
  are involved. ProTextMe has sponsored scholarly publications on their European
  program outcomes. We will work with our media partners and LA2050 to publicize
  the program and its outcomes on social media. LA will become the model for its
  program to eliminate distracted driving, especially among diverse communities
  for which we are famous. This approach that uses mass media and academia
  provides exposure in two important communities: public awareness and the
  highest standards of scrutiny.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Our strategy is to cast our net far and wide. Translate and use our digital
  tool that will be translated into Spanish. Hispanics/Latinos are the majority
  in LA County and the plurality in LA City. Our team brings together experience
  in healthcare, digital and public policy campaigns and strategies; in
  particular using platforms and tools in Native or preferred Languages. Our
  projects history has demonstrated our commitment to and skills working
  traditionally hard to reach or not looked at LA communities.
project_measure: >-
  The ProTextMe (PTM) app collects real-time distracted driving data including
  screen touches while the vehicle is moving and at rest. We will follow the
  protocol in the 2017 published study that used the PTM app. Findings
  identified screen touches by other apps including WhatsApp, Facebook, SMS,
  etc. Success will be measured by a reduction in total screen touches, touches
  while moving (reduction) and still (increase), and touches by specific app. We
  will share our findings by specific apps with the companies. Our
  http://miltolinfoundation.org/team/ Mitt Olin Foundation (MOF) board members
  will be helpful in promoting corporate responsibility as one of our aims.
project_five_years: >-
  This activation will create a path to support community and statewide
  involvement with distracted driving prevention, reduction of accidents and
  deaths attributable to distracted driving. We will create the template for
  targeting Hispanic and other specific ethnic communities, using technology in
  target languages to prevent deaths and increase education and utilization
  and/or change behaviour. Our project will establish the distracted driving
  movement by adding realtime objective metrics that will be the agent of change
  of vehicle accidents because of distracted drivers while texting.
